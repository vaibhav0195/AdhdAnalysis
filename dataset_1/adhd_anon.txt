28ea10d2360b6211935fd6b31f4ee9ed92e9eb23fe4d2ebc1c5bec335d571ae9;;;I went through 700 reddit comments and collected 131 ADHD pro-tips!;;;So there was that awesome [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/ifsln9/lets_share_lifechanging_adhd_tips_that_weve/?sort=top) with a bunch of ADHD'ers sharing **real tips** that have changed their life.  I thought it was a great change from most advice on the internet which is written by non-ADHD'ers (and it's painfully obvious that it is).  I read through the 700+ comments and paraphrased, merged and categorised all the tips.  &#x200B;  The 131 tips are split into the following categories:  * General * Cleaning * Memory * Time Blindness * Distractions * Getting Things Done * Emotional Dysregulation * Sleep * Relationships * Work * School * Executive Function * Nutrition/Medication  # General  * Pack things the day before so you don’t forget \~ **(**u/digi-cow**)** * Don’t drink alcohol. Causes brain fog and it can negatively interact with medications. Alcohol can even cause ADHD-like symptoms in non-ADHD people \~ **(**u/HiTechTek**,** u/beatadhd) * Do Cardio before you need to do stuff that requires sitting. It helps you focus. \~ **(**u/robertaloblaw**,** u/beatadhd) * Use text-to-speech generators to help you read webpages/books \~ **(**u/elliptical_orbit**)** * Keep things at eye level (Especially notes/todo lists) \~ **(**u/asmugone**)** * Be stupidly early to places just in case you forget something \~ **(**u/asmugone**)** * Stretch once in awhile. \~ **(**u/theweirdo_nextdoor**)** * Take a deep breath. \~ **(**u/theweirdo_nextdoor**)** * Take a cold shower in the morning or turn it cold just for 30-60 seconds at the end of your shower. Wakes you up, gets your blood flowing and gets you out of the shower. \~ **(**u/Juan_Creamsicle**,** u/beatadhd) * Get a therapist if you can. \~ **(**u/fineandnormal**)** * If you aren’t diagnosed: Actually get a diagnosis and a therapeutic programme that works for you. Don’t spend more time wondering - you’ll still feel like an imposter afterwards, don’t worry… \~ **(**u/Little_Blue_Shed**)** * Most important for me has been telling myself all I need to do is floss. Usually you'll end up chaining the rest of your night routine tasks like brushing onto that. \~ **(**u/amazona_auropalliata**)** * Buy a whiteboard to sketch out things when your mind starts going into overdrive. \~ **(**u/bkmilli**)**  &#x200B;  >**🌟 My Favourite:** Enjoy the journey more than the destination, don’t be in a hurry to finish something you are doing, but always at least do something small everyday. Life is not a race, rather, it is an accumulation of smaller improvements to oneself. \~ **(**u/ksettle**)**   >   >*People are in such a rush these days… You can’t expect to become a superhuman overnight. Focus on sustainability first and enjoy the journey.*  # Cleaning  * Have a designated spot for every single item (Put it in the same place every time) \~ **(**u/BrownShoeJenny**)** * Have a “misc” basket in each room. If you’re truly unable to put something away, put it in the basket. Have a designated period of time, once a week, when your sole priority is to put everything away, all at once. \~ **(**u/lexid22**)** * Whenever you lose something that you “put away,” start keeping it in the first place you looked for it. \~ **(**u/FullDisclosureDaemon**)** * In order to not get overwhelmed when cleaning, remember there are only 5 things you need to tackle: Trash, Laundry, Dishes, Putting things back that have a place, Put things in a pile that don’t have a place. \~ **(**u/mmc09**)** * If you’re moving from one room to another, take the item with you that needs to go to the other room. It’s already on your way and it’s one less thing cluttering your room. \~ **(**u/SweetTeaBags**)** * If you can afford it: Get a cleaning person; It takes them 3 hours to do what you can do in 3 weeks. While they are there, use them as an accountability buddy and sort out your misc tasks like paying bills. \~ **(**u/swarleyknope**)** * Embrace chaos. Let your brain get distracted when you’re cleaning. Cleaning dishes and stop spare trash? It’s fine go clean that and then get back to the dishes \~ **(**u/DobbythehouseElff**)** * Have a dedicated playlist for cleaning. High tempo songs help keep you moving. \~ **(**u/DobbythehouseElff**)** * Do chores before you go to bed. No matter what your routine is, you have to go to bed at some point. You can “habit-chain” cleaning into going to bed. \~ **(**u/bkmilli**)**  &#x200B;  >**🌟 My Favourite:** Listen to podcasts/audiobooks when doing chores. My excitement to listen to a new episode of my favorite podcast motivates me to do boring stuff like dishes or laundry. (I personally listen to podcasts) \~ **(**u/dani-tp**)**   >   >*Cleaning became so easy once I started using a “side” to stimulate my brain. I’m mostly watching TV shows when I clean right now (this also works for cooking!) .*  # Memory  * Having a tablet like an iPad Pro is helpful for keeping colorful notes. Avoids issues losing notebooks \~ **(**u/zombiessalad**)** * Park in the same place every time when you go to a common place. You won’t forget where you park that way \~ **(**u/gibbousboi**)** * Keep a spare house key in your car and one outside your house. \~ **(**u/GoodGuyVik**)** * Keep important items in visible and convenient locations. e.g: Take pills when you eat? Keep your bottle beside your table where you eat. \~ **(**u/girlabout2fallasleep**)** * Get a Tile. Bluetooth GPS trackers that are a game changer for ADHD people that lose keys/wallets. \~ **(**u/fizzzzzpop**)** * Tape your most often made recipes to the inside of your kitchen cabinet doors. \~ **(Unknown)** * Three point check when you close the front door: Phone, wallet, keys \~ **(**u/cowboyhugbees**)** * Use voice assistants. “Remind me to do X tomorrow at Y time” \~ **(**u/theviciousfish**)** * Use the mind palace memory exercise to help solve retention issues. \~ **(**u/asmugone**)** * Keep forgetting your lunch? Put your keys on it. That way you can’t leave without your lunch \~ **(**u/Therealdickbut**,** u/Maktube, u/mismanager) * If you need to remember to bring something with you the next day, place it right in front of the exit door so you HAVE to touch it before you leave the house. If it’s something in the fridge, put a sticky note on the exit door’s handle. \~ **(**u/lexid22**)** * Buy multiple items that you use often. Setup multiple chargers at work/home (so you have a spare if you lose one). e.g. buy 10 different lip balms so you can always find it when you need it. \~ **(**u/redbananass**)** * Have convenient, labeled spaces for things. It’s hard to forget your phone when you ALWAYS put it beside your charger. (Use a cheap labelmaker!) \~ **(**u/TotallyLegitEstoc**,** u/nathanb131) * Get a tracking tool like Tile and put it on things you lose regularly. (Keys/Wallet) \~ **(**u/3GrilledJalapenos**)** * Have rules for placement of the important things in your life. (it’s too hard to do it for everything) \~ **(**u/nathanb131**)** * Create a second brain for yourself - in whatever way is most appealing to you. (I personally use Notion) \~ (u/significanttoday**)** * If you want to remember something, put an object out-of-place whilst thinking about what you want to remember. \~ **(**u/VectorGambiteer**)** * Count your steps as you walk into a new room. It’ll help you remember why you entered that room. It gives you something to focus on but it’s not too much that you’ll get distracted. (This is similar to many forms of counting meditations too) \~ **(**u/bethknowsbest**)** * Use a bowl to throw your keys, badges, and wallet into when you get home. That way you can’t leave without ALL the stuff you need. \~ **(**u/pockunit**)** * ALWAYS have a bag with the essentials. On mine a have my keys, charger, papers and even tooth brush. If I’m going out, I do not waste time searching for everything. Just search for a bag. \~ **(**u/sdjrp**)** * Make a calendar entry for every scheduled thing religiously unless it’s routine like a 9-5 job. Make the calendar entry immediately while making the appointment. Do this for parties, birthdays, dates, finals, med refills, trash night, etc. \~ **(**u/percyjeandavenger**)**  &#x200B;  >**🌟 My Favourite:** Use Spaced Repetition to study for your exams, remember things about people in your life, and literally everything you can possibly make a flashcard for. \~ **(**u/beatadhd**)**   >   >*Is it narcisstic to put my own tip as a favourite? Well who cares, it works! Spaced repetition is fantastic and honestly* ***feels like cheating***\*. There are a lot of free tools out there which work great. I’m currently using my own private tool\* 😉  # Time Blindness  * Set your phone clock 10-15 mins fast on purpose \~ **(**u/Anonredditthoughts**)** * Put appointments in your calendar 10-20 minutes earlier than the actual appointment \~ **(**u/Alyscupcakes**)** * A schedule is only as good as the alarms and info you put in \~ **(**u/asmugone**)** * Set timers for activites you hyperfocus on. BUT set the timer for X minutes less than the task takes. (Give yourself time to wrap up whatever you’re working on) Additional Protip: Use this on a watch rather than your phone to avoid getting distracted. A basic watch/smart watch will save your life. \~ **(**u/dinamyte519**)** * Download an app on your phone that chimes and buzzes every half an hour during your awake time. Keeps you aware of how much time has passed. \~ **(**u/Frosty172**)** * Track your time. Every morning, write out a todo list by hand and track the time taken for each task. (Write down the time whenever you take a break or switch tasks) - I personally use Toggl to track my time \~ **(**u/ImprovedMeyerLemon**)**  &#x200B;  >**🌟 My Favourite:** Get an electric toothbrush with a timer. ADHD people have time blindness and it’ll make sure you brush for at least two minutes. \~ **(**u/insaxon**)**   >   >*Yes. Two minutes can feel like two hours for me. Or I’ll brush for 20 seconds and think five minutes has passed. I can’t trust my brain, so I started using an electric toothbrush with a timer*  # Distractions  * Disable all your notifications on your phone except for essential apps (Texting, Voicemail, Calendar) \~ **(**u/kee_kee**)** * Use website blockers for distracting websites *(I use Cold Turkey, Freedom and News Feed removers for social media + Youtube)* \~ **(**u/elliptical_orbit**)** * Get a good pair of noise-cancelling headphones + non-distracting music/audio \~ **(**u/elliptical_orbit**,** u/michaeltheobnoxious) * If you can’t stop yourself from answering that text/email/IM right away but don’t actually have time to deal with it, tell the person you’ll respond when you get a minute. \~ **(**u/theweirdo_nextdoor**)** * Your brain focuses better after some exercise. *Cardio works best* \~ **(**u/unofficialuser112**)**  &#x200B;  >**🌟 My Favourite:** Use a noise-cancelling headset and listen to music/white noise/brown noise. Enables hyperfocus and blocks out distractions (“I don’t regret getting diagnosed late, but I do regret getting noise cancelling headphones that late in life.”) \~ **(**u/rn7889**)**   >   >*Stop scrolling right now and go buy the noise-cancelling headset. A noise-cancelling headset + some noise like music/brown noise is essential if you have ADHD. Feel free to thank me later once your life changes.*   >   >*If the headset isn't in your budget: Brown noise + earphones will get you 80% of the way there.*  # Getting Things Done  * If you have an Android: Put a widget from your todo list app on your home screen so it’s the first thing you see \~ **(**u/kee_kee**)** * Break tasks down into as many smaller tasks as you need for it to feel manageable. \~ **(**u/theweirdo_nextdoor**)** * Learn to plan around transitions. It’s easier to start things if you chain them with another task that is ending. \~ **(**u/lexid22**)** * Use the pomodoro technique for everything. It’s great having a break to look forward to. \~ **(**u/ontapeina_sthrnaccnt**)** * Remember that something is better than nothing. If you only get 26% of a task done then it’s further than if you never started. It’s better to do little bits of every task rather than procrastinating. \~ **(**u/xxxistentialist**)** * Attach numbers to events. e.g: Going to bed (3) - Brush, Floss, Mouthwash. \~ **(**u/Frosty172**)** * Lie to yourself. I’ll tell myself that I’m just going to unload one dish from the dishwasher. Once I’ve started, I’ll at least unload a few, and maybe clean the whole kitchen. \~ **(**u/coffeeclichehere**)** * Decide what you’re going to do each day beforehand, preferably while your meds are at their workingest. Make sure it’s only 1 thing. \~ **(**u/optimisticaspie**)** * Understand that FUTURE YOU IS STILL YOU. If you think you’ll do something later, understand that future you is still you. Future you isn’t more likely to muster up the desire to do the work. f you don’t have the motivation to do it in the next 24 hours then future you probably won’t either. \~ **(**u/Moon_In_Scorpio**)** * When you need to transition between tasks, pretend that you are talking to a friend who is having issues with something. Give yourself a nudge and remind yourself it’s time to switch tasks/get started. (Detach yourself from the task) \~ **(**u/Gerryislandgirl**)** * When you take breaks, make sure your break isn’t too interesting. That way you won’t get absorbed in your break. Just clean during your break or something like that. \~ **(**u/Treppenwitz_shitz**)** * Gamify things and set a limited amount of time to accomplish something. e.g: Brew your coffee and get as many chores done as you can before the coffee is finished brewing. \~ **(**u/strngrsstpngstngrs**)** * Write TODO lists as a brain dump. And then order them in importance or the order you want to do them in. That way you don’t pause while writing down tasks. \~ **(**u/strngrsstpngstngrs**)** * Don’t be afraid to stimulate yourself if you need it. Listen to a podcast or music to get yourself to do something. \~ **(**u/fineandnormal**)** * Reward yourself when you get things done. Positive Reinforcement is good and you’ll feel like getting more things done. \~ **(**u/prince-ali-but-short**)** * Change your environment and work from a place where there are fewer distractions. e.g: Cafe/library. You’ll get more stuff done \~ **(**u/humbled_lightbringer**)** * Set a time to do work, and a time to relax; that way you don’t feel guilty about relaxing during the time you set aside for yourself. \~ **(**u/talking_face**)** * Change your alarm sounds/timer sounds frequently, but use alarms and timers as much as possible. \~ **(**u/Little_Blue_Shed**)** * Treat timers and alarms like non-negotiable laws. When the timer goes off, doesn’t matter what you were doing seconds ago, it’s time to go. Half showered, wet hair, one eye done, whatever it is, you’re out the door. \~ **(Unknown)**  >**🌟 My Favourite:** Body doubling - if you need to do some work that requires focus without much fun, have someone in the room with you. They could be working too, or not. Just having them there makes everything just a little more interesting and a little more accountable. \~ **(**u/Creebjeez**)**   >   >*I feel like a lot of people are missing some sort of accountability system in their lives. I don’t do body doubling but I use Beeminder to keep me accountable.*  # Emotional Dysregulation  * Brain dump in a notebook by your bed every night. \~ **(**u/ALyscupcakes**)** * Don’t feel bad about sucking at school/work. You’ll get better as you learn more strategies for coping with ADHD. Things get better \~ **(**u/astrozork321**)** * Use writing/journaling as cognitive therapy to defuse emotional history \~ **(**u/Tman1307**)** * Remind yourself that the world won’t end if a few things fall behind. \~ **(**u/theweirdo_nextdoor**)** * Write a reverse todo-list. Write down the things you have accomplished for the day. That way you won’t feel overwhelmed and it’ll make you feel better. \~ **(**u/SuspiciousEchidna**)** * You’re allowed to let things go. Forget irrelevant things and forgive yourself. Ignore the awkward thing you did last week. Life will move on. \~ **(**u/bitetheboxer**,** u/optimisticaspie) * Forgive yourself for your limits. \~ **(**u/3GrilledJalapenos**)** * Meditation. Active breaks for people that struggle to take breaks. Use a meditation app when you’re starting. Like Headspace \~ **(**u/Juan_Creamsicle**)** * Start working on letting go of shame. It depresses your motivation and only makes things worse. You wouldn’t shame someone in a wheelchair for not getting things done, your difficulty is in your brain instead of your legs but it’s no less real. \~ **(**u/percyjeandavenger**)** * Cognitive Behavioural Therapy + meditation **\~ (**u/beatadhd**)**  >**🌟 My Favourite:** You’re allowed to let things go. Forget irrelevant things and forgive yourself. Ignore the awkward thing you did last week. Life will move on. \~ **(**u/bitetheboxer**,** u/optimisticaspie)   >   >*Stop hating yourself. Don’t look at the future. Don’t look at the past. Look at the present. I used to always hate myself for being so unproductive. I realised how pointless that was and I started to focus on improving myself in the* ***present.***  # Sleep  * Put your phone on the other side of the room and make your alarm super loud. Gets you out off bed and will make you turn it off so you don’t wake other people up. \~ **(**u/Valendr0s**)** * If you’re having trouble getting out of bed then set a timer on your phone for 5 minutes and chuck it across the room. It’ll force you to get up and turn it off. \~ **(**u/PMDicksInTinyClothes**)** * Buy 2 bright lamps and 2 timers. Set them up to turn on automatically 5-15min before you want your alarm to go off in the morning. The lights help your body know its daytime \~ **(**u/lexid22**)** * Change your thermostat so the temperature goes down an hour before bedtime and gets warmer 30 minutes before you wake up. The cooler temperatures get your body to sleep and the warmer temperatures help you wake up \~ **(**u/lexid22**)** * Use a reminder app for starting your bedtime routine, not just your bedtime. (And have a bedtime routine) \~ **(**u/3GrilledJalapenos**)** * Try setup meetings/commitments early in the morning. They'll force you to get out of bed \~ **(**u/beatadhd**)**  &#x200B;  >**🌟 My Favourite:** Set two alarms when you get up in the morning. One to get out of bed and one for your medication. e.g: 5:30 AM wake up and take medication and then fall back to bed. By your 6AM alarm you’ll have waken up and your meds will have kicked in \~ **(**u/BizzarduousTask**)**   >   >*What a great lifehack.* *I’ve been doing this the past few days (except I don’t wake up at 6AM) - it works pretty well. Also I throw my phone on the other side of the room so it forces me to get out of bed.*  # Relationships  * It’s okay to be in a room with people and just let people breathe. You don’t need to fill the silence. \~ **(**u/asmugone**)** * When having a conversation or learning something, repeat every word the person says in your head. It’ll help you not drift off as much. It also makes it so you’ll interrupt people less. \~ **(**u/TheNocturne**)** * Try to avoid the word 'but' when faced with a conflict. Instead try be constructive towards arguments/discussions with the word 'and'. \~ **(**u/beatadhd**)**  &#x200B;  >**🌟 My Favourite:** For maintaining eye contact: Imagine a red dot on someone’s nose for intense focus. Bridge of the nose for paying attention. \~ **(**u/asmugone**)**   >   >*Haven’t tried this one but I used to have trouble with eye contact a few years ago so this stood out to me. I’m pretty good with eye contact now, but I’ll be trying it over the next few weeks anyway.*  # Work  * If you hate your job. Make a job switch. It’ll help you make positive changes in your life. \~ **(**u/Mooberry_**)** * Find a job that works WITH your system. If you can’t wake up and be functional in the morning then stop trying. Find a job that doesn’t need you to wake up in the morning. Stop beating yourself up over things your brains isn’t designed for \~ **(**u/obxunseeker**)** * Be self-employed and start a business. “No matter where I worked or what I did, I was constantly watching the clock, hating every single second of it. On Saturday I worked 27 straight hours to finish a job on time and it was still less painful than working an 8 hour shift as an employee. Those 27 hours disappeared and left me feeling gratified because I made someone’s house beautiful and I got to see how happy I made her the first time she saw her new home.” \~ (u/jake7697**)** * When promising a timescale to a client, double or triple the amount of time that you initially think it will take. That way worst case scenario, you will finish it on deadline and meet expectations or best case, finish before and exceed expectations. \~ **(**u/Somewhereonabike**)** * The moment you know you aren’t going to make a deadline, let the client know and again give them an overestimate of time for new deadline. People are always understanding and appreciative for this quick communication. \~ **(**u/Somewhereonabike**)** * Reply to emails and messages when you read them. 99% of the time, days and weeks will go by if you tell yourself that you’ll reply later on… \~ **(**u/Somewhereonabike**)** * Be honest about your limitations and own your shit. Most people have no idea how much adhd affects so many things and therefore can’t understand our inability to do basic things at times. Especially if you come across as smart and creative, they can misplace our struggles for laziness and lack of care. If you fuck up own it, explain why and apologise. It doesn’t have to be long winded but it is important to state how you aim to rectify the situation and again. \~ **(**u/Somewhereonabike**)** * Stop comparing your output and motivation to others and embrace a slower, more considered, creative one. You are not other people. You are you. Trying to jam your freeform, 12 sided shape into the round hole is painful and won’t work. You don’t need a hole, you need self acceptance. \~ **(**u/Somewhereonabike**)**  &#x200B;  >**🌟 My Favourite:** Learn to say no to taking on things that you know may cause you stress and excess pressure just because it’s money. It is not worth it, just put the boundaries that will save your mental health in the first place and you won’t have to deal with the fallout later. The more you do it, the easier it becomes. \~ **(**u/Somewhereonabike**)**   >   >*God yes… ADHD people have a dangerous habit of overcommitting to stuff. Personally I think I just forget that I’m already working on X, Y and Z. Sustainability is important - don’t overcommit.*  # School  * Use Active Recall + Spaced Repetition to study for all your exams. I've seen countless people go from C's to straight A's after adopting them \~ **(**u/beatadhd**)** * If you're finding it difficult to start assignments early then ONLY read + annotate the assignment brief early and go take a break after that. Your subconscious should process the information and it'll be easier to start later on. \~ **(**u/beatadhd**)** * It’s better to turn in an assignment that is 75% done. It’ll drag your grades down less than if you never turned it in \~ **(**u/bitetheboxer**)** * Print out lectures and powerpoints in advance (ask the teacher for them). That way you won’t need to listen and write at the same time. You can annotate the printed versions instead. \~ **(**u/strngrsstpngstngrs**)**  &#x200B;  >**🌟 My Favourite:** Visit your school's inclusivity and disability team. They will hopefully have policies for helping people with ADHD \~ **(**u/beatadhd**)**   >   >*This is something I never took advantage of while at University, but I probably should have. A few assignment extensions when my meds stopped working would have saved me from countless all nighters…*  # Executive Function  * Setup a morning routine + a reset routine. A reset routine is something you do when you're feeling super unfocused. Mine consists of meditation, exercise, journaling, playing music and making some tea. \~ **(**u/beatadhd**)** * If it takes less than ten minutes to do the task, just do it immediately. \~ **(**u/Zzazu**)** * Have a uniform for work, social and casual scenarios. Don’t mix your work clothes with your casual clothes. \~ **(**u/3GrilledJalapenos**)** * If you start to feel frustrated for no reason, eat something and keep yourself hydrated. (Self-care flowchart) \~ (u/enjakuro) * it’s better to half-ass most things than it is to not do them at all. \~ **(**u/coffeclichehere**)** * Set alarms using music rather than the default alarm sounds. It’ll help you get going. (And music releases norepinephrine in your brain!) \~ **(**u/redditraptor6**)** * Make yourself kits for common repeated household tasks. e.g: Cleaning Kit, Package mailing kit… Reduces the friction needed to get started on a task \~ **(**u/sonjavalentine**)** * Refine your routine and rituals to reduce the overall time it takes to get them ready. Reduce the friction needed to start your morning routine. e.g: Prepare a filled pot of coffee the night before. \~ **(**u/lazyoracle**)** * Set just a few non-negotiable standards and laws for yourself. Pick those that improve your life the most. e.g: No phone in bed at night or in the morning. Not even a quick email check. And read your goals every morning. \~ **(**u/AllsFarrin**)** * When you’re trying to get started on a task: Write down the steps you’ve already done and the steps you plan to do next. Helps a lot with spaghetti thoughts \~ **(**u/qui_gone_Gym**)** * Drink a big glass of water when you know you are going to have to start doing a thing in a bit. When you inevitably have to go pee, start after you wash your hands. You are already up and your brain already had to switch gears. Use it as momentum. \~ **(**u/percyjeandavenger**)**  &#x200B;  >**🌟 My Favourite:** On tough days. Use the 1-thing theory. Just try and accomplish just one-thing for that day. e.g. Clean the kitchen. \~ **(**u/soggysocks63**,** u/GoodGuyVik)   >   >*A bit less life-hacky compared to the others but I’ve found that getting started is a lot easier when you only have a single priority.*  &#x200B;  # Nutrition/Medication  * If you are Vitamin D deficient then take Vitamin D supplements (see a doctor first). It’ll help your mood and energy levels. \~ **(**u/ImprovedMeyerLemon**)** * Eat lots of protein and stay hydrated. \~ **(**u/chlordane_zero**)** * Figure out if you're deficient in anything and try fix those things. This includes getting a food allergy test, figuring out deficiencies and eating a healthy diet. \~ **(**u/beatadhd**)**  &#x200B;  >**🌟 My Favourite:** Use a 7-day pill organiser with AM/PM slots and put your medication and supplements there. \~ **(**u/ImprovedMeyerLemon**)**   >   >*I know a lot of people have issues with remembering if they took their medication. This is an easy, simple and cheap fix.*
4a3c58f52fd09d9db7d1e05ffcdff6498d04c7b30ba6ea1e7cb150de9ea44a04;;;My mom has single handedly found a cure for ADHD!!!;;;I was studying for my exam when my mom called, I told her “please be quick because it’s gonna be hard to get my concentration back” and she said “I mean just focus on your work and don’t think about other things.”  pRobLeM SoLveD tHaNks mOM :’)  edit: i can’t believe how this blew up and while i feel nice, its sad that so many can relate to their adhd being invalidated. keep your heads up kings and queens :))  all the comments are hilarious though and they made my day! (thank you for all the awards too <3 )
6e1195e2e18f5143ec517b534d9e86841635553eea4fadf1e00641dc11810b7b;;;When you buy things, pay the ADHD tax upfront.;;;I've seen a lot of posts about the ADHD tax-- the late fees, the groceries that go bad, lost items, impulse purchases we never touch... you get the picture.  It's real, and it sucks.  One thing I've noticed lately, though, is how sometimes, you can get away with paying a smaller ADHD tax if you plan ahead when you buy things.  Hear me out.  1. I could buy a whole crown of fresh broccoli for like, $1.50, but I won't get around to washing, cutting, and preparing it.  A $2.50 bag of pre-cut, pre-washed broccoli will get eaten.  Instead of a $1.50 ADHD tax for broccoli I won't eat, it's a $1.00 tax for broccoli I will eat. 2. A cute planner or notebook with a great layout is worth $30 if I will actually use it.  An awkward-to-use planner that I'm not motivated to ever touch is useless, and not worth spending even $5 on. 3. With vitamins, if they're not gummies, I won't maintain the habit of taking them.  I'll pay extra for the gummy vites that I will use versus the regular ones I will waste.  Other things include: paying for Spotify Premium because I know that ads (or going to find music elsewhere) will distract me.  Only buying clothes from stores with really long return windows, even if it's pricier (REI lets you return things for a full year, bro).  Paying more for a phone with a really long battery life so it's not dead half the time.   As someone who was raised to be frugal, a lot of this stuff feels kinda shameful almost?  But when I stop and think about it, I stand by my assessment that it's actually cheaper this way.  Edit: thank you!  but please don't spend money on awards.  spend it on pre-washed, fresh cut broccoli, pals  Edit 2: Y'all make some great points.  The encouragement and understanding in the comments is making my whole week.  After some further reflection, some things really stand out to me:  1.  Viewing willpower and energy as limited resources is critical.  Purchases are cost + willpower + energy.  Whole, unwashed broccoli is lower on cost but higher on willpower and energy demands.    -> I feel like we can punish ourselves for wasting time.  Like I convinced myself "don't buy pre-prepped veggies if you're gonna waste 8 hrs on video games, you can spare the time."  But that's basically punishing myself for having ADHD by depriving myself of vegetables I'd actually eat.    -> Besides, maybe the 20 mins I save by having pre-prepped broccoli means I have enough mental energy to wash some dishes after I eat, which means washing dishes on Saturday takes 40 minutes instead of an hour, which means I have enough energy to clean my room, and so on.    2.  Frozen vegetables & fruit, meal kits, and bulk purchases help.  I will also add: did you know you can freeze bread??  Then toast it and it's good!  3.  Point of caution: spending more on something doesn't necessarily mean it's more likely to be used.  We have all been there.  But if something will genuinely be more usable or more functional at a higher cost, it might be really worth it.

Every time someone tries to "tough love" me and motivate me through pointing out that I'm an adult and i need to "pull myself up" i instantly feel worse and even less motivated to do stuff. I wonder if anyone else on here noticed that.  [Edit to add] Guys i have a really warm and fuzzy feeling right now of finally having so many people i can relate to. Thank you for all the responses.
73c603cd04e35d2ac9500b4b15889f1e17557d372434b5b09a5efe8732d71b5a;;;ADHD should really be renamed something like Executive Function Disorder or Executive/Emotional Regulation Disorder;;;It’s wild how misleading “attention deficit hyperactivity” is. How many people have never been diagnosed because they saw the name and were like “*ok I clearly don’t have ADHD because I have attention but I just can’t help where it goes or when, also my emotions and memory and motivation are all whack but who knows why*” and never get the right support they need.  At least give ADHD a more relevant name that doesn’t immediately mislead people.   It not only hinders productive conversation about ADHD but also really downplays the myriad of other symptoms that can have way more serious impacts on people’s wellbeing than something like “Can’t Stop Fidgeting Disorder” suggests.

Whether you're in class or online, if you turn it on during class, Word will live translate everything that's said into text. You can see it typing as its being spoken.   If you have issues with getting up frequently, opening tabs/browsing during lecture, fidgeting, or just zoning out only to come back and have no idea what was said, you can just refer to the notes Word is taking for you.   Its been an absolute game changer for me and makes class less stressful, so i thought some of you would appreciate it too.  Edit: thanks for the awards!! Happy Friday everyone!
2bc55e504022a5e3c0ebe0fee77e7263ca0838db3b6265992c31fb2a3e0198cd;;;“Here’s something that happens to ADHD children a lot: Getting pushed beyond their limits by accident. Here’s how it works and why it’s so bad.” (From a Tumblr post linked below.);;;Child says, “I can’t do this.” Adult (teacher or parent) does not believe it, because Adult has seen Child do things that Adult considers more difficult, and Child is too young to properly articulate why the task is difficult.  Adult decides that the problem is something other than true inability, like laziness, lack of self-confidence, stubbornness, or lack of motivation.  Adult applies motivation in the form of harsher and harsher scoldings and punishments. Child becomes horribly distressed by these punishments. Finally, the negative emotions produce a wave of adrenaline that temporarily repairs the neurotransmitter deficits caused by ADHD, and Child manages to do the task, nearly dropping from relief when it’s finally done.  The lesson Adult takes away is that Child was able to do it all along, the task was quite reasonable, and Child just wasn’t trying hard enough.   Now, surely Child has mastered the task and learned the value of simply following instructions the first time.  The lessons Child takes away? Well, it varies, but it might be:  -How to do the task while in a state of extreme panic, which does NOT easily translate into doing the task when calm.  -Using emergency fight-or-flight overdrive to deal with normal daily problems is reasonable and even expected.  -It’s not acceptable to refuse tasks, no matter how difficult or potentially harmful.  -Asking for help does not result in getting useful help.  ..............  I just read all this and I’m floored.  From:  https://highlycaffeinatedhorsewriter.tumblr.com/post/182580123449/whats-the-real-lesson  EDIT: I totally didn’t expect this to resonate with so many people! We aren’t alone, y’all. I love this community. This is how we heal.💕  EDIT 2: someone pointed out this clarification, that it’s not a wave of Adrenalin but a wave of serotonin:  “The adrenaline release is a physiological response to stress and is responsible for the heightened emotions and arousal, but serotonin mediates the behavioral response. Once that response is initiated, the heightened adrenaline will cause stronger memory consolidation, causing the child to learn to do that task only when subjected to an intense stress response, as well as causing avoidant behavior toward that task at all. The rest is on point though.”

I wake up in the morning, and after putting it off for nearly 2 weeks, I check my university assignment schedule. Turns out I have an essay due tonight. No problem, I’ll finish it after my History seminar, which finishes at 1pm. After zoning out for the hour and a half history seminar, I realize I should really start doing my essay. 5 youtube videos and 30 minutes on tik tok later, I start doing the essay.  Hyperfocus kicks in. 4 hours goes by in the blink of an eye and i’m about 90% finished the assignment. My essay is 100% done, except for my references page—no biggie, i’ve got time. Here comes the self-congratulations, that sweet release of pure pride knowing you actually managed to get something done even though you had 3 weeks to do it. After the pride comes the thought— “hey, i’ll take a little break. i did just grind for like 4 hours.”  that little break turns into hours before you know it. i kept telling myself to just finish the goddamn references, but i didn’t want to. i just spent my “entire” day writing this essay, gimme a break.  fast forward to finally finishing your references and submitting your essay, only to realize you forgot to put one of the citations on it.  fuck adhd.

She left it on the kitchen bench among a pile of toys, rubbish, groceries, and other junk. This morning, it was still missing.  She never loses anything and had no idea what to do.  Luckily, I have lost wallets, phones, keys, medications, books and anything else you can imagine. I'd been preparing my whole life for this moment.  "Right, don't put any rubbish in the bin outside or take anything out of the house."  "It isn't in the rubbish bin..."  "Doesn't matter. A few hours from now, you're going to start to doubt yourself. If we contain the spaces it could be NOW, we won't have to worry later."  She checked the bin and it wasn't there. So we started searching.  After we'd searched all the places a normie would look, we went deep dive. Under the fridge, in pot plants, under the bed, between books, in the fridge, in drawers we haven't opened in weeks, in rooms we hadn't been in.  Every time she protested that I was being illogical I said "It doesn't matter if it doesn't make sense. We can't trust your memory. Remember when my iphone was on the roof of the car for two days? It could be anywhere."  Tonight, she went to take out the bin after checking most of it again.  "What are you doing?"  "Putting out the rubbish. I know it isn't in there."  "Check again."  She took out 80% of the rubbish again.  "It can't be at the very bottom, that's from days ago.  "Doesn't matter."  And there it was!  A lifetime of doubting myself paid off!  TL;DR - My knack for losing things helped my wife find her retainer.     &#x200B;

So my usual coworker is a guy from Syria, he's really nice, works hard, and he's generally a very chill dude. He just doesn't speak the language that well yet. We've figured out a way to communicate though, so there's no problem talking to each other.   A few days ago he was sick, so my boss sent out a substitute to help me at work. She was a white woman, a little older than me, and seemed pretty nice. Everything went well, until lunch.  While eating lunch, we were talking, and the subject suddenly fell on my coworker. She started saying that he's probably a "lazy immigrant", "doesn't do shit", "won't even learn the language", shit like that. I quickly shut her down because I don't tolerate that shit.  And she had the AUDACITY to say "oh, sorry, my ADHD makes me a little racist"  To which I replied "no, it doesn't"  And she asked me "I'm sorry but you don't have ADHD so you can't say anything about my condition"  And I answered with "I have ADHD as well, it doesn't make me racist. You're just a racist who happens to have ADHD"  And the topic got changed so quick.  I'm still so mad about it. There are too many bigots who blame their bigotry on ADHD. It puts everyone else in a bad light.

The days where I can't even get out of bed because my brain can't focuse on getting my blanket off or standing up. Where I can't muster up the dopamine to just brush my theeth or do any kind of work.  Where I just can't seem to feel anything, especially not happiness. And everything just seems tedious and like hard work.  It feels like my brain blows all it's energy in one day leading me to hyper af and unable to concentrate, but other days the energy is just gone.  We need more info on that part of ADHD

I don't remember the exact year that my wife and I had him diagnosed, but I always knew he had it.  My wife didn't always know, but that's a long story for another post.  Many of you are probably wondering what the point of this post is.  Maybe I am too.  But I have been lurking here occasionally, and some of the stories I read break my heart.  So here's my message to this community...   It's okay.    It's okay that I asked you to take out the trash and you forgot.  It's just trash.  It's okay that sometimes you're late for school, and sometimes you forget to bring your homework home.  What I care about are the other times.  The times you come home happy that you made a new friend, or that you got an A.  Or a B.  Or a C.  It's just school.  It's okay that you are sometimes irritable.  Irritating.  Infuriating.  You're also kind.  Humble.  Caring.  Amazing.  Beautiful.  And that's more than just okay.  It's okay that sometimes you're a little hard to follow.   That sometimes you talk about three different things at once.  I wish I knew as much as you, that I had the passion that you have about the things that excite you.    It's okay if you choose to take medication to make your life easier.  Don't like meds?  That's okay too.  The point is this.  You are all wonderful, beautiful, amazing people.  You come from all walks of life.   You've all taken a different path.  Just know that there are people who care about you.  There are people who get you.  There are people who love you, and want you to be happy.  It will be okay.  Edit:  Thank you all for the comments and messages.  Also thanks for the gold/silver/platinum kind strangers.    Most importantly, thank you for reading this and for your responses.  This is an awesome community, thanks for making me feel so welcome.
d970d7a993b36ed50476b0dabadf893483113e09912309c3b0b99c04045090d4;;;Paid 5 people back that I’ve owed money for like a month, deep cleaned my laundry and tidied the entire house with an ADHD hack I’ve heard in a few books.;;;**TLDR - I’ve organised a “power hour” with my mum 4x per week where we effectively swap being each others “life assistant” for an hour each day, 4x days a week.**  I’ve listened to multiple ADHD books that suggest “chore swapping” with a friend. I’ve had this idea to ask my mum if she’d be up for it for weeks but was convinced she would think it’s a stupid idea, but I finally asked her the other day if she’d be up for it and she was!  I have my assessment on Friday (low key terrified I will be told I’m just lazy/anxious/depressed and be prescribed another antidepressant) and my mum is almost has ADHD as well, although is in a little bit of denial.  So I called her the other day and proposed this:  1. At least 4 days a week, we will visit each other for 1 hour at roughly the same time, pending appointments.  2. We will not be upset if the other person is late and we only have an hour - if we’re late, we get less time. We will expect each other to be late so we aren’t upset.  3. We both have to be doing something, even if we don’t feel like it.  4. We will set a timer for an hour, with a reminder 5 minutes before the timer is up.  5. At the start of the hour we’ll set “goals” for the hour and keep each other on track.  6. We can help each other with anything - it’s not limited to cleaning. The example I gave my mum on the phone was that I’ve been struggling to start my tax return, so I just need someone to be there and keep pushing me to do it.  We had our first power hour yesterday and it was AMAZING. When my mum arrived (10 minutes late), I told her I had 5 people I had been meaning to pay back for various things, and that how dirty our laundry was was stressing me out. So she made me sit down and I wrote a list of who I had to pay back while she started the laundry.  She called out to me a few times from the laundry to make sure I hadn’t got distracted.  After I’d finished paying everyone back, I got up to help her with the laundry and she asked where our mop was. I said it was broken and I’d been meaning to order a new one, so she suggested I order it right then and there, so I did!  Once I’d finished that I neatened the entire house. I like to play a game in my head where I pretend I’m a realtor getting a house ready to be inspected but I only have a short time and can’t actually “clean” anything because it’ll take too long, I just have to make each room “look” good from a distance.  When the hour was up, the house was so tidy and the laundry was spotless. Today I’m going to visit my mum and we’re organising her pantry because it’s been stressing her out, and I’m so excited!  When my boyfriend came home he couldn’t believe how neat the house was and noticed the laundry right away. He asked me how I’d got it all done and I, shyly, told him about what I’d read in all the books and the arrangement with my mum, thinking he’d think it was stupid.  He (in a nutshell) said “...wow. That’s actually a really smart idea. You know I’d do that with you if there’s anything I can help you with.”  I just feel so warm and fuzzy and accomplished today and I wanted to share! Hope you guys get something out of this tip and have a friend or family member you can try it with :)  **TLDR - I’ve organised a “power hour” with my mum 4x per week where we effectively swap being each others “life assistant” for an hour each day, 4x days a week.**  *EDIT: oh my god, I didn’t expect this to get so much attention and I can’t wait to (definitely forget to) go back and respond to everyone!! Ahh! Thank you so much!*  I thought I’d let you know how our “Power Hour” went today - I visited her and she decided that the pantry wasn’t stressing her out nearly as much as picking something to wear for an event on Saturday. So she tried on all her outfits and I helped her pick one, then we went only and picked some shoes for her to go buy, then we went through her calendar and picked a good time for her to go get the shoes :)

But I have no idea.  So yesterday, I met with my boss, and confessed that I had no idea.  I suggested that I could dig through virtual meeting records to add up time, etc.  But that, off-handed, I just couldn’t give an accurate answer.  I told him that I recently learned about a symptom of ADHD called “time-blindness,” and that it probably contributes to why I struggle to estimate project timelines.  His reaction?  “Wow.  I’ve never had to think about my time like that.  I’ve taken it for granted my whole life.”  And then he reassured me that he only needed my “best guess,” and helped me estimate my biggest project.  EDIT:  Wow!  Any mods (or bots or experts) out there who can add a definition and example of time-blindness to this post?    A lot of folks have reached out, and I’m sure this community has a vetted answer that we can share.

ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder so medications are not a crutch;;;ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder meaning a condition that is due to differences in in the development and function of the nervous system.  I think it's worth noting for people who think that medications are a crutch that this is **physical problem with our brains** that presents as a mental heath issue.  Taking meds for this is the same as someone taking meds for a heart condition; it's maintenance for the mind.  I had it in my head for a long time that taking meds is a crutch  and it stopped me from getting the help I needed.  This goes for all medication prescribed by your doctor. Self care is not always about the cure but how we manage our illnesses.  edited: some words for better clarity

Update: I did 8 pages and turned it in. I’ve also crocheted 2 cat hats.  It was a good day I would share pics but I don’t know how to on here 😬😬😬  Update 2: HE EXTENDED THE DEADLINE 12 HOURS UGH  Another update: if anyone wants me to crochet them the cat beanie and is willing to pay shipping then I’ll most definitely do it, tips would be greatly appreciated but I’d do it just to make someone’s day! Just message me and we can talk about it for sure!!
86ad65f5d493b7e1b0eaea7507f942cebbde0bafb42d13f056f50b514400c32d;;;I told my boss about my adhd diagnosis and it went perfectly;;;Yesterday I decided to quit my job after 3 years. I emailed my letter of resignation stating my diagnosis and how I had to take time to work on myself. I also told my boss that the new store manager was undervaluing me because she took my quietness and chilled out nature as a sign that I had a bad attitude and no enthusiasm to work there.  I thought that was it. Then he called me and seemed very shocked and upset about my reasons for quitting. He said he totally disagreed with the new managers opinion of me and said that I was a solid rock of our store. He then said he didn't want me to have to leave in the middle of a pandemic (noone else is really hiring at the moment) and made a deal with me.  So, I'm now getting 2 months paid leave and then transferring somewhere away from that manager. I'm so shocked with the outcome and my recent diagnosis made me think I was gonna be fucked forever. I don't know why I'm posting here I'm just really happy
dc937b59892604f5a86ac96936cd7ff09e25f18ae6b758e8014a24c7fa039e91;;;It’s a constant state of “Idgf right now” or “How did I allow things to get this bad?!?” for me. No in between. No normalcy.;;;I know I’m not adulting right, I’ve neglected so much that needs to get done. Haven’t filed taxes in 4 years, can’t handle my finances, I’d fire myself if I was my boss and picture that day happening daily....I should be stressed out and overwhelmed, but my ADHD won’t allow me to care or feel any sense of panic until I’m in imminent danger of ruining my life, or something drastic has already happened...  I wish I could explain it to neuro typicals. How much of a challenge it is to bring myself to do the bare minimums, I can’t do shit without some sort of assistance, motivation or supervision. Let to my own devices I am useless.   But in this world I just have to hide, keep playing the role of “having it all together” game while every second of every day I’m reminded of what a shit show my life is and has been.  EDIT: I’ve been so overwhelmed by the amount of messages and comments this post has received that it brought me to tears a few times.  I wrote it at a moment I felt total despair and frustration and could see no way out. It’s bittersweet that so many can relate, because I do not wish how I feel and have felt on to anyone but being understood feels wonderful. I’ve been reading all the kind words and encouragement to me and others, as and the advice (especially those related to my taxes) and will act up on them, I promise.   I Wish I knew you all and could have you as my family, friends and colleagues instead of the judgmental neurotypicals we are outnumbered by; but this will do. THANK YOU!!

That’s ok. What’s the last thing you remember, and I can fill you in from there.”  • if I’m having issues with an assignment and getting super overwhelmed: “hey, why don’t we take a minute to regroup, and then tell me where you’re having problems?”   • when I’m dealing with sensory overload while we’re out with other friends: “do you want me to make an excuse for you so you can take a few minutes outside?”  • when I’m having problems forming words because my thoughts are moving too quickly and getting jumbled: “ok, slow down, take a second, think about the words you want to say. I’m not in a rush.”   • when I haven’t texted them for a few days because I got distracted and forgot they existed: “hey! How have you been? I’d love to catch up when you have some free time :)”  • when my tics are acting up (my meds make them worse, so they get super obvious when I’m stressed out): “do you need me to distract you for a little bit?”   • when I’m hyper fixated on something and want to talk about it: “tell me all about it!”  These are just some of the things that they have said to me, and honestly it’s super super awesome to see someone who knows the things to say to me when I need it.

dd790caa9bb4b017962a431f3df076c637f3e2c7bf4fcb54b2d9ff328665f421;;;I’m so over going to bed motivated, pumped, about all the things i’m going to do the next day. Listing them off how and when i’m going to do them, almost excited about how productive i’m going to be. But, wake up the next day with no motivation again?;;;Just caught my self doing it again, I got a slew of things I need to do tomorrow. I was thinking about how and when I’m going to do these things, it was going to be good, productive and fun. I then just realized I did the same thing the night before with basically the same tasks. Far from the first and light years from the last, just wondering if anyone has this burst of motivation I guess, just before bed? But, then having it die out when you wake up and have to do the usual slog and compromise of what needs to be done?  Edit: so just woke up and I’m not that surprised a number of other people do the same thing, seems like a classic adhd thing. Thanks everyone for offering tips and tricks, hopefully me and others can find some ways to improve our days and lives. I’m going to try shifting exercise to the mornings, I always feel good after exercise, even if it’s just a walk or some yoga.  Today though, and I hope everyone is okay with this, I’m going to take a rare opportunity of creating accountability. I’m my birthday party tonight and I’m going to list all the things I need to do here and cross them out as I do them. Other people can follow along too, maybe make it a bit competitive. If I fail, idk, be disappointed in me, no one enjoys that.  By the time this post is 18 hours old I need to have:  1. ~~Got fertilizer~~ 2. ~~Got sun shield~~ 3. ~~Cake tools~~ 4. ~~Sponge cake ingredients~~ 5. ~~Beer from plonk~~ 6. ~~Though up easy baked snack and get ingredients~~ 7. ~~Clean outdoor table~~ 8. ~~Wash outdoor chair covers~~ 9. ~~Clean kitchen~~ 10. ~~Vacuum~~ 11. ~~Remove boxes~~ 12. ~~Buy bin~~ 13. ~~Enjoy the company of friends and family~~  Sorry if this is weird, but ya gotta take what you get sometimes. If you can, join along and post your list, we will be productive together.  Edit2: Thanks everyone for the well wishes and support, it does truly help that when ever I sit down I see messages of support and im like "aight, ill do one more thing then, just for you". I just wish everyone could always have someone cheering them on.  Edit3: Appologies for the late edit, I'm quite hammered by this point, I had a few people showing up early so I didnt get to update til now. I got achieved all of what I wanted to to at varyinging degrees degrees of success but, I cant thank you all enought for atleast helping me attempt everything on this list. Without you all I dont know that i could have those afternoon tasks  and for that I am so thankful. I may not haven done everything on that list to the best of my ability, but I gave everything a shot plus more, so thats fucking cool. We should do this more. I can barely type, but I wanna help yall, thanks you wonderful people, lets fo, xxxxxxxx.
7aa046cd0e02ffb3277db56c253ef533ae9fa3e2b10bb6dbd98e45aab523d0be;;;Emotional Dysregulation should be discussed as much as loss of focus with ADHD, if not more.;;;Since my diagnosis and subsequent therapy/treatment, I've been able to identify **how little I'm actually in control of my emotions and how frequently my emotions flare up.** I was diagnosed late(\~25 y/o) and looking back at my childhood/teenage years, there were **hundreds of instances of my emotions running wild without me being able to control them**. During this time, I was able to manage a 2.0-3.5 GPA but **my social life was tumultuous and frightening**. I **lost a lot of trust in those around me** because I thought they **just didn't care as much as I did**, or because **I thought I hadn't done anything to deserve the treatment I received**.   I only wish the aloof, lost-puppy-looking stereotype of ADHD **also included the inability to regulate emotions**, as I think that's one part of ADHD that is **known to some but not most**. It's also a piece that **can be misinterpreted by outsiders as a short temper, or a weak spine, or wearing your heart on your sleeve.** I wish that, one day, non-ADHD folks **could recognize emotional dysregulation alongside loss of focus as symptoms of ADHD and not a lazy, emotional slob**. Maybe it's just me projecting my insecurities, but it feels like the combination of symptoms is often **mistaken for willful lazy assholery.**   Now that medication is helping me with the focus part, the next step(and the harder part imo) is **learning to identify when my emotions are beginning to control themselves** and **how to co-exist with them**. My new goal is to **re-develop healthy social habits** and **the ability to reach out to find new friends.**   Wish me luck, r/adhd. And **may your journeys take you to where you want to go.**
6a7d74bb1f533f422032a594a62c15d213748184d1614d7aff8394345b77e1fe;;;Do you ever feel like you are an adult that needs a "babysitter" all the time otherwise if someone isn't there to make you do things, help you do things, you'll never get much done?;;;I (31F) accidentally hired a babysitter for myself for a couple hours a day for the past couple weeks because my husband was looking for someone to come and help with chores. He has OCPD and needs things to be meticulously organized before he can function at his demanding new job. We both work from home since the start of the pandemic so initially I had volunteered to just do the chores and for him to pay me instead. However this arrangement never worked because the entire pandemic I couldn't be consistent with it and just let things go to disarray (of course) before I did anything. If there were 10 things on a list to do daily I'll do 2-3 and feel very productive. So in the end he was doing the rest of the tasks on the chores list (doesn't help I thought they were ridiculous in the first place).  So he went online to find a cleaner to come everyday for an hour or two to help with the chores. I initially protested to this because to me "we didn't need it". So the past couple weeks we have a girl come everyday. Now I protested because I don't like to sit around while someone else is cleaning up after me when I feel like I can do it myself (on my own time and very inconsistently), so I've been just telling her to just assist me with the tasks. So she's been babysitting me for 1-2 hours everyday and I've never been so productive.  House? Sparkling clean. Bed? Made every morning. Groceries? Done and put away in the pantry and fridge immediately. Dishes & utensils? Unloaded from the dishwasher and stowed away into the cupboards. Laundry? Done and folded immediately. Cats? Happy that we are less stressed out and aren't fighting all the time. We've also managed to cut down on food delivery because I now have the energy and enthusiasm to cook.   I always thought that perhaps I didn't do much because I had no motivation, energy, or time. But it turns out I needed someone else (not my husband) to push me the right way to do things on my own and help when I can't. At my job I still struggle because I'm alone and I dictate what I do with my time (eg won't get much done until the last minute) and don't have anyone to work everyday alongside with.  Since hiring the "adultsitter", I have so much more motivation to pursue weird new hobbies (I want to take up bushcraft so I can pretend I'm a hunter gatherer at least for a few hours). I realized being an adult with ADHD in our society can be very lonely, because we are expected to be able to do things on our own, when really humans evolved to be social creatures. If you can afford to get someone to watch you or even just accompany you to errands you absolutely hate/feel anxious about, get that adultsitter! It also satisfies my innate desire to be able to do things "on our own" since I still put in effort to do the tasks. If you've got a friend or accountability buddy who has time to sit around while you do your stuff, get them to sit around and adultsit you!
88dd607c7e546a50900924b13e61fe3a7b04abb851c001df08568b7ac654a2ae;;;Emotional dysregulation is the WORST when you are on vacation with your family and just trying to have fun, but instead you just feel irritable the entire time for no reason.;;;It sucks because I hype up this trip for a long time, and planned on enjoying myself the entire time and relaxing. Instead, I feel uncomfortable because I’m sleeping somewhere outside of the house in an unfamiliar environment, constantly tired, and quietly getting annoyed by everything my family says or does.          The worst part is, I know this is wrong. My parents are just having fun and I’m getting annoyed at them for no reason, and I’m in a really nice hotel, so I should feel grateful. I can’t say anything to my family because i don’t want to sound spoiled or anything. I just with having ADHD would prevent me from fully living in the moment.           Also I’m not saying that all vacations are stress-free or that NT people never get irritable. But for me, this happens often with multiple trips, so clearly ADHD is creating larger issues for me.            Edit: Thanks for all the upvotes and rewards! I had no idea this was such a widespread thing that specifically happens to us during vacations. To me, I just thought this was just me continuing to feel irritable during vacations, but you all opened up my eyes and made me realize it might actually be the vacation itself that is causing it! Thanks guys!
a9b7cd86af3cb1155f03af36aee88b4cc1b0bac1058c89e44790eef01baecc5b;;;Everyone talks about how ADHD can produce short-term paralysis, but it's the long-term paralysis that really scares me;;;ADHD-induced short-term paralysis is real. You can't get started on something because your brain's going a mile a minute, and the thought of having to discipline your thinking produces a wave of dread that can quickly overwhelm you. I get it; it's a regular thing for me, and probably for most people on this thread.  But less attention is paid (no pun intended) to the long-term paralysis that can result from ADHD: when you're unable to plan for the future because your interests are in a constant state of flux. In order to make progress we need to commit to goals, and in order to commit to goals we need a baseline level of emotional stability ... but ADHD can remove that stability. It can make you feel like disaster is perpetually imminent, so your struggle to avert disaster becomes the only objective you have time for.  Over time this can really knock your self-confidence. The irony of having ADHD is that I'm open-minded but incredibly short-sighted. I take things one week at a time, and my primary objective at any given moment is simply to 'keep it together'.  Does this sound familiar to anyone?

EVERY teacher always used to descride me as the student that "could do very well in school if she could focus and make more of an effort".  The only reason I didn't get in trouble for my hyperactivity is that the teachers never scolded the female students. Each time I talked to my guyfriends during class, they would get the blame. Every time I would bother my guyfriends, they would get the blame. Even when they did absolutely nothing.   The signs were all there, the issues were all there, but they all got overshadowed by the guys in my class that had the more hyperactive type of adhd.    Edit: okay so alot of people are bringing up the fact that the inattentive type of adhd is harder to spot, but I have the combined type and I was hyper and disruptive in school, but my issues still got ignored. I'm not saying that boys with the inattentive type don't go unnoticed too, but I still feel like this is more common with girls
2c8bf1aaf29319f5fe00a8f0f915d25bc2f6ca1899c2c66acf31456a967a1258;;;The hardest thing about ADHD is no-one understands it, you can't explain it, everyone thinks they've got it and everyone thinks there's nothing wrong with you. But your life is falling apart and your told nothings wrong with you.;;;I wish I had dyslexia, autism or schizophrenia. At least then people would get it.  No-one says to dyslexics "I find it hard to read text sometimes too - try reading slowly, there's nothing wrong with you",  ... to our autistic crew - "just think about what the implication of a statement is, just don't get overwhelmed, change is good"   ... to paranoid schizophrenic gang - "I feel like the radio is talking directly to me too sometimes. And I saw a Facebook ad about shoes after looking at shoes online, maybe they're following all of us!"   Even writing this crushes me. I know there are some that'll read this and think - just try harder. Good god, I'm trying. I get the feeling _you_ get when you're hyping yourself up to jump off a 10m diving board *when I open my emails*.   PS I've recently become medicated. Holy shit. Scary as fuck to admit there's something wrong but what a difference. I can have a plan and do the plan.   I wish I could explain the difference to people that don't already know what I mean.  . .  EDIT: This community is amazing - so encouraging and supportive!  You all really helped me (and people reading this thread) to not feel like so isolated.  As an adult with newly diagnosed ADHD it's tough.  It feels like there's been a monumental shift in who I am and how I view myself and my perceived failures, yet everyone around me see's the same old (lovable but somewhat useless) person I've always been!
4d5b47ae2b8151401a3533991e4719b297dcc87d7d8d48581244ee0c6cf018cd;;;Suggestion: On this sub, we should try to say “thanks for reading my rambling” instead of saying “sorry for my rambling”. I feel like apologizing perpetuates some of that good ol’ ADHD shame.;;;I certainly do the “sorry” thing in my life but I’m thinking on this sub, do we have to apologize? Chances are the people reading your post or comment have ADHD and so there is an unspoken understanding.   I know this is a habit and some habits aren’t easy to break. I think it’s totally fine to do the  “sorry” thing if it makes you feel comfortable. This suggestion is mostly a challenge to stop apologizing for being ourselves and having our ADHD quirks.

Literally out of sight, out of mind.  This leads to large amounts of rotted vegetables, cold coffee, and having JUST run out of this thing i really need right now.  To combat this I set myself booby traps.   For example if I happen to notice that my shampoo is running low, I'll set the bottle in the middle of the bathroom floor so that once I'm dressed and ready for my day I will quite literally trip over it, thus reminding me I need to order more.  I often move foods in front of beverages in the fridge so that I have to interact with them, reminding me that I bought Jicama for a reason! Or I will set my meds at an odd angle to remind myself I haven't taken them yet. My house is chock full of items in odd places to help jog my memory along.  What reminders do you have to help with object permanence?  Edit: You are all too kind.  You have given me some great tips to better "trap" myself!   Thank you all very much!!     Also, edited spelling because ADHD hit post too quickly

Clearly, it all affects us differently, and I think plenty of people in this sub have worse symptoms than me, but I think there is a lot of upside to being a creative, emotional, and forgetful ball of energy. I feel so happy, life doesn't feel real. I got a parking ticket today because all I can think about is where I'm going to law school.  Thank you guys for being here, and don't count yourselves out due to your diagnosis!

He then convinced me that I should go be evaluated and low and behold I was diagnosed after 31 years.   Looking back there were so many signs and even a few teachers tried to convince my parents that I needed to be evaluated at a young age. They always claimed that they were just trying to drug me and I’ve believed it my entire life.

But Im fed up of being told I have a superpower.;;;I cannot make a 45 min meal in less than an hour and a half. 30% of the time its gonna be burnt. Im never going to put every single item of dirty clothes to wash. I can't keep up with an argument because I forgot my side and half of what the other person said. An organized plan becomes an improvised mess because I skipped a step. A set of instructions given to me seconds ago no longer exist within my brain.   A hunter gatherer wouldnt thrive with this condition. Forgot what berries were poisonous vs delicious? Bad. Arrived at the hunt with your spear unsharpened? Very bad. Without your spear?  Better punch that mammoth pretty hard.  Creating a company? Amazing!! Just don't forget that very important tax record!!   The hyperfocus and creativity and extra energy are incredible tools, indispensible in many areas of life.   But that's not a superpower. It's not a disorder that someone is lucky to have.  Edit 10h later:Hi everyone!! Really honestly did not expect this to blow up, thank you all for tips and kind words and shout out to all of those who can relate!   Here we find that we are not alone and most importantly, that even whith ADHD many of us can find ways to cope and keep moving forward towards our goals!  Oh and for those concerned, thank you very much but this post is not me giving up, it's just a need to get it off my chest.
bae1e0f74dd181e08f520174bdf232301d014851193ea24a466c82436a9f7d3a;;;Getting annoyed at people calling adhd a super power.;;;Reason why I get annoyed at this comment is because I've always had adhd, especially primarily inattentive type but due to me being female as well as not being the hyperactive type it went undiagnosed all my life until now at the age of 20, I'm finally being medicated and I see the difference.   Adhd for me isn't a super power. Especially when I went undiagnosed, it has ruined my life, everything was ruined because of all the symptoms I have that went unnoticed. It made me not being able to pay attention in class and to get assignments done on time, It left me not being able to go to university at the same time as everyone else despite really wanting to, it left me not being able to keep a job for more than 1 or 5 months at a time, it left me not being able to clean my room despite having mold growing on food and dishes. It also left me impulsively buy things and only to forget about them the next day, or binge eating food until I want to vomit and binge drinking alcohol to the point where I could potentially die, all because I confuse my boredom for extreme sadness, anger issues so debilitating that it has ruined my relationship with my mother due to emotional dysregulation. It made me not being able to keep up with basic hygiene because I would lose time and I wouldn't realise a week has gone by. It made me buy new underwear and wear the same dirty  clothes because I found it too difficult to even pick up my dirty laundry and to throw them into the washing machine even though it's such a simple task.   Yeah I'm funny, outgoing and creative and I can learn easily especially when the task is hands on and I'm able to hyper focus under extreme pressure to the point where I can keep up with being timed on tasks at work. However these qualities are great and all, at the end of the day it doesn't feel like a super power and that it has caused depression and anxiety for me along with shame and self hate.
76eb7967edbaee7d5f73bb0c96c41975d2f37c083883c3813b3ea90096db8e9b;;;I did my homework, earlier then normal and didn’t give up. This is probably useless to most but I’m so f-ing proud;;;Normally whenever I get an assignment, I have a list of options.  Option A: ask a friend for the answers Option B: don’t do it at all Option C: do it during school  While playing on my computer, I just told myself. “You know what? No playing CoD for hours today. Let’s do your assignment and then play”. Hopped on Google Classroom, did my assignment with little to no breaks and felt amazing. Note to self: music is a great way for myself to vibe.  I’m not gonna act like I didn’t question the point of it though. I decently had doubts in my mind haha. “This is too hard, hop on CoD”, “Did we even learn this? I’m not doing something I didn’t learn”, “this question makes no sense. I’m giving up”, etc. I also want to apologize if this is a waste of a post. I’m used to everyone telling me to take my time then get disappointed because I took so long to make garbage. I don’t even know if the answers are right but I’m proud. Anyways, if you don’t care and think I’m a terrible student, fair enough haha   TL;DR: I finally did an assignment on time instead of slacking off and making excuses, asking for answers or doing it during class. I was planning to play my game but decided I should do work first. Music  definitely helped. There was a few doubts that I should give up but I’m proud. I don’t even know if the answers are right. I apologize if this post is a terrible one. I’m used to people telling me to take my time then be disappointed because I took allot of time to make garbage.   EDIT: Thank everyone who upvoted, commented and gave me awards! Means allot to me! I didn’t expect this much love for doing school work haha. You can do anything you put your mind too!  EDIT 2: Guys...2.6K UPVOTES AND TONS OF AWARDS?! Are you kidding me?! Thank you guys so freaking much! I wanna thank everyone for showing support through any interaction they did. If you want to follow my twitch (www.twitch.tv/ihatenikolas) and come hang out, it would also be very cool but not optional. Any support on Reddit already warmed my heart. Love you all <3

After studying for 10 years, and going undiagnosed for 9,5 years of it, finishing something like this is something I never thought was possible.   The last days were depressing because I thought I would have failed my thesis. Normally people were not really invested in my performance, but this being the last part, I was afraid I would have let so many people down again.  For all my fellow ADHD’ers here, don’t give up! Even when it takes so much longer than others. Together, we are getting there eventually! ❤️  Love  Update: Wow guys, I thought a casual 40 upvotes would have already been nice. This amazing response from this group is giving me such an incredible thankful feeling! I will do my best to respond to everyone. ❤️  For who wanted to know: I studied Media and Information at the University of Amsterdam with New Media and Digital Culture as specialization. My thesis title was “YouTube with the trump card in hand?”, where I analyzed the presence of filter bubbles in the YouTube recommendation system when looking for information on the 2020 US presidential election, therefore possibly affecting voting behavior.

His brothers were being very rambunctious, we were packed in a very warm and stuffy car, and needless to say I was feeling very overstimulated. The brothers kept getting out of the car and running around the lights, which made me really nervous. I suppose his mom didn't mind, but my boyfriend and I did. I think she took our discontent with the brothers' antics as being scrooges. I was particularly annoyed because when I'm overstimulated, I get really pissy and that in of itself annoys me so it's a never-ending cycle.  At some point, the mom just turns to me and says, "you know, I like you better when you're off your meds. You're more fun that way!" The ironic thing is that my meds had worn off at that point. That WAS me off my meds. If they hadn't worn off, I might've been able to handle everything better. I told her, "Well, my meds have worn off by now so..." I don't think she heard me.  My meds make it so I can remember things, I can read better, I can articulate myself better, I'm not so angry all the time, and I'm way more confident in myself because my meds help me do the things that I know I can do despite my ADHD.   This is not to say that the person I am without my medication is a bad person. They are the same person. My unmedicated self is not unlikeable and broken. I'm not obligated to be unmedicated or medicated to please other people; I'm medicated because it helps me function in this weird world where disabilities and mental illness are seldom taken into consideration or met with empathy.  It can be tough to love ourselves when we are overwhelmed, overstimulated, fighting impulsive or intrusive thoughts, or anything that ADHD makes us believe. Even more so when people we love don't make an effort to understand this.

People who were raised by animals in the wild. Wikipedia took me away and I kept reading one case after another. Finally came out of it and realized I am so dehydrated, my back hurts, i really have to pee, and I’m hungry.   I didn’t even mean to do it... and I have no idea what even triggered the thought that lead me there.   I don’t know why my hyperfocus can’t be triggered about things I ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT. Can people even control their hyperfocus or are we all merely slaves to its whims?   Lmao....happy Sunday, everyone. Hope you aren’t spending it down weird internet holes like me!

46ad4b8ec283d2b2722b5f9883a21c96e6a1516317b6efab45096d1c04be7737;;;Probably one of the hardest things about having ADHD is that sometimes I don't know how much blame to put on myself, and how much blame to put on my ADHD. You don't know where the line is.;;;edit: i used to take the "Blame everything on myself and ADHD is not an excuse and a cop out" approach in high school but i was beating myself up so much it was to the point where i was having suicidal thoughts because would hate myself so much. Now i know much more about ADHD and the affects it has on people and i began accepting myself a little bit more. But i i want to get anywhere i have to hold myself accountable, however i am afraid i will end up beating myself up again much like in high-school so im hesitant on how much do i hold myself or probably what is more correct how do i hold myself accountable without beating myself up. Because i don't want to put myself down over things i can't control.

I have just been thinking about all the people i used to be close friends with, ex partners who i spent years with and previous jobs and universities. And from all those I'm lucky to remember a single thing. I cant remember any conversations I've had. Feeling pretty down about it, i dont know whats caused it or how long I've had this because i think it's only recently that I've really started to think about what i can remember   Just for reference i turned 30 this year.

Ive been reading through your comments and it's reassuring to know I'm not the only one, also lots of great suggestions for getting better. I'm so glad i found this sub ❤️

I felt like I could have been more social and grown more as a person but I was hindered by something I didn't understand.  I felt like I went through so much growth as an individual and came to know myself and my ADHD all throughout my 20's.  Everything before that feels like a blur; wasted potential.  This is coming from someone who was diagnosed early and medicated. I just never realized how much ADHD affected my life until recently.  Is this a common feeling with ADHD?  EDIT: Wow! This really blew up! It seems this really resonates with everyone. I'll try to read as many as I can but I can't promise I can reply to everything (though I may read a few messages between work).  Thank you, and stay strong everyone!

06de7a9fb0a23f3cc7ed392a9cd77dc9641edfcb71ce802656c5efdaaf576125;;;Reminder: You definitely do have ADHD;;;Don’t listen to the people who don’t believe your diagnosis. Don’t even listen to yourself when you start to doubt it. “Mindfulness and meditation” may help but it is not a cure. Medication may help but it’s not a cure. Sometimes I start to think to myself “hm maybe I don’t actually have ADHD.” And then I’m late to work for 4 days in a row; despite waking up on time. And then I forget to clock out multiple days in the week; despite having worked here for years. And then I forget to do simple things like call my mom, or pay my rent, or I over-salt my eggs in the morning and think “oh yeah maybe I do have it.” It’s ok that you have ADHD but don’t forget that you have it. Don’t bully yourself into thinking you’re just lazy or not trying hard enough. If you found this sub I can almost guarantee that you have it.  Just a reminder in case any of you are feeling the way I’ve been feeling for the past few weeks.  *Edit:* Oof looks like the ADHD deniers have arrived😂
5abfbf1adfa21895c0b53abda27d7a4d9941aa9f354e3f4a4b95918615d63a2f;;;Sometimes it feels like covid lockdown was designed specifically to make my ADHD 10x worse.;;;Got my way through high school with undetected ADHD. The pressure of outside accountability, rigid structure, constant social stimulation, and tons of extracurriculars I was interested in helped me compensate a ton.  I had no clue just how much that was holding me together. Turns out my world was hanging by a thread. I completely fell apart during quarantine. No sleep schedule, no exercise, no socialization, constantly lonely and hyperfixating on my few online relationships, unable to work on my passions, stumbling into panic episodes and despair about what I'm going to do with my life, feeling like I didn't recognize myself. The covid world is terrible for ADHD brains. I can hardly think of a scenario worse for us. It sounds like something out of a sci-fi novel: complete lockdown of all interesting and stimulating activities, you can only do things on your computer in your room now. I had to quit uni last semester, got diagnosed two weeks ago. It's a relief in some ways, but also terrifying to know that my ability to function normally was dependent on factors entirely outside of my control.  Hoping others feel this way. Covid is a nightmare scenario for ADHD brains. I'm struggling to remember that the world used to feel interesting at all. Anyone else just hanging on by a few hyperfixations? Feeling like I'm really going to lose it if things don't improve this summer.
be2871deaac407f8e512faf4ecbdb518d8b5caa121128c32484d759b90fe85bf;;;*taps mic* IF YOU BEAT YOURSELF UP FOR NOT STICKING WITH HOBBIES OR GET DISCOURAGED ABOUT STARTING NEW ONES, READ THIS!;;;I read and responded to a post on this topic yesterday and OP from that post recommended that I make my comment a post of its own. After all the times I've been helped by this community, this finally feels like my opportunity to give back. Here goes! \*cracks knuckles\*  &#x200B;  So I've been struggling with this lately myself. I've been wanting to learn the guitar for literally years but never had the money to buy one. Now that I have the money to do it I keep getting cold feet and thinking, "Oh man, I know I'm not gonna be able to stick with it so it's not even worth buying." But f\*ck it. I'm gonna buy it! Here's how I came to that decision.  &#x200B;  **\*\*1. Be kind to yourself!\*\***  Obviously, #1 universal rule of ADHD, applicable to all scenarios. Self-loathing sucks. Do your best to be kind to yourself. I recently came across the term "self-compassion", which I really like. Be at least as nice to yourself as you'd be to other people. You wouldn't make fun of/beat up a loved one who switches hobbies often, so don't do it to yourself!  &#x200B;  **\*\*2. Emphasize dynamic hobbies.\*\***  Someone in yesterday's thread used the phrase "dynamic hobbies" and I think that's a god damn genius phrase. We need hobbies that we can pick up for a month or two at a time and completely forget for another few months. That's just how my/our hobbies work! We just need to accept that and choose compatible hobbies. Last month I got *obsessed* with freshwater aquariums. Watched a ton of YouTube videos, went to Petco to scout potential fish, etc. Even bought a fancy ass $100+ fish tank from Amazon! Then I realized that this is \*not\* a dynamic hobby. Forgetting/not caring about my aquarium for months will result in dead fish. **\*ERROR 404: INCOMPATIBLE HOBBY!\*** Fish tank was subsequently returned.  Relatedly, I had a plant in my bedroom that I needed to water every day or few days. That plant is dead as hell. I now have one of those plants that you only need to remember to water once a month (snake plant, if you're wondering!). Plant is thriving! Lol  As far as hobbies go, guitar is super dynamic! If I learn 3 songs this month and no songs for the next two months, no one dies!  &#x200B;  **\*\*3. Reset your expectations.\*\***  Listen, I know myself. I am not about to practice diligently every day for the next year and be performing at local bars in 2 years. That'd be great, but it's a pipe dream. If I define that as the goal, I'm going to fall short and feel shitty. Instead, I'm going to focus on being able to strum a couple songs here and there when I'm bored and maybe learn one song for my girlfriend that I can use to score some romantic brownie points on a birthday/anniversary. That's it. Anything else is icing on the cake. If I do actually end up learning guitar for real, awesome! If I don't, awesome! The point here is to add something to my life that brings me joy, and dammit, strumming along to a song with 4 basic chords from time to time gives me joy! Don't squeeze all the joy out of it by putting too many expectations on it or on yourself.  &#x200B;  **\*\* 4. Reduce the barriers to exit (specifically financially).\*\***  You've heard of "barriers to entry"? Well, allow me to introduce you to a new concept: barriers to exit. Super important. Recognize and accept that your new "hobby crush" may fade with time. When I get excited about a new hobby I am super tempted to buy professional-grade stuff. MISTAKE! When entering a new hobby, recognize that it may not last and make it as easy as possible to get out of financially -- meaning it won't be too much of a loss if (when) you give it up. When starting a new hobby that requires purchasing things, try to force yourself to only purchase entry level stuff until the hobby has stuck around for long enough to justify investing in. Or buy things that can easily be resold on the internet. Entry level DSLR camera that can be resold if you decide you hate photography? Fine. Professional grade DLSR camera engraved with your first and last name and therefore with limited resale value? Not fine. Not fine at all.  This month I started a new workout class. Went to the first class and loved it! Was ready to purchase the $200 month unlimited monthly membership for 12 months! Yay! Then a little voice said, "Hey man, remember to reduce the barriers to exit. You might not like this next month." So instead I bought the $50 entry-level package and will re-evaluate my commitment as I go. If it doesn't stick, it won't nearly be as much of a loss!  &#x200B;  **\*\* 5. Don't try harder, try differently!\*\***  Also a foundational ADHD rule. But relevant in literally every scenario...including this one! When it comes to a new hobby, you may need to outsource your executive function to a teacher or class (if you can afford it!). Example: I've had a regular gym membership for 6 months and literally only gone 1 single time. It's just too much to actually figure out what workouts I am supposed to be doing, keep myself accountable to the time set for each exercise, etc. Also tbh it's honestly kind of boring. I signed up for a workout class last week. The only thing I need to do is show up. They already have the exercises planned so I don't need to think about it. And it's a group class so there's constant motivation to push myself from peers. I have exercised 5 times in the last 7 days! That's like an infinity percent improvement from my previous strategy. I would never have gotten there if I was just trying "harder" at a strategy that didn't work for me.  &#x200B;  **\*\* 6. Trying new hobbies is a hobby unto itself!\*\***  What is the definition of a hobby? Something you do for fun. Some people collect stamps for fun. Other people watch birds for fun. Others make scrapbooks. You know what I do? TRY NEW HOBBIES! I get pleasure from getting excited about a random thing and diving into it a month at a time. Trying new hobbies is my hobby! No sense in feeling guilt or shame about it when it makes me so god damn happy!  This is a subtle but ***really important*** reframing. Person X would say, "I collect stamps for fun. Last year I found a rare limited edition 1956 stamp from Montana and a couple from California in the 1760s! I loved it!" I would say, "I try new hobbies for fun. Last year I dabbled in photography, guitar, and dog sitting! I loved it!" Both of us would be having fun doing what we do. Person X would never feel bad about him or herself for not trying "enough" new things, so why would I ever feel bad about trying "too many" new things?!  &#x200B;  **\*\*TL;DR:\*\*** Be kind to yourself. Accept that your hobbies will have to be dynamic. Instead of trying harder, consider trying differently. Reduce the (financial) barriers to exit. And, most importantly, recognize that trying new hobbies \*is\* a hobby! Godspeed, mateys. Happy hobbying!  EDIT1: Several of you have appreciated the "dynamic hobbies" concept so I went back to track down exactly where I first heard it. Credit goes to /u/Carlulua! :D  EDIT2: Holy smokes! Silver and gold! Deep gratitude to all of you! Like I said above, my greatest reward is feeling like I've given back to people who've given me SO much. <3  EDIT3: Platinum?!?!1 I didn't even know that existed! 😂 Jokes aside, to everyone that's expressed their thanks I want to thank YOU. I spend some part of literally every single day hating how my brain works (or doesn't) and wondering whether I'll ever have anything of value to offer the world. Today you all helped me feel like something I did was meaningful, and that means more than I can say. Eternal love to you all!

ebb5c78e3b6bd527e4fab39e56e47532dc12f0c4cc656cef4db29eabc794069b;;;If it was REALLY important you would have remembered;;;I hate when people say that to me, “if it was really important you would have remembered” like ummm my brain basically does the opposite, like I remember unimportant things and forget all the important things lol.   Also, I always thought that that phrase was kind of a joke? Because you can’t choose whether or not you remember something right? But I guess it isn’t always a joke.. my S/O is basically the definition of “perfect executive function” so we have both had to learn how to adjust. I didn’t realize it actually made him upset if I forgot things, because he really thought that it must not have been important to me. He didn’t realize either that’s it’s not as easy as “just doing it” or “just remembering” things. That’s so crazy to me, it’s been a learning process for both of us haha.  Edit: omg thank you for the awards!! I wasn’t expecting this to get so much attention!! Im excited to read through all the comments :D
7fa449b26431046bab7f2281d47730f38202d762897ef4ce0cd9ed37c47af587;;;The painful cycle of initially charming people but eventually just disappointing them...;;;1. People are often attracted to your openness and unintentional zaniness at first  2. They quickly get annoyed and confused with your impulsiveness and lack of conscientiousness.   3. They (usually) accept your idiosyncrasies and realise you’re actually smart, interesting and refreshing.   4. Eventually the frustration mounts up and (whilst they may still like you as a person) the relationship slowly but inevitably begins to die.   Sometimes there’s a happy ending but oftentimes there isn’t.  Sound familiar?  Here’s a case study with my manager;   During the interview he acted as though I was a breath of fresh air - I like to think I genuinely am sometimes - my random tangential responses made me appear more relaxed and interesting and he hired me on the spot in fact.  Then over the next few weeks the cracks began to emerge and I’d make frustrating mistakes in processes he had already run my through several times, forget crucial details, leave customers on hold for hours, forget things he told me etc and he began to get annoyed and frustrated.  Then over the next few months when we formed a slightly more personal bond I was able to disclose My ADHD and you know explained the atavistic survival advantages if we were a tribe I would be keeping his ass alive and random other factoids and shit - he became aware that I’m actually the smarter person in the building in a more abstract sense and would run ideas and theories and things past me and even asked me for some personal advice. I excelled at building rapport with people but my lack of attentiveness remained as my crown of thorns.   ... but 6 months or so in the frustrations around my immutable lack of attention to detail and tardiness and the fallout of that has just started becoming intolerable for him, and he basically just told me that he thinks I have lots of positive qualities but the job isn’t really for me ( he’s not wrong) and he doesn’t have time to be mopping up my mess.  So I told him I’m in the process of finding other work (I am and have been for a while) and he expressed that we should still catch up over a drink every now and then. Even though I know part of him means it I know that we never will.   //  This is actually the usual concatenation of unfortunate events with friendships and even romantic relationships too. “I like (or maybe even love) you but I’ve got to let you go for the sake of my own psyche” is sort of the vibe I often get.  Or my lack of clear communication is interpreted as lack of effort and the relationship collapses.  I know I possess all the qualities people have pointed out in me, I know my intentions are pure and I’m trying to try but I can’t help but feel like shit knowing that In most cases I’ll end up disappointing people and it’s not a matter of it but when.   It can make it hard to believe that you’re a truly worthwhile person.  But we must believe it, even if the whole world seems to turn its back on us.   We must recognise our own intrinsic value.   We’re trying to succeed in a society that isn’t built for our success.  We’re trying.    ———————————————————————-  Edit:  Also worth noting that my craving for novel stimulation definitely results in a significant drop in attention and investment at work and in personal relationships - so it’s likely that my effort and performance in these areas does decrease and it’s not just a matter of withering peoples patience and tolerance.  (Losing a job is bad but seeing a personal relationship disintegrate because of this is crushing)   I’m sure most of us can relate to this as well.  ——————————————————————-  Edit 2: I know this post walks the line between self pity, catharsis and self compassion, but it really wasn’t intended to come out as bleak as it did.  So here’s an addendum:  We must be kind to ourselves, but that doesn’t entail wallowing in despair. We can and should strive to improve our areas of deficiency whether that’s through medication, behavioural therapy and modification, mindset shifts, environmental changes etc.  I always tell myself that even if the chances of reaching my elusive “potential” is 1/10000000000, is that not still worth trying for?  Most of all remember that we aren’t bad people regardless of how our actions might be misinterpreted at times. We have a mental disorder. We aren’t deliberately trying to hurt or disappoint anybody. We aren’t useless or inept or braindead or lazy. As long as we are trying we are worthy of living a good life like anybody else.

7aa43f783680ce8014f8a6a669ed70b6b5a18e019af3a74f7d0d990999bad00a;;;I hate how people invalidate your ADHD if you're not acting "hyper".;;;I've struggled with ADHD and bipolar my whole life. Recently I went through a horrible depressive episode and wasnt acting "hyper" and my friends had told me they didn't think I was acting like I had ADHD.  It was hard to hear that. I mean are you supposed to be hyper and jumping around all the time, especially if your going through a depressive episode. No a lot of us struggle with adult/teen ADHD and still act hyper but we dont act hyper all the time.  Trust me I know that we can look erratic at times explaining a hyperfixation or ranting on a random subject, or our brains can be going a mile a minute and that most of the time is very visible.  But you dont need to act hyper to have ADHD, especially if you struggle with depression which can often go hand in hand with ADHD.  Anyways I hope everyone on this subreddit knows that they are valid even when not acting "hyper. Thank you for being an awesome community.

Including a full routine of getting ready. Hair, face and beard washed, moisturized, put on deodorant, done my hair, put on clean clothes, and cleaning up my mess! I also ate the same regime of food in the morning for 4 days before my adderal kicks in and I lose my appetite. I've come home and stayed active doing chores, getting dinner ready, cleaning as I go, and cleaning up the house entirely when the children are in bed. I EVEN DID FULL LOADS OF MY LAUNDRY!!!!! Washed, dried, folded, and put away. I even avoided my usual distractions. Kept video games to a limited time, turned the tv off when it was time for bed and was head down, eyes closed before 1130 every night.   Wildly successful week on that end!!!!!!!!  Edit: Only on this thread do I appreciate, and count my self lucky to be among, a bunch of disorganized freaks. We are what anyone may consider to be freaks. After all, we are actually different in many ways. It's not just a chemical imbalance for us... We have different brains. We literally have to try and take our brains, and incorporate the functions of NT's to function properly.   I read a book recently that called the ADHD mind a hunters mind. And the mind of NT's a Farmer's mind. We have a brain that was suitable to be a hunter gatherer millenia ago, but not for the farmers world of today full of distraction and menial, down right boring, tasks that make loves function.   I'm just so glad that I have this place to share my success and get such a fantastic response! My friends, peers, and family literally cannot truly appreciate this success as anything significant, because they can't even fathom the effort it takes to work against your own biology. You guys are all fantastic! Thank you!  This is a comment I made down below. It dawned on me that it may be a good edit to show my appreciation for all of the support and praise I have recieved. You have truly bolstered me to keep on going.... Only I've now spent a large majority of my night reading and responding to all you lovely people, and not enough time doing human things! Thank you for a well deserved reward for all my hard work!!! Thank you, that k you, thank you!

I (33M) have an ADHD assessment coming up looking for diagnosis.  She said, entirely non-maliciously, "I don't think you have ADHD. I think you just have problems focusing on what you're doing, you zone out all the time whilst I'm talking to you, you don't finish things because you get distracted by something else, and you need constantly reminding to do things even if they're important, and you always leave things to the last minute..." and I was just standing there nodding like "uh huh".  Part of me is worrying that I'm seeking diagnosis as an excuse for being lazy, disorganized, and unmotivated. It was reassuring to hear that someone who lives me thinks I have all the hallmarks, even if the point she ended up making was not the one she meant to.  I thought it was funny, at least

She's a lot like me.  As we were leaving for school, we went through her schoolbag checklist.  "Homework?"  "Yep."  "Lunch?"  "Got it"  "Piano Books?"  "Oh, I forgot, they're in my room!"  Her piano books are a big issue. She has lessons at school once a week and often forgets them.  We get to school and I drop her off only to realise that I have lost my wallet. Crap. I've left it at my friend on the other side of town's house. So I head over to his house. Soon as I arrive, I get a call from school.  "Your daughter has forgot her lunch."  HOW?!?! It was in her bag. I saw it!  Oh well, I chat with my friend for a couple of minutes and then head back to pick up her lunchbox and...the phone rings. It's the school wondering where I am. IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME! I wasted the whole morning with my friend! I grab the lunchbox (it was under a pile of books) and head to the school.  She gets her lunch ten minutes late and every is fine.  I've just walked in the door and sitting in front of me on the kitchen table is the "pile of books" her lunch was under.  It's her piano books.  I need a drink.  **I'm making this a success because we solved the problem (mostly) and didn't panic. We've got each others backs and that's a win in my (piano) book.**  Edit: To clarify to those suggesting we have a checklist at the door, this WAS the checklist. She sat there with her bag, looked in and SAW the items she needed. Somehow, the book and the lunchbox got out of her bag.

The health insurance covered the costs, and I can't afford a regular private psychiatrist.   She asked what my GPA was. I told her. I mentioned I used to be called "gifted". I told her about all my symptoms and difficulties since I was a child.  She said gifted children don't have ADHD. She said no ADHD person can be an engineering student. She said that "now people hear those things from the USA and they think they know what they're talking about". She said she wouldn't change her mind. She asked who was the first person to consider the possibility. I answered "myself". She replied "yeah, I figured", to which I said "but three psychiatrists have confirmed it". She said they must have no idea what they're talking about. I left.  I am devastated. The reason I wasn't diagnosed sooner is because my grades were great. Now they're not, and apart from them, my life is a mess. I need help. She was my last chance.  Edit: thank you so much for the awards!!  Edit 2: since some people are asking, the other three people that diagnosed me were 1) a psychologist (sorry about the mistake). I'm currently going there and she's awesome, but we only ever talk about how I feel about ADHD, it's not hands on practical advice 2) an amazing psychiatrist which told me it was obvious I had it, but it's too expensive for me to go back there 3) another psychiatrist who told me that since elvanse made me feel awful (it helped A LOT with ADHD symptoms but I didn't sleep or eat for days) she couldn't do anything else and advised me to "get used to it". This was the college's psychiatrist.

But then I still forget to watch/listen for that thing and I have to rewind again. I don't get this! What is my brain even doing after I rewind? I have zero drive to listen for that thing despite just rewinding. I have sometimes rewinded up to 4 times. I end up concluding that it was just not engaging enough for me to figure out what happened there. I actually want to know what happened, but the lead up didn't contain enough that interested me.  This is especially awkward when watching a movie with others. Was rewatching Breaking Bad with my husband last night. So this is a show I've already seen but I remember like nothing! Something important happened, but as usual, I forgot to watch TV while WATCHING TV!! So I ask my husband to rewind. Whoops, forgot to watch AGAIN. Rewind again. Forgot to watch. I pretend I didn't understand what happened and need to see it again when really I just forgot to watch again. One more time. Yup. No idea what happened, didn't watch it. I now have to pretend I saw what happened because nobody without ADHD would even believe this.  I listen to the news all the time too. My husband will listen while doing 5 other things and say "wow, that's shocking!" and I am like "what is?" and he's like...what they just said on the news! Oh....wasn't listening....  Edit: oh ya and never mind that breaking bad is a tv show and not even a movie lol

Not because we ever fall out or anything I just don't text back and don't make an effort to hang out often enough so we end up drifting. If I don't see someone regularly like through work or college or through my partner then I cannot maintain a friendship. The last few years my only friends have been those of my partners and as soon as I break up with someone I never see their friends again because I can't make an effort to maintain things.  I want friends so bad but its so hard for me, even if get the impulse to text a friend, once they text back a few times my interest has twinddled and I leave them on read or don't even open it and I feel so bad because I know I'm being a shitty friend.  If I make plans to hang out with someone by the time it comes around I don't wanna go out and I cancel.  Does anyone else do this?
5abca08993e069305b5d3d7165ccaae538d5d291b3bd2d160afd00a964f72464;;;On transgender and LGBTQIA+ acceptance;;;(and broadly, acceptance of experiences outside the western cis het white abled male expectation)  I can't believe I have to actually say this.  Lately we've been seeing an increase in people talking about their experiences as trans, nonbinary, gay, lesbian, ace, aro, or otherwise queer.  This is wonderful and we love to see people finding a community here!  For the most part, y'all are very incredibly accepting and that's why people keep coming here.  As expected though, we've also seen a rise in assholes who can't extend basic respect to people.  A recently deleted (by OP) post had many references to OP's partner using singular they/them pronouns.  OP clarified that this was primarily due to anonymity (and this too is a 100% legitimate usage of singular they/them) but that did not stop people from getting downright *hostile* about the simple usage of they/them to refer to a singular person.  As part of this they spread hate about transgender and specifically nonbinary people.  Bans were extended.  In the English language, singular they/them has existed for hundreds of years.  You're long overdue on catching up.  Other threads have people explicitly identifying themselves and people reacting only to that instead of what the post was actually about.  We do not tolerate any kind of hate against a person for who they are.  We try to have discussions and see if the person is just unaware, but we also do not exist to educate people about queerness.  Bans are given on sight for especially egregious assholery and if a person doubles down on their ignorance.  This is a safe space for people of any gender, sexuality, color, nationality, disability, etc.  Unfortunately we do miss some comments, so we really appreciate when the *report* button is used to bring these to our attention.  The /r/ADHD mod team is diverse.  The /r/ADHD community is diverse.  We will work to protect this and keep people feeling safe here.  We did not choose to be these ways, but *you* have the choice to hate or to accept and there is absolutely a wrong choice.  To summarize: Gay and trans and queer people have existed for the entirety of our species.  /r/ADHD will **not** tolerate any phobia or hate or questioning of people, their pronouns, or their experiences.  Other bannable offenses: racism, sexism, ableism, spreading fear and hate.  This list is not exhaustive.   Thank you all for the love and support you give to each other💕
a89691d5ec285d7f33e6971643ec55d4c774bbeb732b44a6c5f557968c5c5a0a;;;*Pulls out phone to check the time, stares at the screen for a few seconds, puts phone back in pocket.* “Wait, what time is it?”;;;Half the time I do this I don’t even have anything else distracting me, I just somehow forget to actually consider what time it is and why I’m checking it.  Edit: I’ve had a few people mention how *everyone* experiences this, not just people with ADHD. I’m absolutely aware of this. The thing is, everybody experiences ADHD symptoms to some degree. The difference is that many neurotypical people experience them every once in a while; not everyday, multiple times a day.   I’ve been keeping up on reading as many comments as I can, and I’ve read a bunch from people saying how validating this thread is, knowing that they’re not the only ones who struggle with things like this. That shit absolutely warms my heart, and I think that’s what this sub should be for. I’m sure plenty of the things us ADHDers struggle with aren’t entirely exclusive to just us, but that’s why it makes it so much goddamn harder. Because as much as people may understand some of the challenges we face, they think we should be able to deal with them just as easily as everyone else.
a19ef5b1ce9fbe2bff11b3139ffc26328c1f2605f5b365fd38d0681145add9d0;;;Ableism in textbooks;;;Hi y’all,   I wanted to share with you all a bit of a breakthrough I had today that I’m hoping encourages the rest of you as much as it is me.   First, the bad news. There was a LOT of awful ableism in my textbook. Part of this post will contain examples, but it’s not the whole post and I hope you will scroll past those examples if they cause you anxiety and skip to the end.   I’m in a psychology class right now called lifespan development. Last night I had to read a chapter in which adhd was addressed at length. I can honestly say it was some of the most harmful things I’ve read in a textbook about this sort of thing, and it just hurt. I hurt for myself, and for the larger community. Contained within the chapter were points made from outdated sources, pseudoscience, stereotypes, generalizations, and horrifically overstated claims. They said (and I quote) “children with adhd are burdens to teachers and parents”. They also literally only addressed boys / children who are boys. There’s zero mentions of adulthood adhd, nor of adhd in folks who aren’t little boys.   They also claimed that we are over diagnosed to an extreme - like practically 90% of the time.   They claimed that ALL people over the age of 8 or so fabricate symptoms to get an adhd diagnosis so they can fuel an addiction. They mention the addiction thing a lot.   They also mentioned that mothers and female teachers are biased against little boys and therefore pathologize normal young male behaviors out of a place of hate/ignorance.  I can go on, but I think you get the point. It claimed to represent “both sides” of the “argument” meanwhile they literally did no such thing and made sweeping generalizations that are harmful.    I talked to my boyfriend about it, and I told him a part of me felt I should say something to my professor but I was anxious/didn’t know if I was overreacting.   He encouraged me to do it, and I did, despite the lightweight panic attack I had to fight.     This morning, I got replies.  She expressed overwhelming support for our community, and made it very clear that her and I are absolutely on the same page. She went further to note why she felt I was correct and how wrong it all was. She went on to suggest that she help me take this to the publishers/authors of the textbook to make an even bigger impact.   She then said she was going to make a new module for the class to address adhd, pseudoscience, ableism against adhd, etc and share resources so that the whole class becomes better educated and aware. She asked if I’d be willing to look at her ideas and sources and be a sounding board for her, I said yes.  This is not a “good for me” post. This is was a victory against myself and my anxiety - yes. But more than that I did this for all of you. I did this because of how much love and respect I have for our community. I hope this brightens your day.   {EDIT} : Several people have asked me for the title of the textbook. Here’s the truth as to why I did not immediately provide it at first : classic “overwhelm” lol. I was in a sh*t storm of homework and getting more likes and comments than I ever anticipated / have ever received (ABSOLUTELY NOT A COMPLAINT I HAVE SO MUCH GRATITUDE AND LOVE FOR ALL OF YOU) I was just getting super sensory overloaded on top of being with a friend at the time who was playing insanely loud video games and trying to talk to me. So a very simple request was not followed through with in as timely of a manner as I should have - I apologize. This apparently created suspicion so I want to clear that up if I can. Here’s the information for the textbook.   Berger, K. (2019). LaunchPad for Invitation to the Life Span (Six Months Access) (4th ed.). Macmillan. [ISBN 9781319211394]   My professor and I have had a really hard time figuring out how to move forward since she could only find this person on LinkedIn, but I’m going to create an account and try that method (I’ve never used that site before) and see what happens. I looked into this author and I have yet to see any red flags, which is odd to me considering how harmful this was.   A huge thank you to all of you who have been so incredibly kind and supportive of me. I literally did not expect anyone to even read this if I’m being honest, and I was nervous to post it - hence it not being entirely articulate. But your overwhelming (in the best way) love and support has already brought me so much healing and acceptance within myself. I wish the best for each and every one of you. Thank you for sharing your hearts and stories with me. I’m proud to be a part of this community, because of all of you in large part. I did this for all of you. You deserve someone to at least attempt to fight for you.
571dcd2b8ce6d67e53b69664eb23332ae95beaee0d1d1cf485d4b2ccf0a36136;;;This sub is the reason I fought for my mental health - In less than 3 months I became a 4.0 student and got back into my hobbies;;;**EDIT:** Reading everyone's comments that I inspired them to not give up makes me so happy!! I did not expect this post to get so big and I'm extremely grateful for all of the amazing positive feedback! I just want to add that I am NOT advocating for relying 100% on medication and I do still have to put in the work to stay focused and not lose hours of my day. I still have many symptoms of ADHD that I can only control on my own! I am very safe with my medication and try to take an off-day twice a week. As for those still struggling, I'm here for you and hope you get the help you need soon! This was not to rub it in ANYONE'S face but to share my story!!!  For 23 years I was told by psych after psych that ADHD and social anxiety was not a good enough diagnosis in itself, and that I must have something else along with it. I live in a pretty conservative pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps area of the US and was told to exercise, focus, and maybe try meditation or yoga. I was always offered a prescription for Strattera and mood stabilizers with no other options - just take it or leave it. Even bringing up the possibility of trying a stimulant would cause an eyeroll from doctors.  At the time I found this sub, I was ready to give up. I remember crying my eyes out because of all the posts about seeing people doing so much better after trying medication, and wishing that a doctor would allow me to have that chance. The people here motivated me to keep trying and not give up on finding the right care team who would not only help me find medication, but also listen to me.  Every doctor in this area, and even my own family, SWORE that I could not have ADHD. For the dumbest reasons, too:  "You're too smart"  "You're too young to be on stimulants"  "...hyperactivity? You sleep all day!"  "The ADHD is caused by bipolar disorder. Adults don't have ADHD alone"  "I can't give you a stimulant because you could lose too much weight" (I'm obese though? lol)  and many more...  I didn't give up though. I knew the mood stabilizers and SSRIs were not doing anything. And Strattera was essentially a sugar pill to me. I jumped from doctor to doctor. Each one of them agreeing that I had symptoms of ADHD but insisting that I was bipolar.  I started speaking up for myself. I started reading everything I could about mental health. I was firm in telling them that I did not believe I had bipolar disorder and it made no sense considering I don't have an issue with depression or mania. I started refusing the Strattera, with one doctor even telling me that it could take OVER A YEAR for Strattera to kick in when it still wasn't working after 8 months.  Finally, it happened. I went to a new doctor. She almost laughed at the fact that I kept being diagnosed as bipolar with no real signs of it. She was SHOOK at the fact that none of these doctors offered any other medication for ADHD and that my anxiety was ignored. She prescribed me Vyvanse that day and asked me to come back in two weeks.  My life changed that day. When I first went into her office I was failing school, unable to work, obese, unable to remember anything, all tasks being difficult to complete, picking my skin, constantly being tired, and maladaptive daydreaming for hours a day.  **What happened after medication:**  That Vyvanse, along with finding a care team that listens to me, **got me my first 4.0 ever this past** **semester**, despite COVID switching all my classes to online. It made me to **start eating healthy again**. It made me **enjoy decorating my home and keeping it clean**. It made me enjoy **working out**. It made me wake up **feeling refreshed in the morning**. It made me **realize I'm a fantastic** **programmer**. It got me **back into playing music and video games**. It got me a **cyber security internship**. It helped me **remember to reply to my friends and family, which has strengthened our connection.** Oh, and I **stopped picking my skin for the first time since I was 6 years old!!**  The other who doctors didn't listen to me or didn't "believe" in ADHD told me I would get addicted to meth, become underweight, and have terrible reactions to stimulants without taking mood stabilizers or anti-psychotics. They refused to look at my ADHD as a valid diagnosis alone.  **Basically, what I'm saying is to please not give up**. **If you are from a close-minded town, have a family who doesn't take you seriously, or your doctor refuses to try other forms of treatment, there is still a way for you to overcome these obstacles. Stay strong. Pay attention to how YOU feel. Be an advocate for yourself.**  I struggled with these things for years and while it hasn't fixed all my issues (social anxiety is still p bad) it has helped change me into the human I wanted to be. And I'm not even done yet.  **Do not give up. I am cheering for you! <3**

You can think of success in life like a club we're all trying to get into. Most people will go in the front door. They stand in line, wait their turn, and work their way forward slowly but surely. A select number of exclusive people get to use the back door, the are the people who know the right person, have the right reputation, or could buy their way in. But some people can't get in through the front or the back door, they need "the third door"  The third door is the unmarked way in. It's a window, a fire escape, a roof exit. It's hiding in the laundry cart when they bring in the linens or disguising yourself and going in the service entrance. It's a combination of timing, ingenuity, and effort, but you can keep trying until you make it in.   I often need to remind myself that my route to success is different, but that doesn't make it any less real. The whole concept of "run your own race" has been reiterated to me so many times but I find it hard to stop comparing my path to others. I have to remind myself: just keep trying things, never stop innovating ways around your problems, fall down nine times and stand up ten. I think I feel my best when I'm in "lovable rogue" mode, because I know I don't feel good (at all!!!) when I'm in "trying to be normal" mode.   Find your third door, people.   And remember, if you get into "the club" - you aren't a fraud, you deserve to be there just as much as anybody else.  EDIT: Holy moly this resonated! Please everybody keep sharing your stories and experiences. Maybe we all need to see/remember the breadth of possibility that's truly out there.  EDIT: Thank you /u/23wings for the original source! It's a book, Third Door by Alex Banayan.
deb50cf1b767228477baf23225341207aba5bb7c6fcb7bfb17ec04fe4793db8f;;;"Oh yea, I just focus";;;So i was talking with a friend and the topic of ADHD got brought up. I told her about some struggles and she was like "yea I used to have ADHD as well" and I was like "seriously? how did you get over it?" and she literally said "I just focus, it's not that hard"   bruh
19912170398a0d16f98ade4db1d53328421a98ac7081021fcdd7048389fd85e1;;;Trying to explain ADHD to someone that doesn't have it is impossible.;;;Every struggle that we have can be a shared experience to almost anyone that doesn't have the disorder. Short term memory, procrastination, forgetfullness, impulsivity, distractability, racing thoughts, brain fog, RSD, insomnia, mental fatigue, zoning out, anxiety, guilt, shame, rambling, time blindness, interrupting, low self-esteem, depression, starting but not finishing, to name a few.  The problem is trying to explain to people that our intentions do not match these struggles. I didn't intend on waiting until the last minute to start a task. I didn't intend on being late. I didn't intend on misplacing my keys. I didn't intend on forgetting about the meeting today. I didn't intend to spend an hour making a sandwich. I didn't intend on not responding to your text for 3 monthd.  It literally haunts our *every* action and thought. We believe ourselves to be broken individuals because of the confliction between how our mind operates vs how the world around us operates.  Our disorder is downplayed because of the frequency of our struggles in *other people's* lives. A one-off moment in your life is my entire day. "I misplaced my keys and showed up 15 mins late this morning, must have been an A-D-D moment" is just like saying "my leg fell asleep today for 10 mins, must have been a paraplegic moment."   **It is incredibly insulting to mock a serious disorder because the symptoms are universal.**  Don't feel bad because others are ignorant and choose to be so. You are so much more than your disorder. You are a fish that is expected to climb a tree. Fuck that, swim your ass off. Be exactly who you are, everyone else is taken. You aren't broken, others are incredibly insensitive. Zone out the haters and doubters.  Do yourself a favor. Surround yourself with people that accept you for who you are, not for who they expect you to be. You are so awesome for making it this far in a world not made for you. You are stronger than you have ever been told. Learn to love, laugh at, and forgive yourself. You have what it takes. You can do this. I believe in you.  Thanks for reading this. Have a shameless day, friend!

If I call myself dumb, it isn't a reflection on my self-esteem (at least for me it isn't). 8 times out of 10 it's probably me coping in the moment and the other 2 it's just to get people off my back when I'm being forgetful.   Edit: I am aware and fully agree that using the word "stupid" even in reference to myself is destructive and I am definitely a lot better about it than I was even a year ago.
878bcd2e20aed1437d71b071aef36bca606d967bb13eeb904e78968777241dd7;;;I asked for an accomodation for myself at work today and my neurotypical co-workers thanked me for it.;;;So I was one of four people chosen for a new position at work. It involves three weeks of training on how to use programs we need for our new job, and we're doing it over Microsoft Teams. I have three screens set up; one has the program I'm learning, one has the Teams meeting up so that I can see the screen that's being shared, and one is for notes. There's a test at the end of the 3 weeks.  &#x200B;  Since Monday I've been doing this: Copying that day's objectives into One Note, following along with the instructor on the program, and jotting down some notes whenever the instructor paused because there was a loading screen.   But wait, I just realized the instructor's talking again and he's on a different screen now and I don't know what we're doing because I was taking notes.  Ok, I found the screen he's on and I'm following along but I don't know what objective we're working on. I don't have time to take notes because I need to follow along so I can try to figure out what we're doing.  Ok, he just said the thing he was showing wasn't important for the test. Going to try to write some notes on the thing I just kind of worked through and hope they're right. Wait, I'm reading the objectives and two of them are about the thing he was talking about, but I wasn't listening. I thought he said it wasn't important! Maybe just the first thing he said wasn't important... Oh! The program just crashed and I have to reload it.  Ok, I'm missing half the notes and I'm not even remotely on the right screen of the program. I'm going to stop trying to follow along and just listen. Then I'll just write down what I remember in my notes at break time. When's break time again? Oh, in two and a half hours. Great.  &#x200B;  Then today we were reviewing what we learned yesterday and while I was frantically trying to fill in my notes, the instructor moved on to today's lesson. At the end of 3 hours I had written absolutely no notes on that session's material.   When we got back from break the instructor went to start the next lesson and I said, "Before we get started, I'm actually having a hard time following along with all of the material. I feel like I get parts of it, but sometime's I'll catch the middle and end and not understand how we got there. Or I'll do something fine but not understand which objective it is, so if I was asked to perform that objective I wouldn't know what I was being asked to demonstrate. Do you think it would be possible to, instead of teaching all of the objectives and then reviewing them at the end, we could do one or two objectives all the way through and then have maybe 10 minutes for you to summarize it and for us to take notes and ask questions before we move on to the next one?"  And he was just like, "Oh, definitely! No problem. Let's just start over from the first objective from today." It was literally that easy, and I went from thinking "What in the fuck was all of that?" to "To perform task X, do this, this, and that. Don't do this. Boom, got it." At our next break my co-workers were like, "Wow, that was much better! I wish we were learning it like that all along! I felt so dumb always coming in and asking to review everything from the day before."

On the other side, ADHD fucking sucks and I can see someone with ADHD making that claim to feel a bit better about this awful curse.  It's true that some of us are able to think in different and creative ways that can work out well for us in certain jobs or projects. What many NT people don't understand is that these ways of thinking are advanced coping mechanisms for some really debilitating core issues.  I know you fuckers love a good analogy so here's some equivalent "super powers" to help people understand ADHD.  -Having absolutely incredible balance...because you only have one leg.  -Being great at fixing things...because everything you own is broken.   -Having a really high pain tolerance...because you've always had a crippling headache.   -The ability function for days without resting...because you have nightmares every time you sleep.  -Being able to run faster than anyone else...because you're constantly being ambushed by wolves.  -Feeling hot no matter how cold it is...because you're on fire.  -Having great night vision...because you've never seen daylight.  Anyone else feel like this?

I made a complaint online, and the owner responded within five minutes, saying he'd be talking to his pharmacists about it today. Thanks for encouraging me, and for listening!!!   Yes, you bitch, there is. I'm on it because, without it, I feel so emotionally out of control. Without it, I feel stressed and panicky because I am so extremely forgetful. I'm not a safe driver unmedicated. I don't remember how to do my job unmedicated. I can't function unmedicated.  How dare you comment on it. I'm trying so hard right now. My nana might be dying as we speak, my job involves so many people and so much thinking and organization and stress, my house is a travesty that I'm trying to undo, my boyfriend and I are fighting--and my puppy broke open my pill bottle with my last two pills in it, two days before my refill appointment (today). (Luckily, I did the math, and she had ingested FAR below the amount where it would do any harm to her. And I'm absolutely putting them in a locked cupboard now--she had never showed signs of interest in them before, and I hadn't realized she was gall enough to reach all the way to the back of the bathroom counter.)   I am trying so hard. Fuck you for making that comment. I don't care if you didn't realize I was still in the pharmacy when you said it (I had stopped to look at toothpaste while waiting for them to get my pills ready). I cried for five minutes in the parking lot because of you. I'm hurt and angry and I hate that I'm angry. I hate that I feel this way. I need to not let shit like that get to me, but it does and I can't control it.   I'm so, so glad I'm starting therapy next week.  Thank you for listening to me rant. Love you guys.

2cead45b4b3f67fba8c495fa7d5e0ab8f16b1eb1fc5bd1a826a806ff71f1fa77;;;Keeping in touch with people I don’t see or talk to everyday is excruciatingly difficult when I am not on my meds. And I wish people didn’t get so offended by it.;;;So I’m pregnant, ADHD. No meds atm because of the pregnancy and I’m finding it verrry hard to socialize and keep in touch with everyone. Specifically long distance friendships/family and people I don’t talk to daily. People really come out of the woodwork when you’re pregnant too! Like old co-workers, my sisters friends, old neighbors even! I will just find it too much of a task to answer the check-up texts of “hey!! How are you doing momma?”   I began with giving delayed responses that were short and polite, to just not texting back. When I don’t text back I get them saying they’re worried about me and one lady actually showed up at my house! Another friend contacted my mom through Facebook asking am I okay because she hasn’t heard from me. I am fine!  And then you get the people that are offended and say something along the lines of -sorry I’m “overwhelming” or “bothering” you.  I talk with my husband and I have two close friends I text all the time that require minimal effort. I’m Also very close with my mom we talk every day. But it’s these long term, long distant friends that I find takes way too much effort to keep in touch with them all! It’s so frustrating because they actually get mad at me for it! Then I get mad at them but I don’t think they understand the effort and anxiety it takes for me to keep everybody updated and in the loop nor do I have a huge desire to. I never completely understood the social effects of ADHD but I assume that is what I am experiencing.   I feel keeping in touch with people was so much easier and enjoyable when I was on meds.

Women with ADHD are 8x more likely to attempt suicide, while men with ADHD are 4.5x more likely; parental violence and substance dependence increase the prevalence of suicide attempts.;;;[https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-12/uot-oif121520.php](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-12/uot-oif121520.php)  I’ve included some paragraphs I found interesting below.   University of Toronto  Manuscript DOI: 10.1080/13811118.2020.1856258  A nationally representative Canadian study reported that the lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts was much higher for women who had ADHD (24%) compared to women who had not (3%). Men with ADHD were also more likely to have attempted suicide compared to men without ADHD (9% vs. 2%)  Because ADHD is more common among men than among women, little research or clinical attention has focused on women with the disorder. In this study, women with ADHD had more than twice the odds of suicide attempts compared to men with ADHD.  Adults with ADHD who had been exposed to chronic parental domestic violence had triple the odds of suicide attempts compared to their peers with ADHD who had not experienced that childhood adversity. Parental domestic violence was defined as "chronic" if it had occurred more than 10 times before the respondent was age 16.  “We speculate that violent parental conflict may cause extreme stress for the child with ADHD and predispose these individuals to mental illness and suicidal thoughts. In addition, the challenges of raising a child with ADHD who is struggling with severe mental health issues may cause parental conflict, which may escalate into domestic violence."  The study examined a nationally representative sample of 21,744 Canadians, of whom 529 reported they had been diagnosed with ADHD. Data were drawn from the Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health.

We'd finally have time to get into all those hobbies we bought stuff for. We'd live long enough to come full circle on everything we started and ACTUALLY COMPLETE THINGS.

It felt really nice to feel heard.;;;My (27f) boyfriend (30m) has always been more skeptical about ADHD, especially about medicating for it. When I first was going to get the diagnosis, he said, "I think if it was me, I'd just ignore it because it doesn't seem like that big of a deal." Obviously, this was really frustrating. But I talked with him about how this is really important for me to feel supported in, and he agreed, and he has started reading up about it and has been really curious about what my experience is like.  He's also supporting my decision to pursue medication which is good too.
243f4da8fed69b79d429e6eba82b20fc18232c717f2eadad3f0073d7acd9ad1b;;;I went on a drug holiday and realised I can never go back;;;My psychiatrist, the one who diagnosed me with inattentive adhd, suggested every month or so I take a drug holiday. The means I take a weekend without taking any dexies to make sure it’s still working. I lasted until about 11am before taking my medication. I couldn’t stand it anymore.    At first, I thought i was having withdrawals. I was tired, withdrawn, unable to think about anything. I had been looking forward to having the day to myself to play video games and rather than playing video games, I just sat on the couch. Eventually, it hit me. I wasn’t having withdrawals. This is how I was. This is me unmedicated. This is how I loved the first 29 years of my life.    I never want to feel like that again. Sorry doc, drug holidays aren’t going to work for me. Being a functioning human being just feels too good.    Edit: I had no idea so many people would end up reading this. That’s why I haven’t responded very much! But the variety of responses had made one thing clear to me: I, and everyone else on medication for their ADHD, needs to do what’s best for them. I think I’ll experiment a bit from here, as many have said a drug holiday helps them. I clearly need to find a balance!

Hell, we forget about things that we *ourselves* are interested in. There's no controlling who it happens to or what it's about. If it can be remembered, it can also be forgotten. Meds don't give us perfect memory.  Don't shame yourself for forgetting, it happens (a lot). Do the best that you can to resolve the problem and make the best of it.  Edit 1: Holy shit this blew up. I'm glad I was a source of much needed validation of your experiences and reality, guys.  Also, just a fun note, this post was inspired by the constant misunderstanding that neurotypical people seem to have about us when it comes to remembering. They don't realize that our brains just *refuse* to recall information, regardless of the time span between receiving it and trying to recall it.  My wife was unfortunately one of these people until I just showed her this post and the comments. You guys helped my wife understand what's really going on. She said she won't ever get mad at me for forgetting and to remind her of this post when she does. Thank you guys for that!  Thanks for the silver, you know who you are ;)

I take Vyvanse in the morning and a low dose of Adderall shortly after lunch. I work in a highly technical field and documentation for how we implement different solutions is part of my purview. Like most of us would, I hate this part of my job. I generally put it off as long as I can then try to make sure a 10 year old could successfully implement the solution following my documentation.   Today I was informed that my documentation is used in every region as an example of how documentation should be done. While I know I write well and I know my documentation is good I would have never thought that it would be the gold standard for a company. The global IT manager told me that I write the best documentation in the company.   I can honestly say it was a much needed boost. I'm always exhausted and completely useless after a documentation run. The compliments aren't going to change that but it does make me feel better about the effort it takes to do that part of my job.

It's kind of like the US collectively got a taste of what ADHD is like. My brain wants results from whatever it is I'm doing NOW, and when it takes longer, like maybe an hour, it's just so exhausting waiting to see the fruits of my labor.   So, Americans just got a taste of what ADHDers go through literally every hour. It's just continual exhaustion (apart from when we get lucky and hyper-focus).

They tell me to stop using my ADD as an excuse; but you see if they would remember it on their own I wouldn’t have to constantly remind them when my ADD causes me to behave a certain way.   Oh I’m sorry my disability is such a hindrance to you, but just try being me for even a day. You wouldn’t last 5 minutes. And my ADD is moderate. I don’t even want to think about what those with severe ADHD go through.   My own family tells me to pay attention, and when I showed my mom an ADHD meme she told me “you should just try harder” as if it’s a choice. I got diagnosed 9 years ago and my family has yet to understand what it does to me. They don’t seem to try to either.   They always seem to expect me to do things at their pace too, which I can’t do. It stresses me out. They expect me to just get up and go when I can’t motivate myself that easily. They expect me to be able to do things within a certain frame of time when giving me a time limit stresses me out.   I’m done living other people’s ways instead of my own.  Edit: I didn’t realize so many people struggled so badly because of this same exact situation. I’m sorry y’all had to go through what you did, but at least we have each other on this subreddit now.  Edit 2: Holy shit I got an award, thank you kind sir/lass for my first ever award on this app. It made my day. Thank you for all the awards you guys!

Having to buy replacements for things that I’ve forgotten to bring somewhere, impulsively buying weird shit and never using it, perusing expensive hobbies I abandon, buying a massive amount of caffeine and nicotine, having to pay for another train ticket after I lost my return...   The list goes on   I wonder how much I could’ve saved if I didn’t have ADHD, and how many other expenses I haven’t realised might be thanks to my adhd. ugh
008e275b1f8bd9f0042a0e17bf6e6c5ffd5b2e080572f1ac15ca8c8f26044f4c;;;This is how people with ADHD can work twice as long, work 3x faster, complete more than 5x the amount of tasks, see over 1000% more detail...and still feel like crap for not getting anything done.;;;Here’s an example I use to explain to others what happens when I’m tasked with something. Over the years “task” has meant: homework, housework, work assignments, group tasks, personal hobbies, fill in the blank...    ##Situation #1:  *Say you ask someone (neurotypical) to do “Task A”, you need it done in 3 hours.*  They look at it and see about 10 steps needed complete it. They work for 2 hours and get 9 of those 10 done. “Good enough”, they think. In their mind, they’re ending with a mental todo list 90% finished. They go relax for an hour.  If they got a grade? A-. They walk away feeling good having finished a task and doing it pretty well.  ###*So: 9 out of 10 tasks in 2 hours. That’s roughly one task every 15 mins to get 90% done and an hour to relax. Internal score: A-*   ##Now, Situation #2:  *You ask me (ADHD, 2e) to do “Task A”:*  I look and see 100 possible details. I catch a vision of what “Task A” could be, and am extremely excited by it. I see how “Task A” fits into other Tasks (B, C, D, E, F), and how it makes them easier for other people. “Task A” if done right, can support itself, help the people who need to do it after me and potentially generate enough resources to create new Tasks (W!?, X!?, Y!?...dare I say, even Z!?) Man, if I can get this done “Task A” will be incredible. This feeling...it’s electric.   At first glance I can see at least 9 details related to, and needing accounted for, each of the original 10 steps. I’m unfamiliar with a couple of the details, so I’ll need to do some research to resolve my questions. What’s more, there are irrelevant details buried in the pile, but I don’t know which ones yet, so I’ll need to be actively sifting those out while I work.  For the next 4 hours I work on it like crazy, riding the wave of my excitement. Guided by the image in my head, I’m working hard to get it done. But, because of distractibility, I get sidetracked other random tasks.  Add to that I’ve come up with 10-20 more unforeseen and potentially irrelevant details. It’s okay though, I’m getting momentum and really starting to weave the threads together.   My focus is having holes poked in it because people keep interrupting me. It’s not malicious, they are just being friendly by saying “Hi”, or trying to get me to smile because I look so intense. They don’t know how hard I’m holding my focus together, and that every distraction is like a wind gust against my attentional house of cards. There’s been some unravelling, but I try to shake off my anger and get back to reweaving them quickly.   I‘ve been working at a pace of about one task every 5 mins. I look up and realize its been 4 hours, “crap!” I’m an hour over. I take stock of where I’m at. I have crossed 48 tasks off my mental todo list of (now) 120, but am only about 40% finished. That’s a big mental “F” (in more ways than one).  ###*So: 48 of 120 tasks in 4 hours. One task every 5 minutes and only 40% done. Score: F*  **This is how people with ADHD can work twice as long, work 3x faster, complete more than 5x the amount of tasks, see over 1000% more detail...and still feel like crap for not getting anything done.**  Okay...I try to take stock of where I am. At the pace I was going, it will take me 10 hours to finish. The break has made me realize I haven’t eaten. I’m starting to feel bad. I’m mentally exhausted and my brain is fried. I’m way over my deadline and it was needed an hour ago. At this stage its not even finished enough to be usable.   This isn’t the first time this has happened, far from it, so now I’m also feeling defeated. I also feel demotivated because I don’t actually know how much longer its going to take me to finish, so I engage in procrastination as a stress relief tool.   Now I’m working much slower, because experiencing this pattern is what kickstarts a depression. “This always happens...” I look at what I still need to do. It’s likely going to take me a possible 50+ hours to work through the remaining 72 tasks I FEEL need to get done. The end of the task stretches away toward the horizon, like a long, vast road. *”Man, this sucks...”*. Every minute I continue is a slog that drags me down further. But it has to get done...  I stay up all night working on it. The silence and lack of interruption helps, but it’s still slow.  ...In the morning come the text messages.  People asking me questions about the task. Some innocuous, *“Hey, just checking on the status of “Task A”?”*, some not, *“Hey we NEED “Task A” to be done as soon as possible, we have people waiting on it. When will you be done?”* I feel shame.  An immediate dread that feels like daggers. Stress. Cortisol and adrenaline coursing through my body like a weird familiar fire. And then, an immediate dive into a full depression.   I feel they are justified in their frustration. I’m frustrated with me too.   *“Why does this always happen?”*     *“Why can’t I just get things done?”*     *“Why is this so hard for me when it’s so easy for other people?”*     *“Why can’t I just think more simply?”*      And then to add to the heartbreak, *“Man, this could be so useful, and so great...if I could just get it done.”*  “...”  *“...I suck.”*     *“...I hate this feeling.”*     *“...I wish I wasn’t such a failure.”*       It’s a strange thing we have. It’s the source of my creativity and wonder. And also the source of my darkest times. That feeling fades, and some things get better. But this pattern seems to be close at all times.  I feel like I’m always trying to defend why “creative” people seem to struggle getting things done. While it’s exacerbated by ADHD, it is also a problem with creative types. While they are commonly judged as flaky or undisciplined, I really think it has to do with the challenge of having more dots to connect than the average person. And then having to deal with the mental repetitive stress injuries that come from weathering other’s lack of understanding. Which then only reflexes back onto the problem like a serpent that is eating its own tail.
2a1341cdf216e401b8659683097847e86da4d87f42e761baa9614f02ad9e93fc;;;I broke down crying yesterday because I realized an hour had passed since I meant to leave to go to the store. I'm really jealous of people who can just go do things.;;;I made tacos, and realized we had no cheese. My husband would normally go, but he wanted to work so I was going instead. I asked my school-age sister (I'm her guardian) to come with me to the store, cause she's barely left her bed this week since it's Feb break for her. She whined about leaving her game with her friends until I realized the irritation wasn't worth it for me in that moment.  I asked my husband to have a conversation with her after I left about how she needs to not prioritize playing games over household duties. I'm a gamer too, I get you can't pause everything, but I offered to wait 15 minutes. She's just running around with her friends on Roblox, she'll do that until bedtime after we get back anyway. He, well-intentioned, immediately went to tell her to come see him after she got a break in her game.  I went in and out of brain fog for a while trying to figure out what was missing in the fridge, since we hasn't cooked in a couple of days and there were no leftovers so it looked like there was a huge amount of empty space. Then I talked to my husband about what he was going to say to my sister, since I wanted him to be clear that her playing games with her friends for most of the day is not a problem, she just needs to be able to drop it when needed. She likely also has ADHD. I don't want to shame her for literally what I do sometimes (play video games all day), I just want to teach her a life skill.  Of course, after this conversation finishes time magically passes (I have no idea what happened) and suddenly it's been 25 minutes and my sister comes out of her room. She thinks she's coming with me. I say oh, that wasn't the plan, but yeah grab your coat. She, confused and frustrated, is like wait, is that not why I was being called out? I was going to spare her the lecture since she came out on her own, so I had already told her that wasn't what it was about. She, realizing that she was not being forced to leave, slowly inched back to her room. She says something along the lines of "oh, I don't want to make you upset though, so call me out to get groceries!" And I'm like... no. I'm asking you to come with me. I have 3 times. You already left your game, and still refuse. I'd rather forget you're there than accept half help.  She goes and plays her game, I, frustrated, look around the kitchen more and realize its been 45 minutes. I had decided that rather than just go get cheese for dinner, I needed to take my sister and get all the groceries. I go "well, okay, fuck this, no one wants dinner anyway" and angrily flop on my bed. I bash my head a few times (bad I know), kick around, and eventually just start crying. My husband comes to see whats up, and I'm like...  @husband: I know I unfairly load you with a lot of daily tasks. Laundry. Groceries. Dishes. Lots of stuff. But it's because I ask you to do something and you just **do** it. And you're done in half an hour or less. I could have been back from the store 20 minutes ago. It's so unfair that every time I try to do something simple, I end up trying to do 5 other things. And it's not even distractions in this case. Even now I think it makes more sense to go get all the groceries. I think my sister needs to get out of the house. I think correcting her being so tunnel-visioned without being yanked out of it and pouting the whole time is important. I still, while sitting here breaking down, can't just prioritize getting the fucking cheese. I'm realizing I needed someone to go with me just so I had a bit more accountability and I didn't get distracted in the kitchen or zone out driving or grab 10 unrelated things in the store. And I was just angry about it. While I was crying I was angry it happened, angry I was wasting time crying over it, angry that I was hungry, angry that I was distracting my husband from work. Just angry.  It sucks because I feel like I can just go do it. My leg isn't broken, I'm not dizzy, I wasn't anxious prior to breaking down, it doesn't *feel* like there's anything preventing me from leaving. It's just repeated choices I'm making. And yet it happens over and over and over again even as I chastise myself for it.  I took a solid hour to properly calm down (it was like a release valve got hit, I would calm down for a minute then get angry and cry again). After that all 3 of us went to the store. Dinner was cold. I still grabbed random things (I HAVE FRESH MOZZARELLA FOR HOMEMADE PIZZAAAA!) But I felt better. I'm lucky I have support. But god ADHD sucks.  I'm trying to be nicer to myself. I'm not angry I've not gotten a lot of things done this week that I meant to. I just felt so powerless.
8ac73f346b1f427ba94cece27e2b8e0d225955e311f013ae5363e0c8e431cec7;;;It's said people with ADHD have no filter, so I built a dam.;;;I tried to improve my personality, and even that wasn’t good enough, according to my grad school advisor  I was diagnosed with ADHD as an adult when I first started grad school. I never had trouble in school as a child. But after learning a lot more about ADHD over the last year, I realized that so many of my insecurities are rooted in my ADHD symptoms.  It isn't exactly a confidence booster to read a 'list of 10 annoying personality traits' and walk away with what might as well be an excerpt from the ADHD section of the DSM.  I’ve always hated my personality (or what I called my personality) and tried desperately to pinpoint what exactly it was that I was doing wrong and change. I hate that I’m loud, talk way too fast, accidentally interrupt and intrude, can’t sit still or listen, can’t be patient. And over time, I started hating myself for all of those reasons. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to think of myself as anything but annoying and obnoxious, and I spend a lot of my time trying to regulate my behavior with willpower alone.  Don’t talk too much. Don’t say things people aren’t interested in. Don’t come on too strongly or overwhelm anyone. Don’t get too excited or eager for things. Sit down and listen. If you say something at all, make sure it’s relevant, necessary, and eloquent. Don’t ask unnecessary questions or ask for help with stupid things you should know how to do. When in doubt, just be quiet so you don’t bother anyone.  And fast forward a year of trying not to get in anyone’s way in grad school, I receive feedback from my advisor that I don’t have a personality. They don’t know what to think of me or whether or not I really ‘fit in’ with our cohort because I’m pretty unreactive and don’t show too much emotion. I’m too hierarchical and incapable of being informal around people.  And what am I supposed to reply to this? Should I make my advisor breathe a sigh of relief by letting them know they wouldn’t want to deal with my personality anyway? That I’m saving them a lot of grief?  And what am I supposed to think of all of this? Apparently, I have two settings: loud and annoying or aloof and rigid.  I’ve pushed myself into this corner where I only like myself when other people like me. I had a good day when I didn’t annoy anyone. I had a bad day when I talked unnecessarily or wasted someone’s time. But now, it’s not just enough to not be annoying and have people like me.  It’s said that people with ADHD don’t have a filter, so I fixed that problem by sealing it all off by building a dam. And I don’t think I know how to be selective with what I let flow through.  It feels like I’m playing a game, but I don’t know the rules. And I don’t even want to win; I just want to earn some points here and there for the things I manage to get right, which isn’t often.  I don’t know what joke I make is going to end up being a charming and clever remark or be taken as rude and uncalled for. I don’t know whether a story I’m about to tell will be genuinely interesting or a boring time-waster. And a lifetime of trial and error hasn’t led me to figuring this out any better, so I just stopped telling jokes, stopped sharing stories, and figured I can’t possibly lose if I just refuse to play.  Yeah, somehow, I still managed to do even that wrong, too.
4e5a97d3f26e63f5cb23abbc997340aa4b3daafdf5d5e22c60fd80cec82679ae;;;Letter to my boss I’ll never be able to send. You fired me because my reaction to new ADHD meds sent me to hospital. Twice. You literally suck.;;;Hey you. You suck.   You’ve let me go because “it’s been twice where I haven’t shown up to work and you had to call around looking for me”.   I got nurses/paramedics to call you an hour PLUS before my shift started. Both times. You didn’t pick up until an hour after my shift would’ve started. BOTH TIMES.   But you know this.  Both of these times, as explained in both discharge letters, were UNEXPECTED. I could not have foreseen almost having a heart attack the day before it happened, these meds are designed to help me.   Again, you literally know this.   You know my dad hits me, you know I now don’t have a home because I couldn’t live around him anymore. You know I had to fight to get a government payment.   You know that payment depends on how many hours I work. I need a certain amount of hours a week to get the payment and you know that.   You let me cry on your shoulder the day after I left my dad. You said you’d support me. You fired me over text and won’t pick up my calls. You didn’t tell any of my coworkers or the kids that I take care of. You didn’t even let me say goodbye to the fucking kids.    All in all, you suck.    Un-kind regards,  “Literally one of the best employees you’ve ever had”  EDIT: Hey guys...! Made me cry a lil seeing your support! Couple things to clear up;  - I am, in fact, in Australia  - I am 19 and have zero dollahs for a lawyer/legal options  - i have lots of support from my partner and their family, I’m quite lucky despite everything!   So thanks for your comments, messages and advice, I didn’t expect my late night rant to get any attention... you guys made me a little bit more hopeful.

I survived the pandemic and found a way to study less with store only highlights of every course. Best part is, we didn't even have the online studying thing cuz my country is dead poor in regards to that level of innovation. 4 months of staying at home procrastinating till the week just before exams and yet I have triumphed. THIS IS HUGE YALL!!!    EDIT : OMG GUYS THANK YOU A MILLION TIMES FOR THE AWARDS AND THE LOVELY COMMENTS. I LOVE YOU GUYS VERY MUCH AND LOVE ALL THIS COMMUNITY ❤️❤️

They are able to execute the instructions I've given them properly and benefit from it, but when it comes to executing plans I've made for myself I just never seem to get it right or rather I shouId say that I never seem to get started.   Edit : Thank you kind strangers for the gold & silver. I've noticed that some people are saying that they are not good planners and that they execute best at the last minute. I find that relatable, even though I think of myself as a good planner. The most productive and noteworthy things I've been able to accomplish were all unplanned and kinda pushed on me. I think all ADHD people live by the motto, "If tomorrow isn't the due date, today isn't the do date".  Reading comments from you all makes me think that I am reading about myself just on different days of the week. I can literally relate to everything you all are saying. This kinda makes me feel that we are all in this together and we will get through it all. I always second doubt my own ideas and generally question my ability to lead a 'normal' life, but listening to you all gives me much hope. You all deserve all the loves and hugs in the world. Thank you for being so supportive !

HOW? Does the brain just shut up when your head hits the pillow? Do you conveniently forget about everything you haven't finished today, and everything you need to do for the rest of the week? Do you not have a vivid story that you need to create in your head every night? It genuinely sounds fake to me, I just cant wrap my head around it.  \[edit\] My phone hasn't stopped buzzing with notifications since i posted this. Help. This was a mistake lol

One of the first things we tackled with my therapist was having a fixed morning routine and logging it every day.    Today was the 71st day of keeping up with that. I know it’s something everyone just does without thinking but for me it feels like I’ve climbed Everest!   A big shout out to my therapist who kept me motivated in the friendliest way possible and another one for my doctors and nurses for how much they supported me :)  [Look at my cool routine graph!](https://i.imgur.com/k6WYt2P.jpg)  **Edit**: This blew up! Thanks for all the love and the awards <3 <3 <3  Here's how I did it (sorry for the wall of text lol):  So I tried keeping a morning routine a few times, but never succeeded to keep if for more than a few days. I tried many habit apps for this but I couldn't stay motivated with them. Apps are mostly designed to do the routine at a particular time and most of them 'punish' you if you break your streak. Also, I couldn't find an app that let me journal my way and track whats most important for me. I also tend to zone out between the different steps of my routine, so I needed an app to kind of nudge me when that happens.  And I used to get disheartened and give up if I couldn't start on time or skip a day. My therapist helped me get over that and we decided I just do it and track it, and not aim for doing it every day or starting exactly on time. This, along with just freely logging the start and end times without any pressure to be on time helped me maintain my streak :)  With my morning routine I do 5 things every day:  1.  wake up (lol) (1m) 2.  make tea and practice learning a language (15m) 3.  shower and get ready (40m) 4.  eat breakfast and take meds (20m) 5.  go for a short walk outside (15m) (or leave for work)  I use an interval timer app to set up a stepped interval timer for all of the above steps. I use [MultiTimer](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/multitimer-multiple-timers/id973421278) but you can use any other similar app. It is free. The timer pauses after each step and sends you notifications every few seconds till you resume the next step (very very useful if you zone out).   After all steps are done I log the start and stop time into an Numbers file (Apple's Excel) along with a star rating for how many things I completed (5 stars = did everything) and another star rating for how I felt after the routine. Optionally I also write down what went well (eg. feeling fresh) and what didn't go well (eg: didn't sleep well, zoned out, etc.). [This is what it looks like](https://imgur.com/a/gMHpNNw)  I created the Numbers file on my phone and then spent a good amount of time playing with the format and colours till I liked it. It automatically calculates how much time I took and takes a median of all my ratings, start times and end times. And it also plots a cool graph of all the start/end times.  Here's the the Numbers template: https://we.tl/t-sYChvm5bOC (I sadly don't know how to do it in Excel/Google Sheets, but if you wanna try it, feel free to ask me any questions!)
28aad78e8f763124b72262faf15297fcd1a96f90704b1813a9e164e5db343b0a;;;Adhd is a SPECTRUM;;;I thought I was only JUST on the ADHD spectrum, and that I was just lazy and had no discipline. I thought that I had to be a particular way to be ADHD- everyone I knew who had ADHD made me feel like I couldn't possibly have the same thing as them.  To everyone seeking diagnosis: it's a SPECTRUM. And just because someone else is ADHD, doesn't mean you will be the very same, have the same problems, and get along like two peas in a pod.  Remember that your symptoms are REAL, and that ADHD does not account for personality differences.  **TLDR; ADHD is variable.**  **Edit**: I've been reading every comment (even if I didn't reply) and I'm so glad I'm not alone- you guys are really nice and its been interesting reading about what problems you face (like driving!).  1. Yes "spectrum" is a misnomer, but I've seen it applied to ADHD hence it's use in this post. It's more like a series of clusters, if you prefer literal imagery. 2. ADHD is not a competition. If someone else in your life "has it worse" it doesn't discount your own symptoms and struggles.

Earlier this year, I finally convinced them to let me give it a try, and was prescribed Vyvanse. If I hadn’t been, I don’t know if I would have been able to put in the work to get accepted into college. I applied as a music education major, and had to play catch up to get my audition songs ready, with three months to do so (November-February). This required me to practice for about two-three hours a day, sometimes four. It was hard to keep myself on this schedule, but I did it. I got into Mason Gross, one of the best music schools around me. I’m super proud of myself for being able to commit to this level of work, and I hope I can continue to have this much motivation and success.
deb0ef5430aca4e23e4efa1eeb5f17faeb41ba544b0ceb28c897ec35646a8e92;;;I hate arguing with my wife, because I can't remember any specific instance of anything.;;;That's it, really.  I can never "win" arguments with my wife, or even make her acknowledge the merits of what I'm saying because when she says "when have I ever..." I can't remember anything. Ever. Even though I know she's said or done it, probably recently.   Its just really fucking frustrating.   /rant  **Edit: Thanks for all the replies! It's really nice to know that I'm not the only one!**  A few addenda:  First, no, my wife isn't gaslighting me. This isn't something she does maliciously. As I replied to one redditor: my frustration comes less from my wife asking "when..." because in a healthy, and compassionate relationship that's a fair question. It's more from my inability to articulate the "when".  That being said, if you're in a relationship where you believe someone is doing this to you on purpose, that's absolutely not healthy.   Second, yeah, I know no one "wins" an argument, that's why I put it in quotes. I don't run around picking fights with my wife so that I can tally some imaginary scoreboard. Nor does she with me.   Third, I got some really great responses, and I appreciate all the constructive feedback! Yall are awesome. I tried to compile all the various suggestions I got, so here they are:   **Retaining Details:**  /u/msmurasaki You have to get a calendar and then jot down stuff on those days you don't like a certain aspect. Then review them occasionally to help you remember. Also find the source of the problem, not the instance. Use that calendar to find the actual source/pattern that you don't like. E.g. if she says something rude now and then, don't bring up ONE instance. Rather go to the source, which may be 'i find that sometimes you say inconsiderate things, I hope that you can take a Second to think next time before saying stuff that may hurt, and rather be more tactful. If she asks for examples, THEN you bring up the instances in that calendar.  A lot of people suggested keeping some form of notes: journal, phone notes, Gnotes, diary, text screenshots, etc. And just as many people said they feel a little petty or creepy about it to which /u/gonnaquittom said: “If you want to feel less pretty about it you could call it journaling, which it is.”  Several people also suggested discussing the issue immediately if you can.  On the flip side: /u/jcon877 observed that sometimes we need time to gather all the info given to us, piece it all together and form our response. “For me, this can take 1 hour or even a whole day sometimes.”  **Meta-Discussion:**    /u/Slingshotsters brought up the idea of the “metafight.” I really liked the idea, so I’m stealing it. Lots of advice came down to how to have a better conversation with my wife, up to and including having the “meta-fight” discussion, i.e. talking about how we talk about things.  /u/lizzledizzles pointed out that we shouldn’t allow the argument to get bogged down in semantics, which is basically exactly what happens when we start chasing the “when have I ever…” line of reasoning. And /u/WhyAreYouAllHere added to that by pointing out we shouldn’t allow “kitchen sinking,” we should try to understand what we want to talk about and stick as closely to that as possible. If/when that’s not possible, maybe try the argument mapping suggestions. Or, as /u/huckfinn52 said “I stopped trying to remember instances and details and I just focus on remembering my feelings.”   When it comes to talking to our S/O’s more effectively, /u/Yellow_Lemon_Monster suggested providing context. Sometimes they don’t need to know exactly what happened. As /u/crazydevillady pointed out “Even if I don’t remember specifics - I blurt out jumbled pieces. Then for a brief second, I can see it register in his eyes- even when I can’t piece it together.”  For those of us who just aren’t great at talking anyway, /u/sebtaylor01suggested we “don’t talk about it, put it in writing.” I actually have used this method with my wife in the past. We’ll put stuff in an email to initiate a conversation. That allows us to organize our thoughts, and re-read everything, and make sure we’re saying what we want to say. /u/Orangegrapejello pointed out that text and email is also be useful for relationships that aren’t on great terms (ex’s, estranged family, etc)  /u/reluctantlyvegan said we should learn to “accept the stalemate.” Sometimes the best we can do is to make our point as best as we can and hope that our S/O will understand us after they’ve had some time to process.  **Argument Mapping:**  /u/OliviaParamour “when I get into a serious argument/discussion, what I try to do is: Take a piece of paper and draw a line. a timeline from the start of the argument to the end of the argument (i assume 1 hour) And then I draw lines coming out of that lines when points are made by either of us. If we go down a branch of an argument, then I draw a line of that line and continue it.”  **Active Listening:**  If our S/O’s initiate the conversation (or even if they didn’t) /u/elciteeve noted that “it's important to actively listen... Make sure you understand them and validate their feelings (which doesn't mean just Agreeing with their point.) I think especially for adhd people it's easy to instantly go into full rejection mode and either shut down, get defensive, or whatever other non-helpful strategy we learn as kids.  Remember that by actively listening and asking for clarification, then validating their feelings, you might realise you interpreted their meaning wrong at first. Which is how many arguments turn heated so quickly.”  /u/NettingStick suggested “radical honesty. If anything’s bugging us, we bring it up immediately and neither of us treats it as some sort of personal attack or failing.” This isn’t for the faint of heart, though.   **Side note:**  Finally, /u/jonnierod offered some valuable insight into the reliability of working memory generally: “I used to do investigations at work and one thing I learned is that when you hold anybody's memory up to the harsh light of evidence no one has a good memory. No one. I never interviewed a person who didn't at one point or another have to amend their statement as more evidence was presented. I'm not saying they were lying, I'm just saying when people start having to verify what they know we all fold like lawn chairs.”  Thanks again everyone!  Edit 2: Ran across this article that gave some useful specific suggestions for communicating with your SO, so I thought I add it here. https://twodrifters.us/blog/couples-communication-exercises.html

I could control what i want to do, if i want to do something i can do it instead of procrastinating it. i can choose what i say and plan out how i want to say it. i can choose what i pay attention to and how i spend my time.

Thank you Reddit!;;;After more than a year of thinking "I need help" I finally **picked up the phone and called my GP** (I'm in the UK). They gave me an appointment for next week in which I'll ask to be referred to a psychiatrist.  **How did I do it**? I imagined myself doing it and concentrated very hard on the sensation I'd get once I do it.  And now I have that sensation, it's amazing! I can't wait to start this path and release my potential!  Thank you, People of Reddit, for showing me I'm not alone and **it's ok not to be normal**. Your experiences and advice have been essential in my decision to ask a professional for help.  &#x200B;  edit: I am reading some comments about how long it takes to **get a diagnosis in the UK**. Many people recommend using [Right to Choose](https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/choice-in-mental-health-care-v2.pdf) (thanks u/London_Dachshund) and ask to be referred to services like [Psychiatry-UK](https://www.psychiatry-uk.com/adhd/). It cuts down the waiting from months to a few weeks!
4921b1c3a6cd3bc69b2c2a967a26ea70f9d5e4125e99c308a71311ace7ec489f;;;What adderall WON’T do for you;;;I’ve recently in the last month been professionally diagnosed with ADHD, after going 20 years without any medication or treatment of any kind. When hearing about adderall from everyone else, it’s easy to put it on a pedestal, and become easily reliant and attached to the medication as if it’s going to turn you into a superhero. Sad news is, it doesn’t. While it certainly helps(!), it’s not a miracle drug. It doesn’t write your schedule, it doesn’t go to the grocery store for you, and it definitely doesn’t do your laundry (sadly). It’s very easy to take it, and waste the whole day doing “more important tasks” like grinding Valorant and Overwatch. You’re still you, and you still have ADHD. The other half of the equation to treatment is discipline and practice. I’ve been expecting that after taking adderall, that I would magically just become Mr. Business Man and start planning everything weeks ahead, be able to get all my chores done, and etc., you get the point. I guess what I’m trying to say, is that adderall isn’t the end all be all. And to rely on a medication to do that for you is a recipe for substance abuse. Adderall helps, it really does. But you have to be willing to use that help in a positive manner :)

And daggone! you guys are fast!  TL:dr Thank you. (please don't ban me 😉)  Edit: I'm just getting back to this post because I was working on my Win It Wednesday 😁 and Ho-lee Cow! I didn't add much detail last night because I thought it really wasnt going to be allowed but I'll tell you guys what prompted this post. At 2 am EST someone posted a "mean" post, though that's a bit of an understatement. That post was only active for 15 or 20 mins before it was locked & removed. That means hundreds, if not thousands, of people did not wake up this morning to a long, heated, hateful argument that made them question the progress they had made in their lives. While we were sleeping someone was watching over our safe place so that when we woke up, it was still safe.  Second! Definitely high 5's all around to everyone who posts, everyone who is honest about their struggles and their victories, everyone who contributes to the discussion and offers kind supportive words, everyone who makes me laugh because I identify with the silly stuff so much! Thank you! You're a great community.

I feel like my whole life is about to restart and I can start doing better from here.;;;I'd like to thank this thread for the continuous support! You guys are awesome.  Edit: wow, thank you all so much! 😊❤️ I'll answer all I can!  Edit edit: for those misunderstanding, I am not swearing by Vyvanse after day 1 of taking it! I haven't even taken it yet. I simply meant by receiving this diagnosis and help, I feel completely understood and I feel like my life is just beginning! Thanks for all the love you guys!

(Sweden);;;I finally have something to feel really proud of. Hell even my parents are proud of me and that just doesn't happen. I don't think I've ever heard my mom sound proud like that before yesterday. I've basically lived in poverty for the past 15 years and felt like shit about myself for so long, I think my life is turning around at last. I got my ADD diagnosis at 27, why my countless doctors didn't think to even consider ADHD even though my journal from when I was 18ish stated I had severe concentration issues is beyond me. I'm a girl and not hyper and got good grades, I guess I didn't show the usual warning signs, but still. I'm basically Dory from Finding Nemo.  In Sweden we have a version of the SATs that you can take twice every year, and you can use the score to apply for educations. 34% of the spots avaliable are allocated to people using the SAT score (so 20 spots on the psychology programme), the rest of the spots are given to people with the highest grades. A year ago I did he test and scored higher than 99% of the people that took the test and it allowed me to get into basically any education in Sweden. (You need straight As to get in otherwise and I don't have that.) The psychology programme was listed today in the local paper as the hardest to get into out of 200 programmes at the university of Gothenburg, I feel proud as hell. It's such a strange feeling.  Don't give up people! I'm well over 30 now and I feel like my life is just beginning, it took me a long time to get here and that's okay. We may fall down over and over but if we don't stop trying we'll eventually get somewhere better. For the first time ever I feel hope for my future. I just wanted to share this, the struggle has been overwhelming and I know you all understand how hard it can be. I did it guys, I finally did it.
bcc667a3789ffe6e4a1aa3e6b65ae06176639ed3d15c49481a0f0cbcd34e26e6;;;Guard your minds, there be gaslighters afoot;;;"I just want to be normal"  A common sentiment, especially for people with ADHD.  Our memories fail us, executive functioning is all out of whack, and we just seem to struggle more than the people around us.  It sucks.  And we automatically learn how to hide it, by masking.  We smile and nod through conversations when we can't process them in real time.  We take emotional cues from other people when we're not sure how much is appropriate.  And we rely on other people's memories to fill in the gaps when our own memory fails us.  But there's a danger to doing this too.  People who don't trust their own memory are prime targets for gaslighting and abuse.  It starts off small. Your friend unexpectedly announces that you'd planned to meet up with them today.  You followed all the instructions your boss gave you to the letter, but now he says that you did it all wrong.  A collegue made a bad joke at your expense and is now telling you you shouldn't be so sensitive about it.  And these are all things that people with ADHD do genuinely do - we forget, we are bad at planning, we take rejection to heart.  But if you feel like in a certain environment your ADHD is magnified more than normal, start being critical of the people around you.  Did you really plan that meeting?  You have no record of it on WhatsApp, where did that idea to meet come from?   Your boss said that the way you've followed the instructions is all wrong, but he was never clear about them in the first place.   And check in with a friend - was that joke out of line?  Get a second opinion.  It might not be you being overly sensitive.  Don't be afraid to trust your own memories over what others tell you.  Don't be afraid to challenge the narrative they're trying to feed you.  If it turns out they were right after all, no harm done, you tested a situation well.  Its better than feeling like your ADHD is out of control around oddly specific people, and you're going insane.  &#x200B;  Tl;Dr: ADHD makes you a prime target for gaslighting.  Trust your own memories and if things don't line up, don't automatically suspect the problem is with you.

Just someone struggling with ADHD, trying to find ways to cope with it. So like with any advice, please take this with a grain of salt. Do it yourself, if you're feeling like you're losing sense of yourself, Stop it. You're doing it wrong. If done right, this should feel like meditating.**  Edit : Holy Fuck! my inbox exploded! Oh man I'm crying. I'm so happy that you used this and actually accomplished something. Thank you for all the awards.  # tl:drs at the bottom of the post. And read the large texts  # 1. Method  Yup. Switch to 3rd person. visualize yourself from behind, like in a game. This really helped me to start studying when I didn't feel like it, the past 2 days. And it seems promising. And whenever your attention shifts to something else (which is, for most of us every 2 fucking seconds) switch to 3rd person. Hell! Always be in 3rd person mode. When you're having an emotional breakdown, or when you're trying to make a life-changing decision (where most of us have a bit of a hard time) don't refer to yourself as "You". Refer yourself in your name. For example, "Oh yeah. Now I'm typing out a reddit post about how to get shit done using the new trick I've found while the shit needed to be done using the new trick I've found rots. I should get back to work", should be changed to "Bruce is typing a reddit post advising his fellow ADHDers about how to get shit done using the new trick he found while the shit needed to be done using the new trick he found rots. He should get back to work". See how drastically it changes our viewpoint? It feels like I'm in a movie or a videogame, fighting against villains such as distraction, Anger, negative self talk, for my life. Just like Batma..Whoops. Bruce Wayne. And it sounds cool as hell. Try this out friends.  Edit : I had some more things in mind to say but I forgot it so fuck it. have a nice day y'all. Batman out!  Edit 2 : Whoa! didn't expect this so many responses. Thank you all and Thanks for the Award kind anonymous redditor. So while replying to a comment, I think I figured out why this works so well. So here is my two cents.  # 2.Why this works?  The way I understand it, it's because when we use words like "you" "we" or our name to address ourselves instead of using "me", We detach ourselves from... well, ourselves. As ADHDers, most of us have high failures to success ratio. So our past experiences about failing is more prominent. So when we try to do something, We can not overcome the resistance because we already know the outcome. It's already hard for us to find motivation and focus to do a task, and those experiences make it even worse. So when we're addressing ourselves to something other than "I", we break out of that barrier that is made out of negative memories. Because we didn't see the struggles of Elon Musk right? We only saw this highly successful person, at **that moment.** If you see someone who is rich, have a nice job, have a beautiful girlfriend, you don't see what he's done to get to that place. We only see the outcome. And when we see ourselves in the same lens we used to see that stranger, wehave someone we saw just **now**. A perfect pile of clay, to mold into anyone we want. Sure, this won't fix the physiology of our brains, But it'll at least help us to reduce the everyday toll we take because of it, by countering it. it's like wearing a powered Exoskeleton to fight a physically superior threat, or Having a symbiote to help us survive, like Venom.  Hell! we can switch between 3rd person gaming and being with a Symbiote!  &#x200B;  # Isn't this just Dissociation?  No. See, Dissociation is feeling disconnected from your thoughts, feelings, memories, and surroundings. But this is the complete opposite of dissociation. You're not leaving yourself. You're **observing** yourself from a 3rd person perspective. It's like watching a friend getting angry, cry, procrastinate, or whatever. You're not gonna blame him, are you? But at the same time, You won't take it as personal as when you're going through the same things yourself. You're fully aware of the situation, but you're not reacting as hard as you could be. Now you're not blaming yourself for having these thoughts. Or for not doing anything for the past 3 days except laying in the bed paralyzed. It's **"Observing yourself made fun".**  Disassociation is what happens when you're on autopilot. This method forces you to stay aware. It's hard I know. But when you're repeatedly associating looking at yourself specifically in a 3rd person perspective, similar to a videogame, while you're walking, talking, doing chores whatever, and refer to yourself by your name, You're forced to be aware of yourself. It's like walking meditation without actually feeling like meditating.(We hate to meditate right?)  &#x200B;  **tl:dr - method :**  You can view yourself or think of yourself in third person perspective, to be more aware of your emotions, surroundings and your ;as they say ;'lAzInEsS' (Agh Fuck that word. But I couldn't find a better way to describe it)  **tl;dr - why this works? ;**  Well, it's a form of meditation. You're seeing yourself from an observer's perspective. You're observing all of your emotions for what it is. Like in a videogame. You're seeing all your player's emotions, What he's **Not doing,** What holds him back without being judgemental.  **tl:dr - Isn't this just dissociation? :** No. This is the complete opposite of dissociation. When you dissociate, you don't see yourself. You're being mindless. Like playing the game without an objective. without a mission. Blindfolded. With this method, you have to force yourself and always bring your attention back to yourself, or behind the head of yourself. It's like meditation without feeling like we're meditating.  Edit : 4  **Core;**  This is almost like an all day meditation without feeling like meditating. As people with ADHD, our main problem with meditation is most of the time, we can't stick to it. Seeing myself in 3rd person feels like always being aware of myself through someone else's eyes. Same thing as meditation, But because of the added videogame effect, we can actually reward ourselves while being self-aware. That's how I see it.

The emotional aspect of ADHD need to be studied further because from research and personal experience, I have found that it is one of the greater parts to ADHD. Emotional dysregulation, impulsively, anger issues, frustration, intense emotions have all been constantly found amongst those with ADHD. If we want to further our support, and improve our understanding of this condition, we must increase our research in this field.

I have struggled with trying to oht down roots due to depression anxiety and obviously ADHD. Everywhere I have ever been on vacation I seriously would be so happy there and consider living there. When i come back to my shit life and reality my depression would start and i would feel and find reasons to procrastinate due to depression. Time rolls this has gone on fore 10 years or more. Well fuck you life and I am moving to Scotland at easter or when this pandemic is over. It may not seem like a big deal but I have my mortgage in place.
31959f9dcee9761b559dac7107761563081bab362c8312903cc433aff94dd1ff;;;The worst fucking part about having adhd is that people will always blame you for being slow, for being absent minded, for not being able to achieve your goals, for feeling dull all the time, basically will make you feel like behaving this way is your CHOICE.;;;I have severe adhd. I can’t function better. I can’t ever get any support from the people around me because they don’t know jack shit about mental disorders. I am aching so so much yet no one sees that, I am so broken and I find no solace anywhere, I feel so incredibly ashamed of myself and how fucking slow and stupid I am, and the society too makes me feel this way. I feel so guilty for zoning out, feel guilty for not being able to do basic things. I need help so bad, I brain is so horribly fogged, i am not able to pull myself out of this rut, and I am not able to function, I’m a student and I find it very difficult to stay focused, and because of this I’m not able to achieve my goals, which in turn leads me to scoring badly in my exams, and since I’m from an Asian country, I get horribly criticised for not being able to do well in exams. I really really hate being alive, because my life is all about fighting myself and the world as well, I’m only battling with everything, I’m only experiencing the bitterness of life. I honestly wish I wasn’t born at all, cause from my experiences I’m pretty sure, that the world doesn’t need people like me. The slow, inefficient, the ill, the weak, the INCOMPETENT. My incompetence is my problem and I have to suffer with it all my life. The pain and struggle is mine and mine alone. I really wish life could end asap, I’m very tired.

When I went to my doctor to get tested, to my surprise she let me know that I had been diagnosed with ADHD when I was six years old. Twenty one years ago.   I called my mom, and she said something to the effect of "oh yeah, but you figured it out." I called my dad and he told me I was going to become a drug addict if I took anything for it.   I got on medication, and for the first time in my life it feels like I'm not fighting against myself constantly. I feel like all the coping mechanisms I've learned are actually getting me ahead, instead of helping me to bail water out of a boat with a giant hole in it.   I can't keep myself from thinking about all the times I was grounded and yelled at for poor time management, for not doing my homework, for not paying attention, and for my stuff being a mess. I keep thinking about all the trouble I had in school, and in college, and in work. And I keep thinking about how my parents knew why it was happening, and instead of helping me, just got mad that I dared to display symptoms of something I didn't even know I had. I thought there was something irreversibly wrong with me for twenty one years, and no one said anything.   I struggled for years and they just watched me, and punished me for the symptoms while they hid the root cause from me.  And I'm mad.

This isn’t anything against anybody who was described as gifted!**  Just wanted to acknowledge any of my fellow adhd peeps that **weren’t** recognised as gifted, talented or even that smart as kids.  I did well enough in some things and terrible in others. Average baverage. My adhd is still out here wasting whatever potential I have, even if it’s not much.   It’s also okay if you don’t have something to help you mitigate that feeling. We’re all valuable, no matter what we put out in to the world.  —————————————-  **Edit**: thanks for the engagement! Just edited to bold ‘weren’t’ coz I think some people are reading it as ‘were’ lol  **Edit 2**: Some of you guys! I know we’re out here being adhd but read the title before you comment, we’re talking about **not** being gifted rn haha, bless y’all. Also thank you for the awards everyone, much appreciated 💕  **Edit 3**: It’s been properly amazing to read all your thoughts and I feel a lot of hope for us all. If you fancy a little reading, do give Tolstoy’s very short story ‘How Much Land Does a Man Need’ a go. It helped put a lot of things in to perspective for me: what you own and achieve in your life won’t matter when we’ll all end up in ground. You’ve already done the world a great deal of good just by existing and living with your disability.
6b3ff88c07a6ca609d0b6d0616a0b6f02cbea1393e4d640f63398bae7a3cd31e;;;He stole my adderall on the morning of my MCAT exam and I feel like only y’all will understand how much this F*ed me up;;;My ex-boyfriend had a substance abuse problem that slowly flourished as our relationship simultaneously went downhill. Yes his problem originally began with prescription painkillers like many other Americans, but later developed into him taking any pills he came across. I tried to be supportive as he tried (“tried”) AA, NA, outpatient programs, and I even “waited” for him 3 months while he was in rehab. This situation happened after his first relapse following return from rehab.   A few months ago I had a much worse prescribing GP than I do now and she would only get around to sending me my month fill about once every two months, so these pills were carefully taken, and especially precious during the intensity leading up to my first MCAT (medical college admission test, 7.5 hours long) attempt. The morning of my exam I had set an adderall (what I thought was in secrecy) in the container I keep my earplugs on my side of the bed to take as soon as I woke up.   When I woke up there was no adderall there. I was absolutely 10/10 anxiety ridden and I screamed and cried for him to just tell me he took it so I could stop scraping the floors and searching everywhere, almost late. He SWORE to me, begging and pleading for me to believe him, that he would never take one of my pills on a morning like this. So important. The most important morning for me in our entire relationship. I begged for him to admit it, or give it back to me, and searched the floors, all the way until I absolutely had to leave. No calm coffee time, no morning review, absolute panic-stricken anxiety and anger, nothing else.   Not too long after this I kicked him out of my house and out of my life for good. He’s now living in a halfway house in another city. Since his to toxicity was no longer in my vicinity, I unblocked his number. I asked him if he did steal my medication the morning of my exam. He finally admitted that he did, and that he was sorry.   I can’t tell if his confession relieves me and the insanity I felt, or makes me hate him a million times more. I’m sorry for this lengthy rant, and thanks to anyone who read. I don’t feel like the Narcotics anonymous page or anyone else will understand how frustrating and hopeless I felt other than you guys. To him they were just my upper pills. To the takers, and to much of the world, we are seen as lazy, disorganized, anxious, explosive. Really, I’m just trying my best to keep up. To follow my dreams even if the expectations required are ridiculous for a person like me. That morning he didn’t steal my upper, he stole my calm, my serenity, my focus. He stole my confidence. I have no doubt this affected my score.   After the pandemic, I will take the exam again. I will have my medication and I will not have toxic takers in my bed. Cheers to shitty learning experiences, right?! 🍻 Love you guys, please stay safe.  Edit- Wow, did not expect such an amazing response from you guys! I checked back when this had like 300 upvotes, was like wow, sweet, then surprisingly (not!) forgot about it again! Please forgive me for my lack of responses/late responses, I’m slowly working on reading all your comments. You guys are the best, thank you so much for making me feel validated and heard. ❤️

I'm a college student and its 4:34am and I'm up because I'm SUPPOSED to be doing homework for my class tomorrow but I streamed and watched videos for the past 6 hours.

It gave me so much of what I needed to build the strength to let my current doctor go. I have a telehealth visit with her on Tuesday and planned on telling her that I will be finding a new doctor. For some reason, I'm extraordinarily nervous, but know I need to do this AND tell her why.   Incidentally, I took my 4yr old to the pediatrician today for her flu shot and found out by accident that our beloved doctor is family practice and I can see him too! I even specifically asked him if he's comfortable treating with patients with ADHD and he said yes! He even talked with me about how misdiagnosed people with ADHD are with depression and he said "I've had so many patients come in thinking they're depressed when in reality they have ADHD and they're just depressed because they can't get s*** done." Like he ACTUALLY gets it.  And he has known  me for YEARS as person not just as a patient. And my oldest is medically complicated so he knows us WELL. I'm so excited to have someone I really know and really really trust as MY doctor. I have a feeling I'm never going to be accused of drug seeking again!!  I want to cry!   Thank you everyone. I needed the groups validation to push through and make this change. My life is going to be so much better. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

That's how I feel most of the time.  I've recently been diagnosed with ADHD. I've had depression most of my life and long had trouble fitting in.  Now that my workplace is going to Work From Home, there's lots of opening up about how to stay positive, productive, and healthy when so many feel depressed, stir-crazy and anxious.   Across my sector and in the media it's so, so much about mental health and isolation, and I realize this is what it's like when everyone is going through what I and everyone else with depression have been through for so long.  Welcome to the suck, society.
23a510596ebfe01b8c328d5c63cc43f40ae672da3d88b550f7492449dc867fe1;;;Complete Transcript for "This is how you treat ADHD based off of science";;;Okay, I know Russell Barkley's video "How to treat ADHD based off of science" has been mentioned a few times lately but I posted about it 3 months ago give or take and lots of people asked if there was a transcript. I couldn't find an exact transcript, so I typed one up for you guys. Hope this helpful for some of you who can't sit through long videos (like me)  [Link to the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tpB-B8BXk0)  Transcript:  "So I want you to understand that you have a brain, the back part is where you learn, and the front part is where you do. **Knowledge/Performance. Knowing/Doing**. And **ADHD splits them apart**. I don’t care what you know, you won’t use it. You can be the brightest kid in the world, not going to matter. So, you’ve got a real problem on your hands, **because you can know stuff and you won’t do stuff**. That’s a serious problem called a performance disorder.  So what we know about ADHD is its going to **put all five of those levels at risk** because it interferes with all 7 executive functions. And you’re going to have time blindness and you won’t be able to aim your behavior toward the future, to care for yourself as well as other people are able to do. You have **intention deficit disorder**.  **You have a disorder of performance not knowledge. You know what to do but can’t do it. You have a disorder of the “when and the where” not the “what and the how”. Your problem is not with knowing what to do. It’s with doing what you know.**  What does this mean? It means that **all interventions must be out there, in the environment where you’re not doing what you know**. To help you show what you know. I have to create scaffolding around you to help you do this. What does this mean for treatment? Teaching skills is inadequate it won’t work. You can sit down with someone with ADHD and tell them what they need to do. Good luck. It’s not even going to leave your office. **You act like they’re stupid, they’re not. They know what to do. They know what you’re telling them to do**. There not going to do it. When they get out there **that information has no controlling value over their life**. And it ticks you off. You start to interpret it as a motivational problem. The only way to deal with executive deficit is to reengineer the environment around them to help them show what they know.  And all treatments must be out there in their life where you have to build that scaffolding. All of this in ADHD is due to neurogenic deficits and that means that medication is absolutely justifiable. **After all if you have a neurogenic disorder, then neurogenic therapies have a role to play in your disorder**. And they do. 80% of people with ADHD will be on medication at some point in their life. And good thing, it’s the most effective thing we have. There are other things we can do but that’s the most effective.  Now, you might be able to train up some of these executive functions, we don’t know that yet. We don’t know whether practicing working memory actually helps you in life, there’s no evidence that it does at this point, at least convincingly, but there’s a possibility. What we do know is that we are **not going to excuse you from your mistakes**, because the problem you’re having is not with consequences so why would I excuse them? The problem you’re having is with the delay to the consequence.  All important social consequences are delayed consequences, and that’s your problem. **Time**. So, the solution to any body’s problem with an executive deficit is to tighten up accountability. To make you **more accountable more often to other people with more consequences, artificial as they may need to be**, but I need to bring consequences very close to you in time. So, I’m not going to excuse your behavior. I’m actually going to hold you more accountable than other people. And that is why we do B-MOD.  B-MOD allows me to sprinkle artificial consequences all throughout the environment to improve your functioning. That means the success of my intervention is based on the willingness of other people in the natural environment to make those changes. If they’re not willing to build ramps so to speak, to build the scaffolding, it’s not going to work. The stakeholders have to be involved. It means that **ADHD is the diabetes of psychiatry. It’s a chronic disorder that must be managed, every day, to prevent the secondary harms it’s going to cause. But there is no cure for this disorder**.  Now, about 1 and 6 people might outgrow it. Maybe as many as 1 and 3, not sure yet. But the vast majority, **2/3, are going to continue to be ADHD in adulthood**. And they need to view ADHD as diabetes of the brain. It’s a chronic disorder. So, here are the things that my theory tells you to do to help people with executive deficits. This is what I told you this morning, this is a take home, cash value of shifting your framework from an attention disorder to an executive disorder. And the theory tells you all 6 things you got to do.  Step 1-You have to **make mental information physical**. You must externalize the information because **working memory is shot**. That means we have to use **cues, signs, charts, reminders, do lists**. I have to put stuff in your visual field to remind you of what needs to be done right here right now. Make it external again.  The next thing I have to do is **make time physical real through clocks, timers, counters, watch minders**, anything I can enlist that is going to put time outside of you. So that you can see it passing and judge your performance relative to it. **Cause you have no clock**. We got to put one in your visual field. I’m going to have to take lengthy assignments because they involve spans of time and get rid of time. Make them small quotas. Little baby steps over the bridge in time. A little bit of work done frequently over time and we’ll get you there. **But you will not do book reports and science projects and other things on your own**. You can’t. Those involve delays. And you can’t handle delays. So the best way to solve the problem is get rid of the delay and bring it back into the now through little steps. Break all long term projects into baby steps, do a baby step a day, you get there. And if you don’t do that, they’re not doing it.  You have to make motivation external. **They can’t create internal motivation**. They are dependent on the environment for their motivation. **You must put the consequences in the now or they will not work for you**. This is what video games do and what homework does not. Which is why they can play video games for hours and not do their homework for more than a few minutes. Video games provide external continuous reinforcement. Homework does nothing. Video games do not need internal motivation whereas homework does. So **you’ve got to create motivation**. You’re going to start to have to make a deal with your kids. What’s in it for them? What are you putting in it for them? What are you creating? What’s the reward? What’s the points what’s the token? What’s the sex the drugs and the money? Whatever it is, you’re going to have to negotiate a deal. **There has to be a consequence or it isn’t going to get done.**  You have to **make problem solving manual**. Remember **they cannot do mental manipulations like other people**. This is why they can’t do digit span backwards, but **it has nothing to do with digit span**. They can’t hold things in mind and move them around as well as other people. So don’t make them do it. Put it in their hands. If they have a math problem to solve, **provide marbles**, **a number line**, an **abacus**, a **calculator**. Let them do the problem manually or at least assist the mental problem solving with manual pieces to it.  It’s the principal that matters people you can come up with lots of ideas here.  And then finally and this is the most important, the executive system has a limited fuel tank. **And you can spend it out real quick**. Every time you use an executive function and you use it continuously, you **empty the tank**. And if you get to the bottom of the tank in the next situation, you will have no self-control. This is the ADHD child after school. Gone. And you want to do homework? You’re out of your mind. So you’ve got to refuel that tank and that tank has a very limited capacity.  So, how do we refuel the tank? Interestingly there are lots of things we have discovered to boost the tank. The use of **rewards** and **positive emotions**. The use of **self-statements of effectiveness**. I can do this, I know I can do this. This is the locker room talk before the game and it helps to boost motivation. In addition to that, you need to take 10 minute breaks very often, indeed more often. **You need to break tasks down into smaller units and take frequent breaks**. And during those breaks a little relaxation and meditation helps to refuel the tank. Stop using the executive system for a few minutes and give it a chance to restore its fuel tank. This is why we talk about the 10 and 3 rule with ADHD children. 10 minutes of work, 3 minutes of break. 10 and 3, 10 and 3. But you can’t do more than 10, you’re starting to empty the tank. Give them a chance to refuel the tank.  **What does this say about keeping kids in for recess when they don’t get all their homework done? You just shot yourself in the foot**. And that leads me to the next thing, visually and talking about the future rewards will help you boost the tank. And so does physical exercise. Routine aerobic exercise boosts the tank, refuels it and creates a bigger tank. Everybody with ADHD should be involved in an exercise program. Research shows it benefits this disorder better than any other psychiatric disorder. And now you know why, it helps to refuel that tank.  And finally, the fuel in the tank is **sugar in the bloodstream in the frontal lobe**. Blood glucose in the frontal lobe is directly correlated with executive abilities. What does that mean? If you have an extensive task involving your executive brain, like an exam that you have to do, you better be sipping on some lemonade or a Gatorade or a sports drink. Sipping not gulping. **You’re going to have to keep your blood sugar way up so that you keep this fuel tank partially restored**. So this is the opposite of what people once thought. **Sugar hurts people with ADHD, no it does not and never did**. But it may well help them if it’s in fluid form that can get into the brain very quickly. You’ve got to keep that blood glucose up. Those are the things you can do to boost the fuel tank.  There are various approaches on the market for adults and college students with ADHD that incorporate these ideals. Russell Ramsay program, which is cognitive behavioral therapy, does a pretty good job of it. I’m not going to go through this with you. Steven Safren’s program, even better because it’s based on this model of executive functioning. So Steve talks about what you can do to boost executive functioning in adults who are on medication but they have to be on medication. And the most recent one that came out is the most heavily executive in nature. It is Mary Solanto’s program for training executive functioning in adults with ADHD. These are the 3 tested programs that have been shown to boost medication effects in adults with ADHD and all of them target those deficits in the executive brain as part of their models.  So what have you learned today? You’ve learned that **ADHD is not an attention disorder**. You’ve learned that **it’s an executive disorder and the executive system is a very complex multilevel system** like driving. It is not one level of cognition and that’s all it is. It’s multilevel, **its complex and it extends into our daily lives**. You know that ADHD disrupts that system through behavioral inhibition and wiping out all the other executive abilities which puts you at risk for failing in your executive activities in your daily life. **People with ADHD have problems in all dimensions of executive functioning in their daily life** and that is going to lead them to great difficulty in getting along with other people, building a friendship, networks, cooperation, subordinating their interests to others. All of the things in life that involve executive functioning. From money management, to driving, to friendships, to families and so on are at grave risk in this disorder because they all depend on this executive system.  So we’re going to have to help people with ADHD, build the scaffolding around them and use the medication of neurogenic therapy with them in order to compensate for these executive deficits. We’re going have to design a prosthetic environment around them. You **know the beauty of ADHD is it’s the most treatable disorder in psychiatry**. There is no disorder that we treat that has as many medications and this many psychosocial treatments that are as effective as these are for as many people producing more change than any other medications in psychosocial treatments for these individuals. Do you know that **55%** of people on medication are normalized? **90%** of them respond. Do you know **the effects of ADHD medication are three times that of anxiety drugs and antidepressants** that you all give away like candy in your practice? We have huge effective drugs on our hands that we can use and we also have very effective psychosocial interventions. This is the most treatable disorder that we face. **The biggest problem is, most people don’t get treatment**. **40%** of children and **90%** of adults with ADHD are not recognized or treated for their disorder. That’s the problem, **not that we’re over treating, but that we’re under treating**. And we’re **under treating the most treatable disorder in psychiatry**."  &#x200B;

Why can't I just do my work? Why does it take me longer to THINK about doing my work rather than actually DOING it? Why can my friends finish their work in two hours? Why can't I do that? And man don't even get me started on online school. the zoom meetings are not beneficial to me, reading isn't either, everything goes in one ear and out the other, words never get absorbed. I hate having ADD and the struggles that it comes with.  Edit: thank you so much for all of the kind comments. It makes me feel SO much better that other people can relate to this because I don't have anyone to talk to about this (or at least people who will understand this).  I currently have been off medication since May, and i'm very hesitant to take it again. After not taking it for a few days or even a week, I will get terrible migraines taking it again. So I really can't imagine how bad the pain will be after not taking it for about 6 months. My medication also doesn't make me feel so well throughout the day taking it (dry mouth, which results in bad breath, sweating, very fast heart beat, upset stomach, no appetite) but I think i'm willing to feel uncomfortable for 8hrs a day instead of failing my junior year of high school.

9ceeb186b62acf3ea74cfddec7b625146ae169615bb19756333f76883a29b2e0;;;Getting off social media was the best thing I have ever done for my mental health;;;TLDR; deactivated facebook, made new Instagram that is solely for posting progress on my main hobby... I have *so much* more time and dopamine because I'm not mindlessly looking at anxiety-inducing crap.   About a month ago, I made a post on my social media saying I was taking a break. Shortly Afterwards, I deactivated facebook, made a new Instagram solely for rollerskating progress (my main hobby), and I customized my reddit feed to be centered around my hobbies, interests, and enjoyment. I avoid the front page.   My dudes, let me tell you. Hours of my day have been given back because I'm not getting lost in other people's drama, other people's lives... Blah blah. I still keep up with what's going on in the world, but it's *so much easier* to "switch off". I don't feel attached to my phone anymore.   Not comparing my life to that of my family, friends, and acquaintances (because let's face it, we do this whether we realize it or not) has been the single most freeing thing I've done. Besides choosing to ditch the bra. But I digress.   Thanks for reading  **EDIT**:: I am very much aware that Reddit is social media. Maybe a more appropriate title would have been "limiting my social media presence and removing triggering/toxic content and/or people is the best thing I've done for my mental health" but that's a little too wordy IMO.   That being said, sometimes we just gotta be contrarian lil bitches and point out semantic flaws with no filter so like, I get it. Lol.  EDIT numero dos:: this got more attention than I expected and I will never respond to all the comments but omg thank u for the support and the stories! You guys rock.
d169af73f0880d106995caa81d8c3a84b9e9ab0ad1425563f98a11453e9b610f;;;your childhood pain is real. don’t let anybody try to tell you otherwise.;;;hi all! I just stumbled upon this video: [ADHD Child vs. Non-ADHD Child Interview](https://youtu.be/-IO6zqIm88s) and I sorta started sobbing. For those of y’all who don’t have the time/energy to watch the video: two 6-year-old kids (one with ADHD and one without it) are asked questions about how they feel about themselves, their performance in school, their social lives, etc. Anybody with ADHD can IMMEDIATELY tell that that little girl is the child with ADHD. She describes herself as feeling lonely, being bullied by others, feeling like she’s an average student despite getting As, and feeling like she’s a bad child. The video ends with a message saying that children with ADHD also usually suffer from other mental health problems like depression and anxiety. The combination of what she was describing closely resembling what I experienced as a child and the fact that she kinda looks like I did when I was her age just sorta broke me a bit and I started crying. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 6 but I wasn’t diagnosed with depression and anxiety (despite showing VERY clear symptoms of it as a child) until I had entered high school. I have never once in my life felt like I’m a good person, that I’m pretty, or that I fit in with people socially. Whenever I tried to bring up the fact that I had been showing depressive/anxious symptoms since childhood, my mother (a non-ADHD person) brushed it off and got annoyed whenever I would make jokes about being a bad child. However, after watching that video and speaking to my best friend since preschool, I know that I wasn’t making up the way I felt. I KNOW what I felt as a child and I KNOW that I didn’t receive the proper emotional support from my parents despite their best efforts.  I don’t really know where I was going with this but I just want ANYBODY struggling with processing their childhood memories to know that: you are not crazy, you are not alone, your pain was/is real and valid. You are loved and what you experienced wasn’t your fault. Please just remember that.

So I thought we could stop scrolling together!   There’s probably something you need to do: sleep, send that email, finish that assignment, make that appointment, call someone, put the wet clothes in the dryer before you go to sleep, set up for tomorrow, organize for work/school, and many other tasks I feel like we easily forget about or get distracted from.   Okay so 3, 2, 1, and go do the thing! :D I’m going to sleep.  Edit: Holy shit lol I legit posted on mobile, locked my phone, and popped my socket back in, and went to bed and I wake up to 700+ upvotes and 50+ comments? (‘: And here I was about to say fuck it and not go to the first day of school but you know what? I will attend Ecology that starts in 4 minutes! BATTLE STATIONS!!!   Oh and thank you guys so much for the awards. I didn’t expect this to blow up like it did.

But then my boss came in and immediately started accusing me and someone else of things that we did not do, and then complained about how I didn't get "more important things done"  Honestly for the past 2 days this has just crushed me. Like I thought I was doing well only to be yelled at for something else. It shouldn't matter to me but I've lost all motivation to even try because what's the fucking point.  I'm apart of a team and no one else on the team was yelled at about this. It was just me. I'm so depressed about it I don't even want to go to work. I hate feeling like this so much. I obsess over these things and ultimately it destroys me emotionally. I feel like I have no support system because no one sees how much it hurts me because on the surface it just seems like its not that big of a deal and I should get over it.  I really want a hug from someone but I really have no one to talk to. I feel so alone.  &#x200B;  EDIT: I don't know how many people will see this edit but I want to thank every one for the support. I was feeling very low when I wrote this and now I am tearing up for a completely different reason; the amount of support and love I feel right now is overwhelming. This is a fantastic community and I really appreciate all of you for being here for me when I was so far down.

I thought I had ADHD for a long time but i actually have had undiagnosed celiacs disease. Now that my executive function is returning, I can see how hard you all have it. My brain WAS NOT the same as a normal brain, and if you felt anything like me then your probably working harder than anyone else on the planet to keep up. I cannot explain to you guys the difference. Granted there were different causes, but I experienced many of the same side effects, forgetfulness, brain fog, emotional dysregulation, difficulty completing tasks and horrible diarrhea (kidding, that's just me). It was just so hard you guys. It was so so so hard. I have never understood why I have failed to thrive. Mornings were always hard, no routine, difficulty waking up, difficulty with motivation and now all of that is gone. I just cant express how sad I am for everyone who is ever told that they are lazy or unmotivated. FUCK THAT NOISE! I seriously couldnt have been trying harder and the pressure from my parents wrecked my self esteem. Things are just so much easier now. I just gradually stopped relying on my alarms, I stopped having to write things down, I stopped having to use GPS to get everywhere it's just so much better. I wish it was as easy of a fix for all of you as eating bread. I dont mean to brag about feeling better, but I'm just crying today over how fucking invalidated I've felt my whole life for not having any executive function. I cant even imagine what you all go through.  Either way, just know I know how hard you guys are working. This is probably one of the hardest working groups of people on the planet.  Edit: Thank you to everyone who congratulated me and shared their stories. I love this sub and I love how accepting everyone is.

He started nervous laughing and said yes.  I told him okay do as I say okay, I told him to put me on loud speaker and put his phone on his desk and make sure he can hear me.   He said okay he was so confused.  Then I said okay now I want you to pick up all the dishes and cups in your room and bring them down stairs he started laughing and actually did it.  Then I said now make your bed it doesn’t have to be neat but just make it. He did it too.   Then I said now put all your dirty clothes in your laundry basket, but instead he did one better and put them in the washer! Longish story short I helped him clean his room with no distractions because I know when he has his phone in his hand he will be distracted and start looking at other things.   He manage to clean his room, do his laundry and now he’s happy. We’re in a long distance relationship so it the best I can do to help and I guess it really did work as he got it done and now calls me whenever he feels like he needs to clean his room 😂🤟🏽
84aa91bb930f39dd7ec62168e94c07a4eb0d1188f023d4a38a0a91762701dc0f;;;I’m SO HAPPYYY I found my keys after a full 5 days. Big relief , now I can finally leave my apartment to get food because god knows how long I’ve been starving;;;About 5 days ago I wanted to go leave my apartment to go get groceries , when it struck it where are my keys. I have a designated place for my essential stuff when I leave (wallet, phone, keys and earphones) . If something is not at that designated area I don’t know where it is. So I was stuck in my apartment for 5 days , with barely any groceries and I couldn’t even leave to get any groceries . I have finals going on as well so didn’t get much time to look for it as I didn’t have any plans of leave my apartment other than for grocery, which I was fine with not getting because I fast for 30 straight days in a month once a year so my body is used to it. My roommates are also not here so I couldn’t borrow their keys either. Anyways, just like an hour ago while writing my statistics final exam , it clicked. I remembered in the middle of the fricking exam where the keys are . The question on the assessment was talking about geese , which reminded me of winter , which in turn reminded me of the new winter jacket I got which has a small pocket for stuff like keys etc. I ran to my closet and put my hands into that pocket and as soon I felt the keys, there was this moment. This moment of realization that I was correct, that I remembered where I kept them. I laughed because my ADHD brain got me into the trouble, and that same brain got me out of it. Now I’m about to head out to get some McDonald’s , ah I’m so hungry I cannot wait. Sorry if this is to long have an amazing week guys take care stay hydrated, byeee  Ps- the exam went really well !!!  Edit 1: THANK YOU FOR THE AWARD <3 and i edited some grammar. This community is really amazing, im so happy to be a part of this subreddit. The support is so unconditional 😭❤️ . Thank you so much again everyone.
e4def5e7b6ff2ca5485fb074369972f50696b155de47efc8ac512eeab6343808;;;I got called into the office at my new job today.;;;I got my first full time/legit job since being medicated over a year ago; I started a week and a half ago, today I got called into the office, when I walk in my boss looks at me straight faced and asks "what are we going to do with you?" Well, if you're ADHD this is a familiar talk, and it doesn't ever go well...........I don't say anything because that always makes it worse, he says "it's obvious we're underpaying you, how about a $3 raise and we'll assess you in another 3 months for another $3.  Uh....What?
51f9866de3820a4a65de22d888ac0310dc915981a3d7eb4a4757611927796532;;;Stop comparing your achievements to those of neurotypicals. You have to work twice as hard just to get to their starting point. Be proud of what you manage.;;;I’m on a phased return to work, after being off for over a year. I hadn’t been diagnosed with ADHD and the uncontrolled symptoms were making it very difficult for me to stay in work. My depression and anxiety were in overdrive.   A year of therapy, daily doses of Elvanse and a whole lot of self-reflection, I’m up to around 20 hours a week, 6 months into my return.   It’s very hard not to beat myself up. My partner is always so proud of me after a good day or good week in work. He tells me I’m amazing and inspirational. I always felt like he was patronising me and I couldn’t be proud of myself. I couldn’t accept the praise.   I challenged him on it, saying I didn’t understand why he was so proud when he works full time and it’s so easy. He pointed out that my brain makes it very difficult me to do a lot of the things neurotypical people do easily on a daily basis. I’ve had to overcome a lot of obstacles most people never even consider.   The fact that I’ve fought so hard and am STILL fighting is something to be proud of. A year ago, I couldn’t even leave the house most days. All the steps required to leave were just too overwhelming. Now I’m in work most days, showered, wearing clean clothes, even makeup! I’m productive, enjoying my work and feeling positive about the future.   I still struggle to be proud of myself, but I’m getting better. I have so much to be proud of and so do you.   Did you manage to go shower this morning? AWESOME. Made a home cooked meal? YOU ROCK. Lay in bed all day to rest? WELL DONE FOR LOOKING AFTER YOURSELF.   Comparing ourselves to neurotypicals all the time will only make us feel like failures, more overwhelmed and less hopeful.   We face so much more than most every day and we’re still here. Be proud.

Yeah, dopamine, the ‘feel good’ hormone. My brains normal state is feeling somewhere between ‘really shitty’ and ‘not quite right’ on the comfort and happiness meter. This causes my brain to uncontrollably look for sources of dopamine through distraction and/or action, and also causes uncontrollable dis-regulation of my emotions. There are many other symptoms, and all can vary between different people. It is constant and ever-present to varying degrees. It can be treated primarily with medication, but lifestyle, diet and exercise can also have minor positive effects. It cannot be cured.”    Edit: Gold, Wow! Um.. Thanks kind stranger?  I know there’s a lot in there that’s not necessarily scientifically accurate but if we’re trying to explain to everyday people, I think/hope this is a good way to get the main points across and give people a much better understanding as quickly as possible.   As an aside, if the ‘ADHD’ term has already been broached, I also like to start with something like “Yep ADHD, and it’s nothing like what you think, it has nothing to do with mis-behaving kids It’s incredibly *under* diagnosed, affecting up to 15% of all people.”   Edit 2: thanks for the kind words. You guys are my people. :)

a88f14076bbb204e3ee0531cd7299637fabce4ec6cae490f8e4330d98909bdd6;;;i don’t think we talk enough about how traumatizing school is/was for us;;;i don’t think we talk enough about how traumatizing school is/was for a lot of us  there are so many things i could put here, but here are some of the highlights  the fact that i got scolded or screamed at what felt like nearly every day for yEARS  the fact that i struggled so badly for so long and absolutely no one took my concerns seriously  the fact that i was always the last person to finish any quiz/exam/standardized test, i always used all of the time i was given (i still think it’s strange that other people didn’t) and even then on several occasions i wasn’t able to finish even though i knew the material  the fact that i routinely had to have meetings with my teachers about those exams and i tried to explain to them that i knew all the answers, but i just ran out of time, and if i had some more time to work i could have finished, and getting an ‘aw that’s too bad’ in response  BUT even when i did finish, i ended up making ‘careless mistakes’ even after reading each question multiple times to make sure i knew what it was asking and checking every answer multiple times (this was especially true for math, and any time we were allowed to use a calculator, i had to do the simplest calculations (like 2+2) multiple times to make sure they were correct  the fact that other people could finish simple in class assignments in like 10 mins but i almost always had to take the work home to finish it, adding to my mountain of homework  the fact that i felt like i had to work so much harder as everyone else to get decent grades  the fact that all of the above and many other things have absolutely destroyed my self esteem and my sense of self  disclaimer: i’m writing this super late and i’m very tired so i’m sorry if it doesnt really make sense
d296b0d612dd066ef5ea508d4e62a28cc00d4b365ee72a17ac1dc80f75ad5a47;;;And that's why you ALWAYS leave a note...;;;Guys, he left a note. HE LEFT ME A NOTE.   My husband is a freak of nature where he can remember things without setting alarms, or without writing things down, or without tracing and retracing his steps over and over again. So he has a very difficult time understanding how my brain works.   The past few years, my brain has been in overdrive (ADHD + severe mom brain) so I cannot remember anything. Things I'm supposed to do every day, or something that may seem routine to most people, is a HUGE chore for me to remember. I'm constantly forgetting to do things and my husband blames this on a lack of communication, but it's honestly I just. can't. remember.   Queue summer. We have a pool. Typically my husband is in charge of pool maintenance, but since I work from home (especially now), he relies on me to turn on the pump or do some small daily tasks that may need to be done. We have been at each other's throats because I have forgotten to turn on the pump for the filter quite frequently. Which then in turn, turns the pool green. Well since i have 700000 other things flying through my brain, I didn't think to add it to my list. So he tells me that I should "just know this stuff after 3 years" and then I suggested sending me a text when something needs to be done as a reminder. He says that he's busy and can't always do that.   Well guys, I woke up to a note today. "Turn the pump on at 10am! Love you!"   He has never once written me a reminder note. Guys, I think he's starting to understand that I'm not just ignoring him or purposely forgetting things. He wants to help me!  **Edit:** Wow! This is my first successful Reddit post ever and I'm glad that it's part of an Arrested Development reference :) Thanks everyone for the replies and comments, I assure you that I've read them all, I wish I could reply to them all! And thank you kind stranger for the gold!   Quick update: I made hubby an awesome dinner last night and told him how much it meant that he was trying to help me and that I think we're a great team and all that great stuff. Then the kids went to bed and we had more fun.   Also, we just started using a shared calendar, so the notes and reminders will continue and we will get into a rhythm, this is just the beginning!   Finally, the pump WILL be automated as soon as we can get this last piece delivered. We are adding a heater this year, so we are redoing all of the electric around the pump/filter to make it more efficient and safer for the kids!

I feel so overwhelmed with my responsibilities (you know, the ones everyone has...) yet i can not for the life of me stay interested in anything for longer than a few hours before getting bored and fidgety/daydreamy.   When people then ask me why im overwhelmed and if theres anything they can help me with, i sit back and think about it and realize my life isn’t that busy but hey i still feel burned out for no reason whatsoever lmao fuck i need to go do some work now
791b369f6f5c188d1e9cbd734bf1295837757b85f23c4591c7e13e0c0338f065;;;A humble thank you;;;I want to start by saying I don't have ADHD. I joined this community to gain a better understanding of people diagnosed with ADHD. I've taken tips, tricks, and strategies from the posts in order to help my students. There was a time in my life I thought people with ADHD were just lazy and undisciplined. Your stories have helped lift the veil of ignorance and helped me find more empathetic footing.  I know that there are varying views on medication in the community and my own views used to lean towards the negative side. Why can't my students just learn to do the work on their own? Why do they need to rely on medication? Someone posted (and I've read several echoes) about how the medication levels the playing-field. It doesn't give you any unfair advantage, it just takes away the disadvantages you've been playing with.  Last night my husband and I were talking. He's been self-medicating with drugs and alcohol for years. He's been afraid to start medication because he thinks he should be able to do it in his own. Because of this community, I convinced him to talk to his therapist about medication. We discussed how  it won't be a cure all, it will take time to find the right medication and dosage. And we'll continue to develop his coping strategies, but it's my hope the strategies he's already using will be more successful and long-lasting.  I just wanted to thank you all for sharing your stories. You've helped me become a better teacher and advocate for my students. And you've helped me become a better partner to my husband.  :edit: thank you for the silver! It's my first!  ::edit:: thank you for your kind words and continued advice! And thank you for the numerous awards!
bebbc58ea8e8a1144fd0ca1ccf2b36c4e00a5d1a73eddb119b089dfe35fd3f97;;;Finally diagnosed, apparently im not a lazy failure and i cleaned my room and;;;24 years of living under the "spacey, lazy, but very smart. what a shame" label, i finally realized something was wrong beyond just lazy after spending two years trying to get my life in order and trying to develop my skillset and failing miserably.  i finally went to a therapist, who diagnosed me with adhd-i. ive started medication and today i cleaned my room. a two day ordeal took me two hours, i put everything where it actually belongs and not just stashed out of sight. i didn't get antsy or distracted at all, i didnt even realize id been going for two hours until i was done. it sent my family into shock.  when i was done i cried. i cried so so much, i was overwhelmed with joy and relief, the simplest tasks had always been a struggle, but today i just did it. and i did it well.  EDIT: i made this post just bc i wanted to share that tiny moment of victory with someone, i didnt expect to be so overwhelmed with support :") the post is literally getting out of hand and i cant keep up but thank you all so so much for your positive support and sharing your experiences as well, i have never felt so not-alone in my entire life
33e7e7f049a465ff73b1e03903922ae1ab2e7e99655790e9fcc8ec5bd1248e5a;;;I started college in 1988 and I finished yesterday;;;I had many re-starts, went to many different colleges, took many breaks, but the deed is done.    The last couple of weeks I would have little moments of awareness that I was finally going to finish and I would get butterflies in my stomach. It's become almost surreal.    I feel very conflicted about it. I'm really proud for not only graduating, but graduating from Washington University in Saint Louis. It's a kind of tough school and I struggled many times and almost quit many times.    I also feel a little foolish celebrating because it took me 31 years to do it. I was going to pass on the whole walking in my robes but my wife convinced me I should. I agreed because I didn't want to regret it later in life and I couldn't go back and redo it. But I'm definitely going to feel awkward. (TBH I feel awkward most of the time)    I keep hearing a lot of praise from people and thought I should share it here if it helps someone else like me or just someone who is thinking of quitting.    I was diagnosed with ADHD three years ago an I'm pretty sure it had a lot to do with me not finding the motivation to finish sooner. But I did it  Edit: Holy crow. I posted this last night and went to bed  and just woke up. Sorry if anyone thought I was ignoring you. I just found this sub a few weeks ago and have been lurking. It really made me feel better seeing so many stories that I could relate with. I wanted to share mine so that it might help a few people. Getting gold and silver is cool, getting upvotes is even better. But what I appreciate the most is getting comments and you guys are awesome. The positivity is overwhelming and I just don't know what to think right now. Cheers to everyone. Dealing with this condition is kind of tough, but I think this sub is really going to make a difference to a lot of people. Rock on peeps.  Edit #2: I just went through and tried to respond to every comment. If I missed someone I apologize. but I got a 3 year old telling me that I have done enough internet today and it's time to go out and play. I'm so glad I found this sub, you guys are awesome and this has been one of the most wholesome things I have experienced. One thing I've learned since being here is that there are a lot of us going through the same things and we are not alone.
d42b840b3df06a4d21c979360c1f63bdde4a970a03879b5dd58f2fb311520832;;;To my husband...;;;I'm sorry for losing my patience when we dont leave on time. I'm sorry for getting frustrated when you have a hard time making decisions. I'm sorry for giving you the annoyed look when you interrupt me to tell me something you remembered just so you won't forget. I'm sorry for ever acting/mentioning you act "different" when you're on your medicine. I'm sorry for not being more understanding, and supporting you like I should. I was someone who didn't take ADHD as serious as I should have, and I am so sorry for that. Thank you for sharing the videos and links to help me further understand- have more of an insight and would genuinely like to apologize for any stress that I have caused you in the past. We are opposites in a lot of ways, but I fell in love with you for you, and that will never change.  I know you browse this subreddit, and hope this makes it to you.

I'm so happy I finally get to tell you guys, fuck every teacher who tried to fuck me over until now. Fuck my psychologist for refusing to diagnose me. Fuck people looking down on us.  I love you guys and I will keep fighting for you, especially and hopefully during my career in the future.

But going to a really "good" college and succeeding in four years, despite not having been diagnosed nor medicated properly until SENIOR FALL, is a huge win for me. I often struggle with feeling I'm not capable, or good enough, because of my poor attention skills and slack work ethic (or whatever). The fact that I was able to complete my degree is insane to me. So many all-nighters and last minute projects.. Terrible attendance and tardiness... A fucking pandemic... Dealing with depression, and anxiety, and grieving.. Financial stress.. Family issues.. ADHD, which affects each one of these factors.. I'm super proud of myself today.  &#x200B;  EDIT: Statistic from study posted in comments. Not sure about the accuracy of the info because I didn't research in-depth, but take it with a grain of salt.

28aea3250bbd88ff5ad4b02c2aa92212239cc24e64195c320fe01e6fb5feb5dc;;;I watched my son hyperfocus for the first time yesterday;;;My son, almost nine, is about as ADHD as you can get.  He's a hyper, emotional and hilarious little string bean of a boy who hates school work like any kid and hates remote learning even more.  He's sat there for hours before trying to translate a math lesson to paper, and we have to constantly remind him to stay on task or go back and fix his handwriting.  After a long, almost excruciating day of remote learning, my son decided to find a book about Japanese words on his schools digital library. He's been really interested in the country lately.  Two hours later the kid has the *most organized and clean layout I've ever seen him make* with English words on the left and Japanese pronunciations and writing on the right.    Yesterday I saw the classic "if you would put as much effort in to your homework as you do your interests.." moment that I had heard so many times from my parents.  I saw myself and my hobbies as a kid and adult, overtaking any current interests I had and enveloping my thoughts and time. Hell, even as an adult I have hobbies that can consume me for hours on end.     It warmed my heart seeing him grow intellectually, but terrified me because I know what's to come when high school rolls around.  It was really neat to see him like me in a way that doesn't make me feel ashamed of my ADHD.  It's something that he can use and utilize for his own interests and hopefully someday maybe a livelihood. Maybe not writing random foreign language words down, but another passion that he's found.
d0755b926a521acb0958d71fa41e10ee5edca82975b34affb12a9cf6f88144e0;;;I see several posts on those struggling inside their own head. If you haven't heard of Dr. Russell Barkley, do yourself a favor and give his work a read/listen.;;;I have spent the majority of my life struggling, learning, and adapting to deficits in executive functioning. Most of the time, it was struggling to realize that the way that I am is not a disadvantage. I was given a diagnosis of ADHD at a young age, however was withheld medication until my early university years.  I could give you my life story, how/when I realized I needed help... however, there's plenty of that in this subreddit, and let's be real. No one here has the attention span to sit through a long-winded post. See what I did there?  Dr. Russell Barkley is a clinical professor of psychiatry out of VCU Medical School. He's been involved in research & a psychiatrist since the early '70s. Most of his work revolves around ADHD and related fields spanning into childhood years. He's written 27 books on these topics, and has published nearly 300 peer reviewed, scholarly research articles.  His work helped change my perspective, and I hope it can help even a single person here.  I've attached an incredibly abridged video presentation of some of his work in an attempt to get some of you to do more digging into his, and other's, research. He's devoted his life work to us. Please give yourself the pleasure of listening to him.    [Dr. Russell Barkley - ADHD](https://youtu.be/_tpB-B8BXk0)  Edit: I've gotten a few DMs, and I'm glad people are enjoying this. I read through this sub daily & see a lot of people posting about how happy they are to complete their goal for the day, and that is amazing! I'm very happy for all of you taking steps in the right direction.... I just want to help you bridge the gap to longer term tasks and goals.

Understands that my messiness isn’t due to laziness or for lack of trying to be tidy. Comforts and helps me when i get frustrated with myself for not being able to find my hairbrush (for the 8th time that day) because I left it on top of the microwave, in the cupboard, etc etc etc. Doesn’t mind driving all the time because it’s safer for us. Reminds me to call friends and family back and on their birthdays / holidays. Treats me with politeness and care when I ask the same questions over and over. Understands that I try my best and still sometimes suffer.   TLDR: partner is amazing and is the key to feeling like I can live with what goes on in my brain. 10/10 would recommend this strategy when choosing a lifelong mate.  Edit: clarity  Edit 2: holy cow, so much love! I’m making my way to the responses. This community is so helpful ❤️
b2ddf75477cd049c130756fd2a55f181a469f3b5bc5853e23b5ec53cfbd35a5d;;;Last Year I got Medicated, THIS YEAR I GOT MY FIRST 6 FIGURE JOB AT 23!!!!!!!!;;;Hey Gang! Long time lurker, first time poster.  I was diagnosed with ADHD-C in October of last year and am on Strattera (90mg - most of the proper stimulants gave me horrible anxiety and I went 3 days without sleep on Adderall at one point).   On Monday of this week I accepted an offer for a six-figure position for my dream job in IT AT 23!  TL;DR Backstory: Got entry level government job out of high school, worked my way up, just landed new 6 figure position at 23!   Full Backstory:  While I was unmedicated and had just finished high school I landed a really super entry level casual job in a State Government agency in my hometown. Five years of working my way up and really super duper hyper focusing on my career (kinda was scared of being considered a “loser” because I barely made it through high school) I just was offered and I accepted a 6 figure IT role at 23!  Just wanted to take a second to thank each and every one of you guys for the kind words of encouragement and support we all share with each other in this subreddit! It’s truly a beautiful corner of the Internet to be a part of 🥺!   You’re all such great people! I think with a bit of hard work, determination and dedication we can all be where we want to be in our careers and in our lives. Our condition(s) might make that journey a bit more rocky on the way but we just gotta keep on, keeping on 😊!  **Fact of the day: You can do it buddy!**  Keep striving guys, you got this 👏🏽🙌🏽 !!!!
bdd6e08f97c22893b1ea5cc93d069ca34544184e9150e0f9f2906617b436e989;;;I’m thinking my relationships follow along the same lines as my hobbies: Jack of all trades, master of none; friend of all, best of none;;;I’ve seen so many posts about people being interested in a million different things/hobbies/careers that they’re never able to really be good at one or even start most of them (and I totally relate to all that)  But I’ve been wondering if that feeling applies to the people in my life as well  There are so many friends from the different places I’ve lived that i want to keep being friends with and that I miss dearly! There are so many friends and family members that I want to keep up with and know what’s going on in their lives. And yet, I’m really close with almost no one.  I’ve never been anyone’s best friend except my (now ex) long term boyfriend, who I think I sort of hyperfocused on for the middle part of our relationship  But I so desperately want a best friend. I want someone to tell me about themselves and the struggles they’re going through and I want someone I don’t feel bad about telling my struggles to  And yet I also want to stay friends with so many people and completely struggle to keep up with those friendships  And yeah I’ve seen the comments where people kindly finish the phrase to say “jack of all trades, master of none is better than a master of one” (or however it’s exactly worded) but I’m not so sure that I can apply that to relationships. It seems rather important to have a few very close relationships
6401fee49fe85c67e64d22d7bf86641647cd4e9ebb84131f1fcf23232ce4e890;;;i have two brain cells and they both have anxiety;;;i was in the shower basically freaking out thinking about all the things i had to do today and how i had no idea how i was going to get everything done.  i got out and wrote everything down immediately. here’s the list:  - do laundry - clean bathroom - study  after writing everything down, i look at it and realize how insane i truly am. 3 whole things???? are u kidding???? im freaking out wondering how im going to finish THREE TASKS??? now watch me sit here forever because i feel like im forgetting something and not start anything until the last minute because of it. im tired of myself honestly.  edit: update - i didnt think this would get that much attention... thank u to all who came w advice. i did have things broken down into sub tasks but bc the general tasks wouldnt take that long (besides probably the laundry), i left the subtasks out since i didnt think all of adhd reddit would make it through my personal to do list lol.... anyways the update is that i took a nap instead and still havent started any of these lol... it will be okay though.
2ac34450291d1bb6c7bfe08089cb812cda51c4235f4be159227e2266eabf5604;;;30, no degree, officially diagnosed as Inattentive/Hyperactive. The most income I made before 2020 was around $60,000.00. In 2020, my total gross income was $104,000.00, more than what my husband and I made COMBINED in 2019.;;;At 21, I started at the current company I work for as a temp receptionist. Luckily, I was hired on as a full-time employee. Before then, I was hopping jobs and couldn't keep a steady income due to my issues with undiagnosed ADHD.   At 23, I was promoted to loan processor. I sat there at my desk so many hours wondering why I could not complete the tasks that needed to be completed and I was so worried I was broken. I thought I was going to lose my job. I felt inadequate and like a total failure.  Luckily, a co-worker who sat across from me (who also has the same type of ADHD as I do) saw that I was struggling. She suspected that I had ADHD and suggested for me to see a doctor about it. Best life-changing decision I've ever made.  All this time I thought something was wrong with me. I thought I was broken and stupid.  This November will mark 10 years since I was hired there. I am currently a Sr. Loan Processor and one of the top performers at my branch and I love my job. With no degree, I have a fulfilling career and I am able to provide for my family.  I will always be forever grateful to that co-worker. She really changed my life and I'd probably still be job-hopping right now with no career path or any sort of direction if it weren't for her. I had always joked about being ADHD (I know, terrible) but never looked into it seriously and I had never thought to be checked by a doctor until we crossed paths, and I'm so glad I did.   In hindsight, it explains a lot of my failures and struggles and it is painful to think about what could have been. Maybe I would've finished school with a degree? Maybe my husband and I wouldn't have had to struggle all those years. But I try to keep moving forward. No point in thinking of what could've been! Oh, and my husband also has ADHD but only Inattentive. He's been through the same struggles as I have due to his undiagnosed ADHD at that time.  He is considering going back to school full-time because of the guaranteed income I have and I am so, so grateful. And he's going to kill it because he's now officially diagnosed and medicated. Sorry for the long post!!! I'm riding high right now haha.  ***Edit: I apologize if this came across as a show-off post. I posted this in hopes of helping inspire people who are on the fence about getting officially diagnosed and treated. Nobody should have to go through the hell we went through. If I can save someone the years of failure and heartbreak, that is what matters.***
f00c26cac0206216a137e62f14c8621e945725a669ab220c19c2eb4344ac303c;;;Why does everything feel like a chore;;;Even on meds, it's like turning on a button to start moving and "here we go again", the feeling stays the same.  Replying to messages, recharging headphones or mouses or whatever, even getting to my desk seems to take up so much mental energy  I think it doesn't help that we're all in lockdown and can't have a change of scenery to recalibrate

dc937b59892604f5a86ac96936cd7ff09e25f18ae6b758e8014a24c7fa039e91;;;When you realise that you were not popular and people actually found you annoying as a kid...;;;I thought i was super popular and everyone liked me cause i talked to me and they interacted and gave attention to me a lot! I thought we were good friends!!!   I was so childish that at 11 years old when i spoke to someone for like 2 months... i thought we were bestfriends and i even made a birthday card for them saying happy birthday best friend! They did not feel the same...  I thought people liked me. But just because everyone knows who you are, doesent mean that you are popular. I moved to a new school and when i saw the way these kids were treating another new kid, i realised that i was actually being bullied.  They spoke to him and made him talk a lot, pretending to be nice but they laughed at his actions behind his back and were mean. They made him do things that they found funny, it was funny to them that he thought they were friends.  My old classmates, they didnt like me, they spoke to me and interacted with me as a joke. As a way to make fun. We werent best friends, they misled me and used me as a joke.   I was annoying and they actually hated me. They all went out but never invited me out. That was already a huge warning sign. It did not help that i was atleast 2 years younger than everyone else.  I only had a few close friends... but everyone else hated me, i just wanted to be popular! I literally remember bragging to my family that i was popular... but just because they talk to you, doesent mean you are friends.

You're screaming and shouting at yourself, or hyping yourself up to do thing you want to do, but it never happens, so it makes you feel like a failure and a lazy bones, and it just makes it worse, cycling between the feeling of hopelessness and failure to, "Come on, damnit!! Let me just do this *ONE* THING, Please!!"  Idk how long I've been in this cycle, but it sucks. I still haven't started on anything I wanted to do yet.  EDIT: This is really heartwarming to see that we can all support each other at our lowest. Thanks everybody!

Even though it runs in my family and I’ve exhibited all the symptoms, I wasn’t able to get diagnosed until recently. After a month of confirmed ADHD and no medication other than my anxiety meds, my girlfriend talked to me about telling my psychiatrist about ADHD and asking for meds. She prescribed me with a small dose of Adderall, which I took this morning for the first time. And for the first time in my entire life, my mind was quiet. No longer did I have to have 3 songs, a tv show and a Shakespearean sonnet all over each other going on in my head. I was able to finish my homework that would have normally taken me 5-6 hours in three while not being constantly distracted by my parents watching tv in the other room, or the AC buzzing. Easy to say, I cried. Thank you for supplying a place to let me share this news.
dcd0fbdf82c02613ce76ec3bf4f126c035ac8bd7346c800125ef049ee900195d;;;Received official diagnosis today. Thank you to each and every one of you.;;;I finally received an official diagnosis at close to 40. I almost wanted to cry out of relief that it is now official and not just in my head. The impostor syndrome is strong with this one.  Thank you to every one of you who shared your experiences and gave encouragement, advice, and overall support in this sub-reddit. There were symptoms I wasn't even aware could fall under ADHD.  Because of all of you, I was able to consult my psychiatrist with informed questions and descriptions.  You guys have helped navigate this journey more than you can imagine.  The flair fits what today is for me: a celebration of finally getting the correct diagnosis and tools to manage it.  Thank you.  To the redditor who introduced me to this subreddit, encouraged me to get a diagnosis and graciously allowed me to PM her questions, I only wish I could thank you directly, but unfortunately Reddit ate my whole inbox and I lost your username.  From the bottom of my heart, thank you.
b4c7b95b6ac83ef2f1aa58317dd747f17b8088a5368cedd8a49ad1dd039b253e;;;ADHD: Studying tips from a student that went from having almost all F's, to having gotten almost straight A's for the last two years.;;;I wrote this as response to someone else asking for studying tips for people with ADD/ADHD, and thought I ought to post the answer here as well.  Since I'm dyslectic and English being my second language, I do apologize for the inevitable grammar/spelling mistakes. But without further ado:  Since I have both ADD + dyslexia some things listed might not apply to you.  * Precursor: Medication: This has made it possible for me to have the energy to keep up with the work. And not completely crash in to a comatose after a couple of days work.  I know some people are vary of this, and to each their own. But I've gone from a student with F in almost all subjects (with the exception of Math and English), to an almost straight A student. And I couldn't have done it without medication, contrary to some belief.  *What most people seem to forget is that all ADD/ADHD is not equal.*  There's a big difference between the severity for each individual, thus saying one ought or ought not use medication is a useless debate if you're not the persons psychiatrist.  (*This also applies to possible side effects)*.  * First, For the distraction: One thing I've learned early on is to accept that since I'm both impulsive and easily distracted by the environment. I wont get any studying done in an environment which promotes the two. Thus when I study, I don't do it at home for the most part. But I'll leave the house and go to the library and or the school and try to find as remote a room as possible.  *  Secondly: I use the app (Forest) which locks my phone from opening other apps for the duration of my choosing (I usually set it to 25 minutes). Thus when I start a pomodoro-pass the only thing I'll do is to study.  **However and this is important!** When I feel like I can't continue (Notice that I didn't say if! :D), and that too I'm tired. I simply just sit still, stare at the wall or close my eyes for a minute or two, but I won't stop the timer.  Because most often after 2-3 minutes of this, I'll get bored and continue studying. And it helps feeling a bit guilty for not studying while the tree is still growing! hehe :)  *  Third: I have snacks with me for small boosts of energy. As Dr. Russell A. Barkley pointed out in the lecture (ADHD: Essential Ideas for Parents), our brains are one of two organs which use sugar as an energy source.  ***However this does not mean you ought to eat plenty***.  For example I take Dextrose-Energy tablets once and hour or after each Pomodoro, and throughout the day I'll eat fruits etc.  *  Fourth, and this is for reading: When I read things, the text gets all jumbled up and so the meaning gets lost in translation. But instead of reading a passage over and over again.  I noticed that when I wrote down everything on paper while reading it. The text became more coherent and I could easily find when I started to jumble up the text. Since what I was writing didn't make any sense!!!  Yes this takes (3x) as long.  However so does re-reading a text over and over + I don't get as easily bored.  * Fifth: Let's say you have a lecture in biology, philosophy or what have you. And it's about an hour long on YouTube or something akin to it.  What I've found to be a good hack, is open like 5 different lectures on the same topic.  So when I get that deep feeling of unease that I can't continue.  Instead of stopping completely, I'll open up another lecture. And eventually I'll have watched 5 instead of none!  * Sixth: Break down the task: Since procrastination is also largely due to emotion regulation. Whenever I'm presented with a large assignment I get the so called "Ostrich effect" of wanting to bury my head in the sand and pretend that it isn't there.  Therefore when I get a big assignment, I will just read the questions and take a day or two (if I have the time) to ponder the questions. And try to think how I might be able to break down the tasks into smaller steps. I.e Today or this Pomodoro pass I will write a sentence or two.   * Lastly: Remember to treat yourself as a reward when finishing a task. The reward can be whatever you choose. But it's good to then have bigger reward for instance at the end of a semester.   For example: If I can complete this year without failing a subject I will buy myself a (X).  However "If don't succeed", I will forgive myself and be happy that I did my best!  So let's buy a (Y) instead, or simply go on a nature hike or whatever floats your boat.    TLDR: ***Cough***  1. Choose a discreet location for your studies.  2. Study using the Pomodoro technique with the Forest app: (https://www.forestapp.cc/),  or something akin to it.  3.) Snacks and food for continues energy when working/studying.  4.) ***For Dyslexia***: Write what you read, this has been more easy (at least for me) to remember and comprehend the text.  And then as a bonus I use that book as an extended working memory and keep it with me! So whenever I/You get that feeling of yeah, I recall (x) person saying something like that. Wait, Tadaa!! Now you simply can just open up book and look up their name!  5.) Open a bunch of different tabs with similar subjects/or lectures:  So that instead of stopping what you're doing, when you get that deep sense of unease that you can't continue. Instead of jumping between unrelated subjects. They will relate to the task at hand and eventually you will have completed them all!! Yay us :D  6.) Breakdown: No not mentally, since we've have plenty of those already. But break down the tasks in baby steps, make a game out of figuring out how one might go about breaking down the task. Instead of saying I need to write 10 pages by (x day). Instead, we can say "Today I just need write a sentence or two".   7) Last but not least! Treat yo self fool! Whether that is diddling with your privates or someone else's. Eating something delicious, or buying the master-blaster mega disaster water cannon that you've always wanted.  Or perhaps, if you're as annoying as me and find joys in trying to teach others what you've learned go for it! (P.s nature hikes is an excellent tactic to make it harder for your friends and family to escape your shenanigans!)   Hope that helps! But I will be honest with you. Yes this takes longer than for most people.  And so I won't have as much free time as others, so I would be lying if I said it wasn't hard from time to time.  That's why it is important to remember that when It might be to much, is to take a longer well earned break! So that we can feel more like a human every now and then! (If possible, hehe :)  Last but not least! Even though it's hard working towards my goal of helping others (I'm trying to become a neuroscientist).  The pain now is nothing in comparison to doing nothing at all. (Or at least that's what it felt like).  P.S: I would love it if any of you wrote back to me if any of my tips helped.  But also if you want me to elaborate more on a point.   ///Kind Regards, Ankianka.

Edit: oh my gosh thank you for all the amazing and kind replies and overwhelming positivity. I can’t possibly reply to you all but had a little happy cry in the bath.  Some points that have been asked a lot:  My med regime: The meds that work for me might not work for you, it’s best to talk it out with your psych and experiment. It’s taken me almost 9 months to work out the big kinks and I still have better days and worse days on them.   The secret: the meds and diagnosis were the final piece of the puzzle.   Other v important bits in no particular order:   - Getting my depression treated - Going to a fuck tonne of therapy (different kinds) - Asking for help - Building a support network - Asking my GP for help but advocating for myself (went armed with an annotated DSM-IV) - Luck - Forcing myself to sleep - Forcing myself to exercise - Forcing myself to eat vegetables - Working constantly and desperately on routines (it’s never work but I was trying to study, trying to be on time etc, I’d literally sit at a desk for 8 hours everyday for weeks before a deadline/exam but manage to do nothing until the day before) - Figuring out what works for me e.g. I don’t go to lectures nor do I review them. I do, however, get involved in lots of practical stuff and moulage days etc because that’s how I learn best.  In short: therapy + support network + never giving up (kind of) then getting diagnosed + meds = achieving *consistency* which is they key 🔑   Love this community and it’s overwhelming positivity and support ❤️   Edit: formatted and stuff 😬
dd265f7ab0d08d7c4433181192b65dfee837ade7292bb0c9b1094a0b296b6a3c;;;Having ADHD is like permanently living as an intellectual tourist.;;;We bounce from interest to interest, travel through a fantastic landscape of ideas, stop to explore the coolest attractions, get friendly with the local experts, and then we leave forever.  Later, we occasionally flirt with the idea of going back. Most of the times, we don't.  And sometimes, we're not intellectual tourists as much as intellectual vagrants, because we never made any interest our home.
ec87d13fdb4725585b7999bde468a7a4701c8a64215627afb7aed23c9f998628;;;Dear family and friends of adhd-ers. Your loved one will not "get better";;;I have ADHD. My dad has ADHD.   I know that it's hard for NT folks to understand what it's like to have ADHD, but you HAVE to stop connecting moral judgement to our ability or inability to do things.   We would not be on time if we just loved you more. We would not remember our appointments of we just tried harder.   Our brains are not a good fit for this neurotypical world.   Assistive methods and devices are not there to train us to have a habit when they're gone. Assistive methods are what allow us to maintain these habits.   If we grow out of one method it's just because we've replaced it with another. Ideally the method would be housed in our brain (yay medicine! or meditation! or positive self talk! or any sorts of other internal practices!) but it's still there.   You are allowed to be frustrated with us. You are allowed to be angry when we don't follow through on commitments or pull our weight or mess up.   You're not allowed to extrapolate intention from this. Maybe your assistance helps us do things. This doesn't mean we're some deadbeat who wants to be babied or cared for. It just means that this assistance you provide works.   And if that's the method we're using, you can't be upset when you're gone for a few days and we fail at a task. Because our method was you, and you were not there. Your assistance is not teaching us to be better. Nothing about this is a teaching moment, other than teaching us to feel even more shame.   It's also okay for you to not want to be our method. It's okay for you to stop providing that assistance and have us find something different that works. But you also have to understand that we do have to find a replacement. It will take time. We will mess up.   This doesn't mean we're trying to guilt you into returning to helping us in the same way. It just means that we genuinely relied on you for this.   If a person is permanently leaning backwards and you're holding them up, it's okay to say that you're not comfortable holding them any longer. You're tired and feeling used.   It's okay to tell them to go find something else to hold them up.   But this person can't stand level on their feet. They'll always be leaning.   That doesn't mean your obligation is any greater.   It just means that when they wobble and fall without you there, you can't accuse them of just doing it to guilt you. They can't help it. They're just trying to find things to hold them up. That alarm clock isn't strong enough, the calendar lets them sink to the ground, the chore wheel is too small.   ADHD folks. We have to be okay with falling. We can't turn this into actual guilt trips.   Just like our body and mind is ours, theirs is theirs.   Sometimes methods work but they don't work out.   Sometimes you have to let go. We will fall.   Sometimes the falling has a lot of consequences.   Sometimes you've been yelling at us for laying on the ground for our whole life and we just can't find anything to prop us up.   But our balance issue is incurable. Without external forces we will never stand up straight. Maybe for a second we might be able to fake it so it looks that way, but that's not true.   We can't be cured.   Our brains will always be doing that and we're just doing our best.     Sorry if this was long, feel free to disagree, I just feel a lot about this today. I just feel this so much. The shame. The judgement. Please give your loved one the benefit of the doubt. People with ADHD can be jerks too, but the struggles of being ADHD are not what defines them as such.
095e88bfe86ab3d0cc753d6f347f248fffdd994133ec18a2da1f16f587bad3a5;;;Small mental trick to skip "starting" things and magically just be doing them already;;;This is a way I can trick myself into doing that thing i need to do.  Before you try this, note how the boundary line between different activities is not really a line at all. Normally when we have decided we are "doing" some new task, actually we are still in the process of moving towards the actual action, or are focused on it mentally.   So, when you can't get your ass off the couch to do the chore, just stop whatever you may be doing and close your eyes for a moment. Feel your surroundings for a moment, in a sort of mindful way. Notice that because starting a task is basically an abstraction, and won't change anything in the external environment at first, having begun the task will actually feel just as relaxing and easy as what you are doing now, except your immediate goals will have changed somewhat.   Now, since "actually being started" on the thing is just a convenient abstraction, tell yourself that you actually are already in the process of doing this task. Rather than going through some mental event of "getting started", simply recategorize the current moment from "before beginning" to "after beginning".  If we think of the aversion to getting started on something as a sort of mental barrier, then for me this trick doesn't spend energy breaking through the wall like kool aid man. That takes a lot of mental energy. Rather, it's more like closing your eyes on one side of the intact wall, and opening them to find you are on the other side of the wall.   **EDIT TLDR**  What seems to be the main part about this that helps me is realizing that in the the moments instantaneously before you "begin" and instantaneously  after you "begin", your body and your surroundings feel basically the same. This is not really a complete summary of what's above, but one of the more important parts.
db32737e0faa812addfa3cbcf0069d123988dcaa6cce2f819c8764c40b8ee9c7;;;A word on meds from an ADHD doc;;;I'm a physician with ADHD and I treat ADHD in children.  My own diagnosis at age 8 and my subsequent discovery of my own ability to succeed at school led to me choosing to follow this career path and give back to the medical community that helped me so much.    I often see posts in this subreddit in which people ask how a medicine is "supposed" to make them feel or solicit experiences from other posters.  While I think it's fine for people to discuss their own experiences, I want to emphasize: *you cannot generalize one person's experience with an ADHD med to all people*.    I can have two patients the same age, ethnicity, size, sex, and one does great on CONCERTA and the other does horribly.  That goes for just about every med.  Personally, I take CONCERTA and it works great for me, while I found ADDERALL and DEXEDRINE to be suboptimal with watered-down effects.  But I have plenty of patients who would very adamantly tell the opposite story.    What matters is that your doctor takes a uniform approach to stimulant medication for all patients and that your doctor initially follows up with you frequently, takes your concerns and opinions about your response and side-effects seriously, and understands the mechanisms of action and pharmacokinetics at work.  That last bit is important.  When I manage an ADHD med, I have plasma concentration graphs in my head while I visualize mathematically what I want for a patient.  It really does take that kind of understanding, in my opinion, to provide the best management for patients.  So when someone else tells you that this or that medication was wonderful or terrible, take that story with a huge grain of salt.  Your own response might be very different and the only way to know is to try.

My mom very nicely asked if we would watch Its A Wonderful Life for christmas eve. My little brothers meds just wore off before the movie started so he was all squirmy and couldnt pay attention. My stepdad yelled at him "COULD YOU STOP" cus he and my other brother joked and were discussing the movie, so I responded "I thought it was funny". I understand its important to be quiet during movies, but its christmas eve, were supposed to have fun as a family. So I texted her and told her that theyre making this movie much less fun, and cus its christmas eve we would like to have fun as a family, meaning we interact and laugh. Were not in a movie theatre. But also I told her to not get mad at him for expecting something he can't do right now, and that theres other ways to approach this.  edit: my mom yelled at him too

Step 3: Hold yourself to the conventional standards of society.  Step 4: Believe everyone's ridiculous moralising when they say you are not living up to your potential, you are lazy, you just need to try harder, focus and apply yourself.  Step 5: Keep trying, as hard as you can, and still not reaching the unattainable standards set by society, and in turn, yourself.  Step 6: Never tell anyone about the issues with motivation, memory or organisation. They are moral failings, not cognitive disorders. Only disclose anxiety and depression, because everyone knows they are real problems.  Step 7: Don't find out about ADHD. Knowledge is power, and you can't work on a project if you don't know how the subject matter operates.    It's been a long road, but thank fuck I've stopped making everything a moral issue. I'm very logical really, so I don't know where I got that from, other than society constantly drumming it into me for 30 odd years...

When I’m confident I won’t shut up (I ask a lot of questions too and get bored easily unless someone's fun/funny). People find me funny. But when I’m anxious I’m so scared of what people think of me I shut down completely. Say dumb things. Brain freezes. I’m the quiet girl from pitch perfect. People exposure has to be constant to cure my SA- but maintaining interest in hobbies, routine, commitment.. getting myself to start a job application/turn up on time..it’s so freakin hard. Ironically i despise being alone. Love talking to people when im not anxious but it takes A LOT to get me there.  tldr- either the loudest or quietest person in the room. Constant exposure cures SA but difficult with lack of discipline/low threshold for boredom. Advice appreciated.  update: I'm shook from the reaction I've gotten. I've questioned my adhd diagnosis a lot- if i'm just making an excuse for my laziness. But this makes me feel more at peace now.

I've gone my entire life thinking that I'm not as smart as my friends. Thinking that I'm not good enough for the job that I have. Struggling through high school and college. How much easier would the last **23 years** have been if I had been able to take medication?  &#x200B;  My mom never once told me that I was diagnosed. I have never taken medication and I don't remember ever seeing any doctors when I was a child. Her reason for not pursuing any kind of corrective measures? Apparently the doctor that diagnosed me told her that ADHD is a sign of an intelligent brain. So she latched onto that and didn't think there was even a problem to address.  &#x200B;  Not gonna lie, I'm livid right now.

I don't think she's researched that or done it because of ADHD, she's done it because she just knows and gets me and doesn't see anything I need as a disorder or a problem.  I am smug as all hell because I have such an awesome friend, but I'm also sharing because this is actually a great workaround. I now feel able to read the long message because I know I only need to actually think about her 4 bullet points when I reply. I thought that could be useful to others.

I want to scream. I feel like i’m so broken i can’t be fixed. I started Adderall a few days ago and it’s not making any difference. I’m scared that i’m a lost cause. I’m scared that i can’t be fixed. I’ve been living with this for so long without any treatment and i realized only a few months ago how much it contributes to my depression. I just hate it so much and I feel like no one realizes how hard it is.   Edit:  Hi i really didn’t expect so many responses to this. I probably won’t be able to answer them all but thank you so much to everyone for the support and advice. This is a really great community, i posted this on a whim and i’m glad I did.  Also just to clarify some things/add context: I’m in an inpatient unit currently, have been for about two weeks. Yes i’m allowed to have my phone, this particular unit is pretty lenient about it, we just can’t take pictures. I’ve started a few meds while here - Wellbutrin (for depression and adhd), gabapentin (for GAD), naltrexone (this one’s kind of an experiment... doctors said it may help with my dermatillomania), and the Adderall. In addition to all that I’ve been doing ECT. So there’s a lot that i’m monitoring right now. So far the only big difference i’ve noticed is my mood is generally better and suicidal thoughts are much less prevalent. I think the ECT is helping with that. But anxiety and adhd are still fucking me over just as much as usual.

I am actually a college professor, and I also have been through college (twice) and grad school with untreated ADHD, and I thought I would offer my best advice for students.  I don't want to suggest all of these will work for everyone, and of course I encourage other suggestions in the comments!  (Note: I'm in the US. Some of this may differ for your country.)  1. If your university has a Disability Services office (or equivalent) make sure to talk to them.  In the US, we are required by law to allow students certain accommodations for ADHD, but as a professor I am required to get a letter from DS before I can offer them.  These can be things like extra time on exams or papers, or the ability to take exams in a room free of distractions, or attendance flexibility.  2. If you feel like you are struggling in a class, TALK TO THE PROF AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  I cannot stress this enough.  If you come to me a week before finals and ask me what you can do to bring your grade up, there is nothing I can do.  I can't teach you a quarter's worth of material in an hour.  But if you come to me right away, I can explain a concept to you so that when we move on you can follow.  3. Don't assume study habits that worked in high school will work in college.  College is a very different beast and it takes a LOT more work and commitment.  This is not to say you can't do it!  I recommend blocking out 20-30 minutes of study time intermittently, then do something completely different for half an hour.  Set timers.  After the break, do another 20-30 minutes.  If you try to study for three hours straight you won't remember anything.  4. When you have a big project, FORCE yourself to work on it for at least 30 minutes per day.  You will thank yourself later.  If you aren't sure how to start or aren't sure you can make yourself do it, talk to the prof or tutoring services (see below).  Also, don't underestimate peer pressure! Recruit friends, classmates, or roommates to nag you about working on your stuff.  5. Take advantage of tutoring and/or counseling services offered by the school.  They are paid to help you!  Seriously,  you will never again have access to the amount of free help that you will have in college; use it!  6. If you are doing badly in a class (or it's so uninteresting that you can't pay attention), you usually have the option to drop!  Having a "W" on the transcript is better than an "F".  But even if you fail a course, it's not the end of the world.  You can nearly always repeat a class if necessary. Don't allow one bad class to mess your plans up.  In addition, if you get to the end of a course and have done okay but just can't manage to pull off the final project, try talking to the professor about an Incomplete grade. You may need documentation (or you may not) but it can sometimes allow you a little extra time to finish.  Note: not all profs/schools/circumstances will allow this so don't rely on it. But it can be an option.   You can do this!  Edit: wow, I'm so glad this was helpful to so many of you!  Thanks to whoever gave awards--literally the first I've ever gotten.

Speak your mind. A title is required, **but expanding further in the text field is not.** Beginning your title with "vote up if" is violation of intergalactic law.  Then below after I press submit (without any text in the body), it says:  >Post body must contain text. Post body must contain text.   Pick one.    I'm using my 'body space' to question another horribly formed subreddit rule.  Cheers r/ADHD  **Actually, fuck it, here's some body:**  There's a girl at work who I met on my first day who just instantly gravitated towards me for some reason and since then we've spent a lot of time together.  She's really shy but is an open book once I get her talking.  We share A LOT of similarities, always have the best time together and the best conversations, and I couldn't for the life of me figure out how this girl could be everything I could ever ask for and knock me on my ass so easily.  Then she told me she has ADHD and I was like "ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh", and then it clicked.  "That's why you're such a breath of fresh air - because you get it.  You get me.  You don't know I have ADHD but you're somehow pressing all the right buttons, and now I know why I'm so comfortable and happy and feel so at home when I'm around you".  **EDIT** If I've learned one thing from this thread, it's that we all need to hang out sometime.
0eaeb3801f5dcbb86fae873f152319c738e6a25ff475d8dc71a97d28cbd4da0d;;;Thank you to the person who posted about wanting to tell their boss about their ADHD.;;;Well, title.   Someone posted about wanting to tell their boss about their ADHD and I’d commented about how not doing that at my last job was one of my biggest regrets in life. I didn’t tell them I was struggling with working from home, I just quit. I wasn’t officially diagnosed or medicated and with the severity of my ADHD it was almost impossible for me to get anything done and I’d have panic attacks almost every day.   But now, I have my shit together and my meds have basically saved my life- and that post saved my ass. I’m a nanny and I really don’t like it, but seeing that post made me reach out to my old boss and ask for my job back.   I have a “re-interview” Friday and I know I’m getting it back. Fuck yeah. Thank you.  Edit: ty for the award friend :)  Edit edit: Reaching out to your boss/supervisor about your ADHD is never an easy thing. Use common sense here if you plan to. If you don’t know them well but you feel like it’s an important conversation to have, an email with a short explanation and an attachment of a note from your doc/psychiatrist should be fine.  Edit edit edit: Most companies/businesses in most states require accommodation for ADD/ADHD under ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act). You can’t be fired specifically for your disability once you’ve disclosed your official diagnosis with them, however, you can still be fired for still not doing your job after receiving reasonable accommodations once you’ve disclosed this.
a5366b8365ad5c7cbd8b71ae246e96efa3bd6b7bf8f0d18e27c98d27b0bbdf78;;;Why “you just need to be more attentive” is the wrong thing to say to a loved one with ADHD.;;;I’m attentive. I’m attentive all the damn time.  Having ADHD, you become extremely aware of how often you fuck up. It makes you extremely conscious of avoiding upsetting people. I spend my life feeling like I’m treading on eggshells because of it.  The problem lies here: That list of appropriate actions you consider as common sense? Looks completely different to the list my brain comes up with.  I forget to put away the dishes because I noticed we were out of toilet paper and realised we should buy more. I accidentally broke your glass in the sink because I wanted to clear the kitchen space for you since I know you had a long day and would appreciate a clean space. I forgot our brunch plans because I was too busy shopping for your birthday.  Having ADHD isn’t a lack of care. I care ALL THE FUCKING TIME it’s just that the list of priorities that my brain comes up with are in a different order, and my capacity to run several of those things at once is also a little smaller.  Nothing makes me more upset and depressed than seeing my loved ones upset with me and thinking I don’t care about them. I’m constantly dedicating my mental energy to the people around me - my brain just doesn’t shoot in a way that hits the targets you were expecting them to.  When I ask my loved ones to be really specific about the things they expect of me, I don’t think they truly understand that it’s not me being lazy, it’s me trying my hardest to bring our lists as close together as possible.   I am totally capable of doing those things you want of me - I just need some time to set them in my list as a permanent habit as it doesn’t just occur to me internally.
f8bb8865a4312a45708aa7bac20a2fb42045452472368ccd681e22f4087a510f;;;Dear Former Gifted Kids,;;;It's not your fault that you struggled when you gained autonomy.  It's not your fault that it's difficult, if not impossible to clean or maintain personal hygiene.  &#x200B;  You don't have to be perfect or prove yourself to anyone, even though it may feel that way.  You don't have to make A's in every class anymore. It doesn't mean you're not smart, it means you're learning and growing.  &#x200B;  It's okay that anxiety precedes every phone call, and it's okay that you missed an appointment.  It's okay that you struggle to make friends or maintain relationships.  &#x200B;  To be blunt, ***it's okay if you fuck up.***  &#x200B;  Everybody fucks up sometimes, not just those of us with ADHD or co-morbid disorders. I personally needed to hear some of this stuff at one point in my life, so I’m passing the torch, so to speak.  I hope you don't see this as an empty, sweet nothing, but your best is enough. It really is. It's okay to fail, and it's okay if you're not the best at something. Being the best is boring cause there's no learning or challenge left anyway :)  &#x200B;  Edit: It's my understanding that many of us were labeled as gifted children growing up, and I hope this doesn't feel exclusive to anyone that wasn't. I think that ADHD sucks for most who struggle with it, that it's not a "super power," but that we are ALL intelligent and creative in unique ways. This is just in response to those memes about how we all grew up and got super depressed, or weren't diagnosed because "we got good grades." I also don't mean to insinuate that you're not smart anymore, the title is really just in reference to the memes :)  Update: The response to this has been unexpected and humbling. You are all so wonderful, and I love reading about your own experiences. I grew up very anxious and lonely, and I'm emotional at the thought of how many of you shared that pain. Thank you all for being so open and kind <3

Not your medications.;;;I've been struggling to remember this lately.    Vyvanse doesnt magically make me smarter or suddenly gain new skills. It just allows me to harness and gain more control over the knowledge and skills I already have so I can peform at my top more consistantly.   Edit: Thanks for the gold!  It means a lot that this post has been helpful to so many of you. This is my favourite sub, we have such a loving supportive community here!
1af4bcd68c13cd2c3f96093d399e7d75b8d840c586b4eeada4c90435d7755dd9;;;YOU GUYS, I DID A HUGE THING;;;for the first time this year my bedroom is COMPLETELY CLEANED AND ORGANIZED! i am about to sit on my VACUUMED floor and cry tears of relief. i wish i could share a picture, im so proud of myself...
a64331e714ca09bf99c0b40e8a46bee8240b3b649d70b92fed3f590e231f0d2e;;;Lost it all. Take this stuff serious.;;;Hello there this is my story (small paragraphs because u know)  1. I knew i had troubles from a while back. I’m a brilliant mind who got far in life, i’ve always had issues in executing, i was kinda oblivious to the why.   2. Symptoms got worse with total isolation, MJ, nicotine, coffee, semi bad diet, lack of exercise also moved out of the country.   3. im running a company which is the only thing i have left and is running because i hired the right people, not even because of me.  4. Lost someone that i called the love of my life. This has kept me in bed since it happened, specially due the shady circumstances of this event.   5. I lost contact with everyone i love while im dealing with this.  6.  I haven’t been able to consistently put 1h of work in the last 2 weeks.   7. A side from this.. i got no support system, almost no friends, i moved to Canada alone to study and planning to stay.   BUT ———  — i stand up from bed, biked 20km to a doctor appointment that took me almost a month to make. today i got referred to a psychotherapist.   Guys, im 26.  This stuff will eat your life away if you let it.   1. It will make you cope with other issues in different ways  2. It will firetruck your relationships   3. It will flunk your confidence  4.  It will eat your mind silently   Don’t wait anymore and if you’re reading this... do that appointment. Let them screen you.   Go to therapy.   Your brain is not chemically normal, dont expect it to work like it.  I always exceed in thinking and never in execution and i’ve had enough of my own bs.  At this point i believe medication is the only option.  Wellbeing is not enough.   The feeling of being alone and dealing with this is the hardest part. But at least we dealing.  This have been a really difficult times.  Stay safe.   I will update when i get prescriptions and results of the tests.  —— UPDATE # 1  The response in this community has been overwhelming.  I never thought to read so many similar cases which make me think that we should be putting our global efforts into finding better and more permanent solutions.  I cant imagine the amount of people that go by without knowing they have this. Specially on low income households and third worlds countries, where mental health is still a taboo.  After learning about adhd i started seeing the same paterns on some of my close friends, my dad & even one of my roomates.   I read all of your comments with teary eyes, i will be answering them all one by one.  As for those who are not motivated to get help due to financial, a part of the people on the comments have gotten a 100% virtual screening and medication and it got better.  As an investment , being able to work and function properly will give you more money on the long term than whatever is that cost the treatment.   As for me, i never thought this was gonna “blow up” i was just venting a bit.   To everyone who contacted me directly trough the chat, also thank you for taking your time and energy to just send me good vibes.  Amazing community, i trully feel the support.   Thank you infinite times.  ——————  Update #2  ——————  1. Just today, after so much hassle between doctors and pharmacies, finally got my prescription for -modafinil- it only took me since 9am until 5pm easy pz  2. I took one dosis for 100mg to try it out.  3. Currently waiting the half hour to see how it does, doctor told me that i might be needing 200mg if i dont feel anything with 100mg  4. Modafinil, as almost all stimulants will affect the heart rate, which i also will keep in check every two weeks.   5. The modafinil plasma peak will hit after 2-4h which is perfect since i got a long night ahead with a lot of work.  6. My insurance didn’t covered any of this so it was 80$ for 60 tablets (100mg each)   And thats pretty much second wave of updates.   As for my mental health i am feeling positive. Good mood. Sun shines out for me. I hope modafinil does the trick.   This is my attempt to recover back my life.  I will update next week to let you all know how the substance is affecting me.  My doctor had some choices but i personally wanted modafinil due to the really good experience i’ve heard from people also is non addictive and non amphetamine  vs adderall (which is my next choice if modafinil doesn’t work for me)  Again, thank you all, remember to not prolongate your mental health as it will take a silent tax that only you will notice when you don’t have anything left to pay with.   7 more days see you here, i will keep doing this for a while.
7070e2a43ade7f96b94793a781ff1b06f7f549162c0c549e13d67665db93275c;;;the “everyone feels like that” response to adhd symptoms feels invalidating;;;i’m particularly tired this week. i don’t know why i feel like this happens very often about ADHD problems (more than other MH issues) but the amount of times i’ve tried to explain an adhd problem to a friend and have been met with the “everyone feels that way” comment is invalidating and frankly infuriating.  i don’t expect everyone to understand what goes on in my head especially because i can’t imagine what it could possibly be like in the head of another person who doesn’t have these issues but can’t people take a step back from coopting every mental illness symptom as “relatable content?” I know i’m not the only person with adhd or mental illness and i know it goes undiagnosed in a lot of people but it really seems like the general population doesn’t understand the difference between experiencing a feeling occasionally and experiencing it to the point that it becomes debilitating and interferes with quality of life.  when people keep reacting to the mental health specific feelings i express to them, it really makes me wonder if i’m delusional and no different from the average person, that my struggles are made up, etc. again i don’t know what it’s like to live in someone else’s brain, so all i know is my own so i have nothing to compare to.  &#x200B;  >**edit-** it looks like a lot of people think my ADHD complaint to my friends was about being tired which is funny because i didn’t intend for it to read that way. I *am* tired in general yes, but when i said that originally, i meant i’m tired of the dismissive responses i’ve been receiving. the original adhd complaint i received the “everyone feels that way” response to was that i was trying to describe that feeling when your brain gets really overwhelmed with info that it just kind of stalls and you get stuck and can’t move forward with tasks.  &#x200B;

dc937b59892604f5a86ac96936cd7ff09e25f18ae6b758e8014a24c7fa039e91;;;A useful technique I learned in my weird acting class that helps me stop racing thoughts with ADHD;;;Hi everyone,  I signed up for a local acting class (I’m not an actor, I just like to try things) at the repertory theater and didn’t realize it was actually a method acting class, which was strange to encounter as an outsider but I’m lucky it was! The acting coach followed the [Stanislavski method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislavski%27s_system).  Our homework on the first day was to bring a task from home that we needed to do and do it in front of the class as if nobody was watching. The next week we had to do a task we had never done before while the class watched, and the week after we had to do a task we had done before as if we had never done it before. For the first, I painted my toes. For the next, I tried building a bird house. And the last, I braided my hair.   What I learned is that a way I can focus on only what I’m doing and forget the audience is to constantly follow "steps" in each task I’ve made for myself. After braiding my hair, I realized how interesting this was for someone with severe adult ADHD. What I learned is that *if I approach a task as if I’ve never done it before and follow each step like it is new, I forget about everything else.*   Lately, I’ve found my thoughts racing to the point I can’t really keep up with myself. The way I can get it to slow down is if I concentrate on the steps to a task as if it’s new. It’s kind of like what they call "monkey mind" in Zen Buddhism. If you give the monkey something to pick apart, it allows you to directly experience life without the dissatisfying interruption of anxious thoughts.  Hope this helps!
11f3f56019a7968ff686a0ab4607f53f6d07f1abded940a0c21e855bf543d12b;;;The Plate is Too Small: Anecdote from an ADHD couple;;;My wife and I both have ADHD. It can pose some challenges. Everytime one of us feels frustrated and unmotivated, as is often the case with this disorder, we communicate this by telling the other that "The plate is too small". How this came to be is kind of a fun story.  I was once preparing dinner for my wife, some vegetables and meat. We only have two plates in our appartment : one big plate for my wife to eat in, and one small plate for storing leftovers in the fridge.  Before you ask, yes, we only have two plates to avoid accumulating dirty dishes. It works pretty well. Personaly, I prefer a bowl.  Anyway, the normal plate was dirty while I was serving her dinner. And I was already frustrated and unmotivated that day, so instead of gathering the motivation to just wash it, I went and tried to serve the meal in the small plate.  First I put vegetables, but then there is no place for the meat. Instead of accepting the problem and dealing with it in an adult way, I spend A FULL MINUTE trying to find a way to fit the meat on top of the vegetables on this very small plate, and obviously failing.  Finally, my wife in the living room hear me yell in frustration and anger, and ask me what's wrong. I yell back, with my saddest voice : "The plate is too small !"  She immediatly burst into laughter at the ridicule of the situation. Suddenly realizing how stupid I must sound right now, I can't help but start laughing too.  Ever since this happened, anytime one of us was too annoyed or frustrated to deal with the current situation, we'd always talk about how small the plate is.
59ebc9abd8c8c8d2ee570cc51be855c2aa57587e956c88bf628da623aef0f91e;;;How to stop invalidating the fact that you have ADHD just because you were an academically great child & symptoms only started deeply affecting you in your adulthood?;;;I feel like this is pretty common with women, but I always find myself invalidating an ADHD diagnosis just because of my grades as a child (I was in TAG) and the fact that the effects of ADHD did not start really affecting me until I hit my first year of college and realized my “habits” (the effects) were not normal or sustainable at all. I have a lot of guilt around my peers who also have ADHD and have different, more impactful effects, and sometimes feel like I faked my symptoms accidentally, even though my logical side is screaming at me that it’s not possible. I also have tics that started presenting a couple years ago (who knew that was an underdiscussed symptom??????) so I find myself thinking “maybe Im just neurologically messed up and its not ADHD” even though a neurologist signed off that Im healthy besides those. It’s hard because my parents definitely don’t believe in it and I also find myself invalidating my ADHD out of pressure from them. Does anyone else deal with this? I feel like getting a diagnosis as an adult just comes with a weird mental toll, at least for me, even though it also provides a lot of relief.
885382deb2218f64a93f6d0f74f0160b225bdc16bcdca4c90f3fcc2b84cb120b;;;I was first diagnosed 44 years ago, way before it was called ADHD. Here are some things I have learned.;;;1.	 It’s not a competition with other folks so blessed to see who “has it worse”, the only one we are competing with is ourselves. 2.	 There are endless combinations of symptoms so just because someone doesn’t have your particular flavor of ADHD does not make them any less authentic.   (See #1) 3.	 The secret to success is mastery of coping skills, NOT mastery of ADHD.  That shit ain’t never going away, but it can be tamed.   4.	 Keep a Coping Skills Journal on your phone where you lIst  all of the skills you learn and reread it when you have downtime.   I have forgotten way more of these tricks than I remember and it’s because I didn’t keep track.   No, those scraps of paper are not going to help you remember all this stuff... they  just end up in piles. 5.	Speaking of piles, accept them.  I spent 25 years freaking out over those piles until my wife (she’s a genuine saint she is) taught me to accept who I am and work within the framework of that knowledge.   The piles will never go away, but you can learn Tricks To help make them manageable. 6.	learn to love reading.  Many of us tend to hyper-focus on things and it’s often video games. I put millions of hours into online games before I came to my senses.   Four years ago I wrote my first novel in the time I would have spent playing WoW.   That changed my understanding of time.  I switched from gaming to reading (and then writing) and I have learned so much.  Not I have a cool set of skills and not some avatar. 7.	Blow off steam.  Run, work out, hike, whatever but do something that makes you move.   It’s a big part of dealing with this. 8.	If you use meds them use them.   Take them on a schedule and set timers.   It’s really important that we treat this holistically and pharmacology is part of that.  If you don’t go the meds rout then establish a pattern and follow it every day. 9.	Holistic means treat the whole body.  Eat right, no, really.   I know how wonderful it is to sugar out but we need to maintain as much balance as we can.   Diet and exercise  are important parts of that balance.  That whole reading thing comes in handy here. 10.  know your role.  In every group of friends there is a place for the hyper one.  Stop fighting it and embrace it.  Just Be yourself.   That's key. 11.  You are not perfect and will never be perfect.  Sooner you accept that the better.   12.  Nobody else is perfect.  Everyone has their flaws.   As soon as you understand that you can shed all kinds of stress. 13.  There are assholes who will not like you.  Why?  Because some people are just assholes.   Stop trying to make people like you and just be you.  14.  If someone has been a certain way for as long as you have known them then don’t get mad when they act in character over something.  You are never going to change the  way people are and you will save everyone a whole lot of stress and drama by not trying.   15.  ADHD gives you powers that other people do not have and will not understand.  Learn what your particular ADHD gifts are and hone them.  I teach, I can hear things that i should not hear, i can feel when the mood of a room changes and react before the kids know whats up.  I am hypersensitive to touch, sound, temp, air flow, and movement.   Its so much fun to use that.   Just don't touch me, expect me to wear itchy clothes, or not keep headphones and earplugs handy.    This is already really long.   There are other lessons but I have reading to do.     Edit 1:  Thanks for the Gold!!!  Great way to end the day.     Edit 2: (April 8th, 2018) So, it’s been MONTHS and I have not posted part 2.  Had a nasty crash (thanks Bipolar) but I’m up and moving now. Look for part two in the next week or so.

(especially for us);;;So the funny thing with neurotypicals is that most of the time they *want to* do something, they automatically have an amount of *motivation* to do that. So they assume that when they don't feel motivated to do something, it means they dont want it, because for most cases, the two overlap. But with our ADHD brains it is a different story. **The overlap between the things we want to do and the things we have motivation to do ist way smaller.** So often times we get told by neurotypicals that we actually don't want something, because they see our lack of motivation and our struggle to do it. We get told that we are just lazy, but in reality we *reaaallly want it*, we just have 10 times less motivation. But when everybody tells us lack of motivation means not wanting something, because for them it applies, we **start to believe that and think that something is wrong with us**. Then we try even harder, up to the point where we are just exhausted and hating ourselves to death.   So we need to understand, that our brains *really* function differently than nerotypical brains. And by realizing the difference between wanting and feeling motivated everyday, we maybe hold on to things we know we want, where neurotypicals will have given up thinking they must not want it.   *So don't let yourself down by others saying this and that, you know what you really want, probably more than they know!*

"I procrastinate sometimes" etc etc.  Finally i said: "you also get headaches, but that doesn't mean that others don't get migraines.  Headaches are normal but migraines can be a debilitating medical issue.".  After years of these discussions, she finally got it.
652cb210e1a723b8539ea081a6d8b445979267197082c125fcc71fa35786294f;;;Netflix documentary "Take your pills" is platantly misrepresenting ADHD and meds and making it seem that everyone who takes Adderall is abusing it;;;Netflix has released a documentary that crossly misrepresents those of us who use Adderall and simply put, it fearmogers Adderall and makes it seem like everyone who uses it is a junkie  We decided to fight back and have been tweeting on twitter with #iTakeMyPillsBecause   to tell everyone how it really is and that we really need our meds to be able to play on the same level as everyone else  The documentary seems to have a agenda of discrediting Adderalls positive effect on peoples life, while taking the negative effects way out of proportions
7fa449b26431046bab7f2281d47730f38202d762897ef4ce0cd9ed37c47af587;;;I feel like we’re attributing too many symptoms and idiosyncrasies to ADHD;;;The title should actually have said “Confusing too many idiosyncrasies as being symptoms of ADHD”  Sure ADHD has an impact on all aspects of ones functioning, but lately I’ve seen too many posts (im guilty too) associating almost any behaviour and observation with the disorder.   “Anyone feel like ADHD causes you to prefer Breaking Bad over the Sopranos because blah blah blah?”,   “Do you guys also find that you actually love the smell of burning hair?”  Or more realistically “Is hating loud noises a symptom of ADHD” and of course the comments all anecdotally agree and then suddenly that becomes a symptom.   I just think we need to take a step back sometimes and understand that we still have underlying personalities, preferences, and idiosyncrasies beneath the ADHD that influence a lot of our thoughts and behaviours.  :)  Edit;  Great to see this inspired some discussion and recognition of this insidious issue.  I know it can be comforting to find mutual symptoms/idiosyncrasies/whatever we’re calling them, but whilst the intentions are good, it can also lead to a very slippery slope as many have identified...  Passively allowing them to become part of ones identity instead of focusing on finding strategies to overcome them.   Don’t be too critical on yourself but conversely don’t settle for less than your potential (and oftentimes we know when we are)
321eda70f24b8c1ddebe3e0b3516cf900d1a025371419babe5c0ffe8ed337fae;;;Telling someone "you have ADD, not ADHD" is the equivalent of saying "you have Asperger's, not autism";;;One is now a defunct, unrecognized sub-type of the other.  Maybe take a minute a learn something before condescending to someone about their own disorder.  You are correct!  I don't bounce off the walls or talk a mile a minute.  The people who exhibit those symptoms are not more or less severely affected than me, and if you'd taken five minutes to read about it in the two years since I was diagnosed you'd know that.  Edit:  For clarification, what pissed me off was being dismissed as "just" having ADD, not that they're behind on the current DSM.  Because I don't fit their picture of what ADHD looks like, I don't have it "as bad".

My summer semester closed out yesterday, and I found out that I got a 4.0 for the first time in my life.;;;Hey guys!! long time lurker first time poster. i was first diagnosed back in the spring of 2018, after failing most of my classes horribly in the fall. before starting medication i could never focus for more than 5 minutes, my grades were horrible, and i couldn’t hold down a job for more than a month (srs got fired 2 times). i put a lot of weight on my academic performance, and getting Ds and Fs even though i was trying my hardest made me very anxious and depressed. i felt like a failure.  fast forward to now. i’ve started taking medication. i’m working 2 jobs, and taking classes full-time at my university. i decided to take 5 classes in a 6-week period.  it’s been extremely stressful, but today i found out i got a 4.0 GPA!!!! i never in a million years could’ve imagined getting straight As, even when i wasn’t working and school was my only responsibility. if i can do it, you can too!  UPDATE: wow i’m really surprised by the amount of attention this got. thank you for the kind words :)

This means banned from doing any other activities; watching movies, seeing friends, going to the protest today, even shopping, cleaning my room, sorting out bills and life admin.  I keep saying to myself; you are not allowed anything until you've made serious headway with your work. It is two days work, after that is over you can do everything else.  This has been going on a month and i'm at my wits end (plus had no social life and living in a pigsty). The one thing i keep up with is exercise but i'd rather be doing it mid afternoon and end up running 11pm at night (not ideal) because i keep saying i've got to work before i do it.   Any recommendations of what to do? I am seriously destroyed at this point. I just need to do this work. All i am doing is spending all day in bed hating myself pretty much day after day.

For my last exam I had to learn latin. I tried the university-courses, but they were too fast for me. So I studied latin on my own, for about 1 year, with a lot of breaks and crying inbetween.  And now I can get my bachelor, after 6 years instead of 3.  We might need more time, but we can make it. =)
43f1c1d78311d6284d1e4ea6b24fc8130964614ac8fcbdca2dd9d3f22694eb72;;;My boyfriend’s response to my ADHD made me cry.;;;When I first started dating my boyfriend over a year ago, I had just recently been diagnosed with ADHD. I had done a ton of research into it myself and I was always quick to correct people who would assume that I just can’t pay attention to things, including him. He caught on pretty quickly and started looking into ADHD on his own time.   One night when he came over he was giddy to show me something, and asked me for a piece of paper and a pen. He drew a lightbulb and a flashlight and explained: « Regular brains are like flashlights. They can easily put all their attention into just one thing. YOUR brain is more like a lightbulb: It’s just as bright, but your attention goes in many different directions at once. »   It’s not a perfect analogy but I was so touched that he’d obviously taken the time to look into ADHD and come up with an analogy for me. I was in tears and I still have that sheet of paper to this day.    Edit: Wow my first silver!! Thank you!!
dc937b59892604f5a86ac96936cd7ff09e25f18ae6b758e8014a24c7fa039e91;;;For those diagnosed with ADHD, do you find yourself ignoring notifications from friends (social media or texts)?;;;I have gone down the rabbithole of this subreddit and have found myself relating a lot to the symptoms and behaviors of ADHD. I will probably reach out for a diagnosis eventually, but I am dying to understand a bit better about myself and why I am this way.   So for those who know they have ADHD, have you struggled socially to keep up with friends? I often find myself overwhelmed by getting maybe 9 snapchats or 5 texts at at time, and I'll put off answering these messages for at least a few hours to a day or so.   Is this just an antisocial trait? Or does ADHD contribute heavily to this?
b192fe018ebcc047209e0961fade74599953877ed5b449f28bdfd56950953b12;;;A list of things I have accomplished after just ONE YEAR of acknowledging and treating my ADHD;;;• Started my master’s after 3 years of saying “I’m going to start my master’s next semester!” • Moved into a new apartment after leaving an abusive relationship • Went on a date with my FIRST crush (I was 11, he was 16 and played in our church band and looked like a Jonas Brother- I was sold) • Started completing my graduate work on time • Became the lead first grade teacher at a new school • Went to Disneyland with the boy mentioned above, who I now live with • Got ENGAGED to said boy • Found the perfect puppy with now fiancé • Finished my master’s degree with a 4.0  Not saying I give all of the credit to my meds, but WOW what a difference a year of actually taking care of myself made.   We accept the love we think we deserve.  EDIT: THANK YOU ALL!!! Your words of encouragement and congratulations mean more than you’ll ever know, especially today. Although I only mentioned the positive things that went on over the past year, please know that there have been plenty of obstacles I have struggled to overcome as well.  Being a teacher during this time has taken a much bigger toll on my mental health than anticipated. So much of my motivation comes from my desire to set the best example for my students. I’ve felt unmotivated and unnecessary these past few weeks.   I wrote this post to remind myself that I have every right to be proud of myself, even if no one else notices.   Thank you for noticing. You’ve brought back my motivation.   PS- While I don’t feel comfortable discussing my diagnosis process/medication (as I know everyone is different and I wouldn’t ever want to mislead anyone), please know that too had absolutely NO idea what I was doing going into this a year ago. I literally just googled therapists near me, talked about my concerns, was sent to another doctor and prescribed medication. I know this won’t be the case for everyone, but my best advice would be to research specialists in your area!
e5b5f0d3274e8f1db969d926ea292b0365221b0ce461ecb678160d21c60bc3e5;;;Tired of my mind treating simple tasks as tragedies to overcome;;;Washing face, changing before bed, doing laundry.. i have to give myself a pep talk every time I have to do something. It’s absurd.   Also, I’m trying to do an online course now during quarantine, so it requires some academic reading. I love the subject and it’s great not to have to go out and meet people. It’s a little easier to focus this way (i could never even start one without the quarantine). But every book chapter and every article takes hours and hours. I get distracted all the time and have to read each paragraph over and over again like an idiot. It’s like I’m back in school again, homework was such a nightmare that would take hours of mainly spacing out.   I’m 25 with an art degree and wish to pursue a science degree next, which is why I’m taking the online course. But if this is how it will be there’s no way I’ll manage it.    EDIT: what an overwhelming response, guys, thank you for this. It’s very encouraging to read some of your stories of success and continuous struggle. So much good and diverse advice that I already started trying to implement to see what works for me. I’m wishing you all to achieve your goals. Love Reddit.
f8dd1ca7a155ddcbe678f832ce4291087092e45d70c81a9caac61ea1dd4857fa;;;I need 5 minutes of your time to STOP THE FDA FROM MAKING IT HARDER TO GET ADHD MEDS!;;;Sorry this is very "talking to non-ADHD brains" but I'm copypasta'ing b/c the more comments we get opposing this earlier on the easier it'll be to *STOP THIS*  THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT: PLEASE SHARE! COMMENTS (anyone living in the US can comment!) ARE DUE BY 11/19/19 AT 11:59PM EASTERN!  The FDA is asking for public comment as they consider moving the stimulant market (ritalin, adderall, vyvanse, etc) towards "abuse deterrent formulations." ANYONE who is on these meds or knows someone who is should know IT IS EXTREMELY HARD TO REFILL PRESCRIPTIONS FOR THESE RIGHT NOW. I have hand a PHYSICAL SCRIP to the pharmacist every month (my pharmacy, a nationwide chain, doesn't 'hold' ADHD scrips) & I cannot turn it in MORE THEN A DAY EARLY. I \*also\* MUST be seen by my pdoc every 3 months, but if I get a new one I'll have to go back to EVERY MONTH.  If you follow me you also know the past 3 weeks without my Adderall have been HELL because on top of the PARALYZING executive dysfunction I get MAJORLY DEPRESSED (which is what I was \*originally\* diagnosed with - many adults w/ADHD are, ESP AFAB & FEMMES). (And don't get me started on how executive dysfunction makes remembering things like "date I need to refill" HARD AF.)  Disabled healthcare lawyer & activist Matthew Cortland [wrote up a commenting guide](https://www.patreon.com/posts/31604740).  >"FDA's request for public comment is a preliminary step the agency is taking before it engages in any further action (including formal rulemaking). Submitting a public comment now is your opportunity to ensure FDA knows about your concerns before the regulatory train picks up steam.   >   >The notice leads me to believe that FDA is considering a course of action that could potentially lead to a crack-down on stimulants like ritalin and adderall.    >   >On what basis do I reach this conclusion? Among other factors, FDA's constant invocations in their notice of opioid abuse and their comparison of the regulatory treatment of opioids to stimulants."  &#x200B;  PLEASE COMMENT. Even if it's just \*1\* sentence saying how this is bullshit (not like that though) is better then nothing. It'll take you 5 minutes & will help MILLIONS.  We need to STOP criminalizing NECESSARY MEDICATIONS & THOSE WHO NEED THEM. Chronic pain patients have suffered enough due to the "handling" of opioids, resulting in DEATH. THIS NEEDS TO END. MEDICATION IS MEDICATION!

The last weeks, I have been looking at this subreddit as one of my sources to try to figure out if I could have ADHD.   And I was shocked...  When people ask questions, other people answer them, instead of telling them they're idiots. When people share something about their lives, other people say weird stuff like "thanks for sharing" and "good luck" instead of finding some way of offending them.  At this point I'm not even sure I really believe that this is actually Reddit...  Edit: oh wow thank you for the awards! I really just pointed something obvious out but thanks!  Edit 2: Ok this is officially the best place on the internet...  Edit 3: Ok y’all being silly with those awards now!
a872d00940a739b924327dd41d500a173683f602f287df287ee458694b5453e6;;;THATS a symptom too?!;;;Okay so, I have a MASTERS DEGREE in neuroscience, and I was diagnosed 5 years ago (during my undergrad of neuroscience), and I SOMEHOW must have missed the day in class/skimmed over that part when I was writing MULTIPLE papers on ADHD that explained this, but I JUST LEARNED the other day that trouble regulating emotions is an ADHD thing too!  HOW DID I MISS THAT.   DUH.  THAT MAKES SO MUCH SENSE.  Here I was, thinking I must have some sort of borderline personality disorder or hormonal imbalance or something else wrong with me because I have these WILD mood fluctuations in response to good or bad things happening.  ITS THE FLIPPING ADHD FOLKS!  OF COURSE. If we can't inhibit impulsive behaviours like talking out of turn and whatnot, how could we expect to inhibit expressing our EMOTIONS?!   When normal people experience something that makes them upset, they can use their prefrontal cortex to calm themselves down, or at least push the feelings away until they are alone and can express them without causing a scene. Whereas we just FEEL ALL THE FEELINGS and either cry or rage out accordingly until something else catches our attention! No wonder I've always been garbage at self soothing!! Because that's an executive inhibition thing!!  DUH!  Ugh, guys. So much makes sense now. How did I not know this? How did I miss this in all my classes, research, and explainations from the doctors when I was diagnosed? Also the ADHD I guess 😅
aecc97a7964aff50e1280b9e23cfd1f24c796f2f3d4f2f1ed66dbf91da882171;;;I'm a "high functioning" professional with ADHD. And yet I'm having an episode and have come to a total standstill, with paralyzing anxiety.;;;I just need to get this out in a community that understands.  I am reasonably high functioning, with a good professional job and life that from the outside looks decently put together.  But I'm crumbling right now.  I wake up every morning and I can't move.  The anxiety sits on my chest like a massive lazy animal.  All of the steps toward getting through the day are there in my head - sit up, bathe, get dressed, breakfast, log in to work, the work tasks for the day.  They aren't hard.  But I sit there.  I'll do anything not to face these simple tasks.  And to face, by extension, the uncertainty of whether I'll succeed or fail at them, and the endless experience of failure and disappointment in myself - from me and from others.  I'm feeling crushed by the constant experience of being unable to rely on myself.  Of every moment, setting out to do a task, or a series of small steps.  And not knowing if I will, in fact, do what I'm calling on myself to do.  Setting a goal feels like setting myself up for failure.  Sitting there pulling out one coping mechanism after another.  Break it down into baby steps!  Put on a playlist!  Change your environment!  Speak the next step out loud!  Get up from your chair and write down the next step while walking around!  Do 10 push ups!  Work for 10 minutes, then take a break!  Like a parent working to keep their voice patient while reasoning with a toddler that has thrown themselves down in the middle of the sidewalk and refuses to move.  Sometimes in fits and starts, these things work.  Sometimes they still don't.  It's exhausting, these constant coping mechanisms and ra-ra coaching in my head to slog through very simple tasks.    I was diagnosed in middle age.  I think, to some extent in the modern world, most of us sometimes feel like life is little more than an endless to do list.  But I now understand better why my life has always felt like a perpetual unfinished to do list.  With the ADHD I have more trouble than usual transitioning appropriately between one task and another.  I have a lot of trouble putting the appropriate amount of work on any given task - starting the task, evaluating it, understanding how much effort is worthwhile and what is too much or too little, planning out the microsteps in the task, moving through them without getting stuck or sidetracked or spending way too long on one and being unable to engage with the next, and then, the hardest part, know how wrap up and finish.  To know when the task is appropriately done, and not overdone and not underdone, whether I put in enough effort and focus to do it will enough but not so much that.  And even if I can figure that out - can I DO it.  This is constant.  And it multiplies exponentially over the course of each hour, each task, each project, each day.  It's particularly hard because I'm just feeling the weight of all the ways I feel I've let people down recently and over the long term.  I want to come out of the closet with ADHD.  I want to rail at the world, to say, yes, I need to take responsibility but I also need you to understand why there are bumps and hiccups along the way.  I need you to understand that I'm trying when it looks like I'm not.  I know what it would sound like if I did, though.  My husband understands \*better\* than he used to, but there's still a suspicion, it still doesn't make sense to him, and we struggle under the weight of all my perceived letdowns since long before I was diagnosed.  I also feel like I might be feeling too much weight there, more than actually exists.  That I might be suffocating under the weight of these perceived judgements, and withdrawing from people, long after they have moved on from the original issue.    Mindfulness is supposed to be good for us, and in some ways it is.  But mindfulness is also a trap.  If I'm too mindful, I might fall deeply into the experience of doing one thing, so deeply that I'll lose track of time or risk missing the next thing I was supposed to do.  I'm always terrified when I have to take a shower in the morning, for instance, that I will forget utterly that I am on a schedule to get out the door.  The outside world and the clock will melt away and I'll just be there, in the experience of the shower, playing with my soaps, singing, considering how thoroughly to exfoliate my toes.  Then I'll be late to work AGAIN.   So I'm constantly vigilant and anxious instead.  I'm suffering.  The vigilance and anxiety are double edged swords.  In part I've developed them as a result of so many failures, to help keep me on my toes.  My brain constantly reminding "what about this task?  What about THAT task?  what about all the tasks out there that I can't remember right this moment?  They're out there waiting to strike, you need to somehow get a handle on them."  But I can't organize the whatabouts.  There's the constant jumping, from minute detail of this task to minute detail of that task.    I feel confident that there is a better way.  I feel confident that there is a way to accept the struggle a bit more.  To accept that I am this way and I'll do my best within and I'll find the best ways I can to work within my strengths and weaknesses.  The way forward is to set one small goal and allow myself to struggle and meander toward it.  It's very hard for me to hold just one thing, just one task in my head at a time.  I'll get sidetracked, impulsively put it down mentally without even realizing it.  In fact, I shouldn't expect that I won't.  I need to figure out a way for that to be OK.  Because I still do get a lot of things done.  But it just seems like it's never OK, with anyone else or in turn, with me internally.  I never have time to practice this better way, because the to do list keeps spinning faster that I can keep up.  And every time I get closer to being OK with it, someone else's disappointment brings my entire history of failure crashing down on my head again.  But I'm also angry a lot with the people close to me recently, in part because this whole history seems to crash down with every interaction.  So I'm just shut down right now.  I've refused to do anything this weekend.  It's not good.  That's why they thought I just had depression for thirty odd years.  Pretty soon I'll pick it up again and try to work toward that better way again.    Thanks for listening.  EDIT: Sincerest thanks to everyone who has read and commented.  I am feeling better just to have gotten this off my chest and to have connected with other folks in the same boat.  SECOND EDIT: Dang. This blew up in a quite unexpected way. I'm sorry that I can't respond to all comments, but I am slowly reading through them all and really appreciate the conversation, understanding, and tips everyone is sharing.  And while I'm not happy to hear that so many people are having the same problems, I feel very heard - and I am glad if this post could make others feel heard too. I shared my post with my husband to try and help articulate what is happening in each moment and how it affects me, and he was thankful and I think able to understand a bit better.  Moreover, I worked today, and while (shocker) I still have ADHD, I was able to let go of so much shame by posting, which gave me more space just to deal with my mind and tasks as they came up, and it went better.  So thank you all very much again.

I also see that both of us are shamed when this happen, but because we both have it, we can be cool with it.   Does anyone else have a cool relationship with someone who also got ADHD ?

Went through the drive through, get to the window to pay, reach for my wallet in my back pocket, no wallet.     I momentarily panic, then I remember, Apple Pay!  I don’t know how to use Apple Pay. Luckily the girl working the window did, we get it figured out. She hands me back my phone, I feel like I handled the crisis well. I found a solution without panicking and just giving up.      Then I look down, there between my legs, is my wallet. This is where I always put my wallet when I go through the drive through so I’m not reaching for it at the window. I always put it there, yet somehow completely spaced and forgot.  My brain then goes from that feeling of accomplishment, to feelings of annoyance.  I laughed about it with my fiancé later, but still... wtf brain.

I finally got diagnosed with ADHD at 29 after a string of misdiagnosis... everything from GAD to Bipolar, depression, OCD. No medication has ever worked for me whatsoever.  After a year of struggling with FMLA for panic attacks at work, which I realize now were anxiety from a lack of productivity etc, my new psychiatrist in Nashville (i recently moved and was forced to find a new one) suggested maybe these other conditions were just symptoms/coping mechanisms/learned behavioral patterns from ADHD.  It was like a light bulb. I’m sad I didn’t know sooner. But a few days with proper medication and I feel like a completely different human being. I can’t believe it.  If you feel like your diagnosis isn’t right please don’t give up. Find a doctor that really listens to you and your whole story and doesn’t just pull out a script pad 5 min in.  I feel like my entire life is about to change.
daa0df4f32e8003975fb73fab5140d7b0dfe50e661d5ead00312a077de212d37;;;Why am I doing this: Avoiding to go to bed for hours and rather sitting for hours on end scrolling through nonsense internet info.;;;Like yesterday we finished watching a movie at 9:30 pm, partner went to bed - it took 5 minutes to them. Meanwhile I stay seated, kinda mind stuck, scrolling through the internet, Reddit, Instagram, tiktok, Reddit again, some stupid addicting internet game but only half an hour, Instagram again endless videos of people putting nail polish on, cutting hair, pressure washing, then a documentary on YouTube about crimes, medical disorders, societal events, the super nanny, and so on and so on.   I did this for more than 5 hours!   I don't even want to do it. Like I was excited it was so early so I could catch a good nights rest because I was kinda exhausted already but here I was, watching hair cutting fails at 3 am in the morning?! why?!?   I thought it had to do with stuff you had to "organize" around before going to bed like dish washer, coffee machine timer, showering, hair washing, tooth brushing... but even when I manage to get all of that done, I come back to the couch on my phone and continue?! or even when I would allow myself to just go straight to bed without doing anything prior - no, scrolling through the internet it is.  Like, I would even have a computer and if I would at least use it instead of my smartphone I could be able to watch Netflix while researching the black dahlia murder and playing the mobile game on my phone simultaneously while ordering my father's birthday present. I would even have a bigger screen and a mouse and a keyboard, it would be so much more comfortable?! but no, I'm on my smart phone.   Like I'm exhausted, I cannot sleep in because of work. I had such a bad headache today from sleep deprivation. but yet again it's 1 am an I'm still sitting here. ugh.   this has to be an ADHD thing?! does anyone know this too? has anyone overcome this?!?  why am I like this?  .  .  .  .  Update:  Thank you for all of your comments (and the awards). I've read every single one of them and honestly makes me not feel so alone. ❤️   I also actually didn't realize there are so many others doing the exact same thing. sometimes, with adhders, I feel like being in a big tribe full of lively, bubbly kindred spirits that I belong to. ❤️  I've went from a lot of self hatred and self-criticism to "this is okay. **I** am okay. I just have this neurological executive function disorder that I have to deal with. I'm not a bad person."
c6096d25bb99fb12598a0fb7725ff3d6dbd56e863a9dfa7d57cd197c43de4927;;;Didn't realize my boss was helping me until today;;;Awhile ago my boss put two and two together and figured out I have ADHD. The first time I told her she implied that she knew, I guess I'm that obvious. Anyway, she's been helping me with time management and always emails me follow ups. She let me borrow a book about prioritizing tasks and has given tips on how she organizes. She has an open door if I'm not sure what the best thing to work at the time would be. She's always been big on emailing things but she always sends me reminders on things. For example, this week I have to take my lunch outside of my routine and she set up a reminder on my calendar for me. When we did the office remodel she deliberately put my new cube alllllll the way in the back, away from people, in a very quiet corner of the office.  So, I've been having issues with a co-worker and began feeling spiteful. Me, being the asshole I am, started looking up accomodations for my ADHD and epilepsy. After doing research, they've been doing this for me all along and it actually makes me really happy. I just wanted to share how happy it made me and how much better I feel about my job. They set me up for success without me realizing it. :) I've been keeping her in the loop on my treatment because they've been changing my meds so I've been moody with coworkers so it's been noticed. I'm just really happy right now.
e749ed9c4f448b1f6ab4d67cb4ad7cc988a26a507f666d9883729c077c41279b;;;Best friend laughed at my diagnosis and said "modern technology has made everyone ADHD. 99% of people who get a diagnosis are perfectly fine, just taking the easy way out". How do you deal with those you trust doubting or minimizing your diagnosis?;;;Diagnosed at 29 after a lifelong brain struggle and an avalanche of family members diagnosed this winter/spring (brother at 26, mom at 62, maternal aunt at 64). This week was my first on adderall, and it feels like my brain finally works right! It’s a big adjustment for my brain and body, but I feel like it’s working. That said, I’ve been dealing with a LOT of self-doubt on my diagnosis now that I have it—a lot of “what if I don’t actually have it, I’m just anxious and depressed and lazy and unfocused and self-indulgent and messy and selfish because really I just suck as a person??”  I was catching up with one of my best friends last night, someone who has known me since I was 16, knows me better than almost anyone else in the world—hell we even dated on and off when we were 17-21, so he’s been intimately aware of a LOT of my disordered patterns and thinking. I thought he’d be supportive when I told him my diagnosis, would be like “wow, that actually makes SO much sense!” like my mother and boyfriend and sister were. But instead, he LAUGHED at me, and said “well, we all have a little ADHD!”  He went into kind of a rant about how modern technology makes us ALL unable to properly focus, how being exposed to screens since birth and smart phones since our teen years has rewired our brains and altered our reward centers. How “doping up” little boys in Ritalin in the 90’s and early 2000’s has been proven to have destroyed a generation of men with needless medication. How I haven’t done enough research before “gleefully altering \[my\] brain chemistry, with no knowledge of how permanent it could be”. He wasn’t trying to say that actual ADHD doesn’t exist, but that “99% of people diagnosed with ADHD have nothing wrong with them, it’s a fad diagnosis, and those issues can be fixed with exercise and cognitive behavioral therapy. Those people are wrecking their brains so they can take the easy way out.” He added that his younger half brother was just diagnosed at 14 and put on meds, and “in a few years he’ll get to college and discover coffee and realize he was actually fine the whole time.”  I was so, so, so upset. It was like he reached into my brain, pulled out all of my worries and self-doubt around my diagnosis, and read them back to me point by point. I trust his perspective immensely, both as an incredibly logical and thoughtful person and as someone who has known me so well since I was practically still in braces. I just cannot get his voice out of my head now. What if he’s right? What if I’m permanently wrecking my actually healthy brain chemistry? I’m torn between being angry with my friend and appreciative of his bluntness, which I normally really appreciate about him.   Has anyone else had this experience? Especially any other adult women? My brother had the “oh, it all makes so much sense now!” reaction from his friends and our loved ones when he was diagnosed, since he’s always had trouble with school and impulse regulation. But I get the “well you’ve always been doing fine? You have a house and a career and a great education? Are you really SURE its not just the crippling anxiety everyone knows you have??”   How do you deal with people doubting you? How do you explain the crippling and lifelong internal struggle when, outwardly, you were able to build a perfectly healthy and successful life without a diagnosis and meds?
dc937b59892604f5a86ac96936cd7ff09e25f18ae6b758e8014a24c7fa039e91;;;The analogy that finally got my colleague to understand...;;;I was chatting with a work colleague this morning while making tea, and he saw me pop my morning pill as I took my first slurp from the mug... so naturally we got onto the subject of ADHD.  This is the analogy I used to describe it:  "Imagine a big bowl of spaghetti, that's my natural thought processes.  Each task that needs to be done during the day is a single strand of spaghetti, and these strands need to be unravelled before work can be done, and then consumed individually so as not to get tangled up again.  Also, if I get interrupted while unravelling, all remaining work tangles up into one big mass again.  And potentially more spaghetti now surrounds it, so the original strands are completely buried and forgotten about.  The hardest part however, is not so much the actual unravelling, but finding the ends of the spaghetti so I can even get started.  If I get interrupted or distracted, the ends get lost."  "So what does the tablet help with?"  "Mainly, it helps to highlight the ends of the strands.  It doesn't help much with the actual unravelling process, I'm actually quite good at that - once I've found the ends!  God knows, I've had plenty of practice, I've been unravelling all my life."  I think that sums it up quite nicely.  Keep unravelling,  Jon - ADHD (Primarily Inattentive)
f77a53bb96f0b086c8a1c8b7eddf8fefcb7c5b9c70486473b97d53ccbee1dabb;;;For me, the hardest thing about having ADHD is that no one wants to hear “You know, I do have ADHD” when you’re late or forget something;;;Last night I went to bed early to make sure I got enough sleep.  Mind raced and made it difficult to get a full eight hours but hey, better than I would have gotten if I didn’t go to bed early.  This morning my alarm went off more than two hours before work.  I snoozed it a couple times.  I’ve started this thing where I’m trying to meditate an hour each morning.  Well, I snoozed so much that I’ll only be able to get 45 minutes in but hey that’s better than nothing.  I start getting ready for work after meditating.  I’ve only let myself have enough time to do most of what I need to do before work, but hey, it’s better than nothing.  It’s about time I should leave now, my work shirt is on the bed and I remind myself to grab it and the frozen burritos before I leave for work.  The wife reminds me for a second time to let the dogs out before work.  I sigh and then reprimand myself internally for sighing at her.  I let the dogs out, get the burritos out of the freezer and put them on the kitchen counter, grab my sidebag, get in the car and head to work.  At my first stop light I remember that I forgot the frozen burritos.  I get to work.  I’m only two minutes late.  That’s good for me.  As I’m walking inside I realize I’m not wearing my work shirt.  It’s still on the bed at home.  I tell my co-worker that I forgot my shirt and have to head home to go get it.  My wife is nice enough to put my work shirt and the frozen burritos in a place that’s easy for me to get when i get home.  I get home and I remember that there’s a cup upstairs I want to grab because I use it to get free drinks next door to my work.  I grab it, the burritos and the shirt and leave.  I get to work and my supervisor is passive aggressively up my ass about being late and how I forgot my shirt.  He knows I have ADHD and I get defensive and against my better judgment I say: “You know I have this thing called ADHD that makes it hard for me to remember things.”  He says: “Oh that’s just an excuse.”    Me, even more agitated: “No, it’s not.  It’s an actual reason.”  Him: “You could have put it in your car last night.”  I walk away, quickly get myself to calm down, walk back to my supervisor and say: “I am sorry for being late.”  Fuck having ADHD.  My life revolves managing this condition.  Planning around this condition.  And I can never, ever bring it up for any kind of sympathy or understanding.  It’s always just an “excuse”.

My manager turned the corner into my cubicle, and there I am sitting at my desk closely inspecting two bottlecaps and clicking them together like a caveman who discovered flint rocks. I was actually doing some detective work, realizing I had two Hydroflasks made in two different years (\~2018 and 2019), and their special "insulated" cap seems to be made differently between those two years. I was tapping though together and noticed one of them seemed more hollow than the other and the newer one is more textured on the rubber handle (Probably just normal usage/weathering). I didn't get to figure out whether the newer one was higher/lower quality than the previous year's, or exactly why the hollow one was heavier than the other.  He stared at what I was doing for probably 2-3 seconds before I noticed him. Fortunately I wasn't behind on any work, and there wasn't anything to be criticized of me besides the fact that I was getting paid for investigating Hydroflask's design changes.  I think next time I'll make sure I don't double up day and run out of my prescription a day early.  Thanks for reading, let's finish this week strong :)  EDIT: [Thought I might include a picture of what the bottlecap I was so intrigued by.](https://i.imgur.com/Zz16NbB.jpg)  EDIT2: I woke up to this post blowing up - I'm leaving all of my typos in, and you're all beautiful people - remember, amongst our flaws we all have unique strengths in some aspect :)

ef5e811bbc6592d9dd2c523901fbed96ac0c1a9ad4249bc9c933580db326e915;;;I heard someone use the word ‘disability’ regarding ADHD for the first time;;;I’ve always sort of known something was off with myself, I went from being a musically gifted, young, creative person to someone who couldn’t get out of bed in the morning because everything was so much mental effort. I got my official diagnosis at the beginning of this year &amp; have had my ups and downs but am generally doing okay with meds and making good routines for myself.   I recently had a 1-on-1 with one of my managers who also has adhd, and we were talking about how things were going with me (super grateful for this support in the workplace). He reminded me that it’s okay to feel overwhelmed, because I have a disability, and that I should give myself lots of grace. I think it was at that moment that it hit me that my suspicions were true &amp; that I had actually gotten a diagnosis and that something was wrong with me. Something that I CAN manage, but nevertheless, I felt totally sunk. I still haven’t felt ok since. Before my diagnosis, I wanted to figure out what was wrong, but now I just want to pretend it never happened &amp; that my adhd doesn’t exist.   Ugh. I literally just want a month off life to get my shit together.  EDIT: I feel so uplifted by reading the comments right now, thank you to everyone sharing their experiences and knowledge. This community is incredible...such amazing support. Thank u.  With love, a random Canadian. ♥
7bfa4cccfcffcb1539f1a3b08c129ec60eee923195c664bcb15cc4a3c31da8df;;;Succeeding in class doesn't mean they don't have ADHD;;;Today, I was just reminded of a few incidents at the doctor's office when I was a child. I am just so mad that no one listened to me.     For background: In elementary/middle school, I was considered "talented" and excelled in class. I am now 18f and in college. I only got diagnosed at 17.  &#x200B;  Every year I would have to go to the doctor's office for a physical. At around 11 years of age, we had to fill out a form ourselves about how we were doing in school/medical history/etc. In the section about the school, I checked off how I had trouble focusing and sitting still, along with trouble in school.  After I'm done, I'm called in for my physical with my mom. My doctor then questions me about me having trouble focusing and I explain how I can't sit still, have trouble paying attention, and how school was very taxing to attend. We go over my grades, and they are great and I'm doing fine in school. She is then sort of patronizing to me, explaining how I'm just smart and not being challenged enough in class. I was lucky I wasn't my brother with severe ADHD, etc. She blows by it and doesn't look any deeper, basically saying I was just talented and almost accusing me of looking for attention.  While I knew it wasn't exactly me being bored in class, I listened anyway. Anytime I had trouble focusing, I would just chalk it up to me being lazy or dumb or tired. Anytime I saw one of those "if you've been diagnosed with ADHD you do these things" and while I'd check and see I 100% was like that, I *couldn't* have ADHD. I was fine. I was l just looking for attention and lazy and stupid.    This turned me into thinking ADHD was fake (Wild, I know). I thought everyone had trouble like me, and only the people searching for attention were diagnosed. They were dumb and didn't even have ADHD/barely affected them. ADHD was just a lack of attention. Just, focus! Right? It's that easy.   Years passed and I got diagnosed with anxiety and depression, but still struggled to the point of hospitalization. I thought I was broken. I was just lazy or stupid. I wasn't strong enough and the fact I couldn't sit down was all me. I was supposed to be cured and my grades rose back up- but only slightly. I didn't have ADHD because I could sit down for a whole day without eating or going to the bathroom and read a book. Isn't that super focused?  It took until I was 17 to finally be diagnosed by a psychiatrist- and it was only after a dumb joke I made about still not focusing on studying for the SATs. It felt like everything just came together. I did have ADHD. ADHD wasn't fake, I was the one that had been struggling the whole time. I wasn't broken or crazy. I'm pretty sure I full-on sobbed with relief in my room after.  Yet, I still feel the effects of that doctor's visit. I still have internalized stigma about ADHD and have trouble asking for help. I'm worried that I'm just faking having ADHD or that since I wasn't diagnosed I had a very mild case and shouldn't even need help.   &#x200B;  Doctors need to listen more. If a child, even if they are doing great, thinks something is wrong *it is probably wrong.*  By not listening, you might've set that child up for a lifetime of feeling like they are broken. And just because they were female at birth doesn't mean they couldn't have ADHD too. The symptoms are less outwards, but that doesn't discount their struggles or feelings.    TLDR: Wasn't diagnosed with ADHD but when I brought it up at the doctors they said no because I was gifted. This left me with internalized stigma.   Edit: Thank you for all the love and awards! I've tried to fix some of the spelling errors but I'm bad at rereading and fixing conjugation after I rewrite a sentence. But all of your responses are touching and while I can't respond to them all, I've read them all. :)
94f48d0f82435679527566ab30f4dc5d96d229d6f8f2c77f0d74196f7d8cc905;;;I always forget/doubt that I have ADHD and blame my symptoms on lack of intelligence/innate flaws/anxiety/early dementia (lol);;;I seriously beat myself up all the time for my ADHD symptoms and only every now and then do I accept that I have ADHD and feel a bit better about myself. I know I have a diagnosis and take meds but I still feel this way. I was diagnosed at 17 (23 now) and I just feel like I can’t get over what my explanations were for it in the past (feeling stupid). I’ve accomplished a lot (double majored in molecular biology and neuroscience) but I still feel like an idiot and a loser. I still struggle to learn, it takes forever for me to get through training at work and I feel like my coworkers think I’m dumb. I always think that adhd is an excuse I’ve made up for myself...
68069c8e851228472dc71c25793ea19d0542b342e4268bc44723ae25646760cd;;;What a wonderful day to yeet myself out a window;;;My boss wanted to talk to me about something this morning, so we went for a walk around the block.   He's introducing me to the new bonus system. I ask intelligent question. We have a nice conversation. I feel like a confident young professional.   Enter the fucking squirrel running across the street in front of us.   I deadass yell: "Oh, look, a squirrel!"  It's been nice knowing you guys. Tell my cat, I love her.   Goodbye, cruel world.
f954f368eedf6d436c873e7bd53b17be90c284d9239a6f3f38903dfaf26ecbc6;;;I think having undiagnosed ADHD both sets us up for abuse, *and* puts us at a greater risk of being abusive partners and/or parents. I was 43 before I truly realised my parents are shit.;;;First, if our parents are neurotypical, and we have neurotypical siblings, we're the odd one, and are often blamed for things.  So we grow up with shame and inferiority not just from society, but from our parents.  Then as parents we may repeat the blaming that we grew up with. Not doing it is a heroic effort: we need to know what is a better way, we need to monitor ourself a lot, and we need a very good partner.  If one or both our parents are undiagnosed ADHDers, we may have grown up with being yelled at for small issues just because our parents were tired.  We may have grown up with a lot of gasslighting  because our parent(s) didn't remember what happened.  They may have given us their own shame and feelings of shortcomings.  They may have been to exhausted to help us regulate our own emotions and all the other executive functioning issues we struggle with.  They may have been in denial about our diagnosis because to them we're normal.   They may have refused us meds, or when we became zombies, didn't work to change our dosis or try new meds.  Many parents are great ofc, but what about us who had bad or even horrible parents?   Add undiagnosed ADHD to the general behaviour of narcissists and other entitled people, and we're twice screwed.  And if we're in a relationship with a covert narcissist, we may be easier to gaslight because of our poorer short term memory.  We may be quicker to forget how bad things are.  And we may struggle to learn from our mistakes.  My life, basically, before diagnosis and meds. Both my parents are undiagnosed ADHDers.   My stepdad is that guy everybody loves who treats his family like shit. My biodad was so awful my mum believe my stepdad is an angel. I was the scapegoat, and both my brother and halfbrother are entitled shits.   It sucks having ADHD and zero support from your family because they're either too selfish or too self-absorbed to care about anyone but themself, no matter how much you've done for them.  EDIT: Thank you kind stranger for my first ever award!  Edit: Thanks so much for all your comments, I'm reading them but can't answer everyone because kids, sleep, life.   Parenting IS hard, but if we don't admit our mistakes and apologise to our children, we're a bad example and we just pass our shit on to them. I'm not a saint, I could write a very thick book about all the bad parenting mistakes I've done. Thanks to all of you who try so hard to do better, you are amazing!

881ed7caf62e1c3bec31551cc2be8fe2fd185637b4ab3c4a8f0464a5ece1e058;;;Having ADHD can make you feel like you don’t really love the things you are passionate about.;;;I’m sorry to everyone who has to experience this. ADHD has the potential to make you feel like a shell of your former self if left undiagnosed too long. I know a lot of you have talked about how you used to love to read and now it’s so hard to even pick up a book.   That’s why I wish it was more widely discussed so that people could understand more about what this really is. Nobody deserves this, but to those who live with this everyday, I love and appreciate you all. You’re the real MVPs.
c62e8ee1e9a99c513fb61158ef4eec4f39ffd517d567efd07fabd2bd501f40c6;;;I’ve never felt more connected to a community of people in 5 seconds or less than I did the moment I opened this sub.;;;Edit: Thank you for the Gold! It’s my first one! I fell asleep accidentally and here I am 5 hours later but I can’t say how much all of your replies mean to me. It’s so nice to hear that I’m not the only one with a game that occasionally crashes.     I (22M) kind of feel lost in life right now. It’s been rough for a long time and no one has really been able to understand how exactly it’s going wrong, including myself. It’s really hard to describe to others how my mind works and really hard to figure out time management and really hard to not feel like I’m literally slipping through time because it can move so quickly or leaving myself notes and alarms and notifications so I can remember basic things.   People I had worked with in the past had slipped comments wondering if I “autistic because I talk so much about random facts” and at a more recent job, a coworker of mine overheard me telling my assistant manager about my fear of running out of time and over the course of getting to know her, noticed my quirks and one day pulled me aside and suggested she thinks I have ADHD and wanted to let me know because we had gotten pretty close. She described her symptoms and what they meant for her and what she’s learned and I cried.   Flash forward to now a couple months later I’m feeling so lost and I remembered that this community might be a thing. I opened this sub and saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/akp6iz/the_contradictory_nature_of_adhd/?st=JRW6DIUS&sh=f5bd58e6) by u/emerald_soleil. I started crying. And then I kept reading. And I keep reading things that people do that I do that my ex was so critical of and I feel less crazy. And I feel like I’ve rambled on but I just wanted to share that it’s nice to know there’s others out there
6543bad3748d2106d88f3df08f6471c655cb0bab346991a6fd15f426fd12dd90;;;ADHD isn't "trendy" or "cute";;;I (f14) was diagnosed with ADHD in October last year. I was so excited about it, things were making so much *sense,* for the first time ever.  Since then, I've been noticing weird patterns.  Whenever I tell someone I have ADHD, the response seems to be along the lines of  "That's really not a big deal" or "I'm sooo ADHD sometimes too."  I've tried to explain that it's not, like, a quirky personality trait for you to have, but nobody seems to really care? I think a big part of it is TikTok. People are making videos that get millions of views of their 'ADHD moments' where they get distracted in the middle of doing something or essentially just say random shower thoughts as if they didn't steal them from reddit/tumblr/twitter.  It's always sort of irritated me, but lately it's been REALLY getting on my nerves, because now whenever I say "I have ADHD" or bring it up at all, I can feel people judging me. Someone ranted at me because they said I was faking it for attention. It's literally just the most irritating thing, I wish people stopped using it as a joke or trend or whatever.  &#x200B;  Edit: Okay, I definitely didn't expect this to blow up so much! Thankyou for all of the amazing messages and replies I've gotten, it's really amazing to hear how this affects so many people. That being said, I do want to clear something up:  I promise I'm not starting every conversation with "I have ADHD" (though in retrospect I understand how people might have thought that) It was more when I was first diagnosed, I was being taken out of class often (3 times a week at least) to talk to my Psychologist, or by the school, and it hadn't really occurred to me at that time that ADHD was something most people kept hidden. If someone asked me where I'd been I pretty much just told them as it seemed like a natural thing to do (and honestly I still don't really want to keep it a secret.)
a028b7491ef7f0deb95d86b5a9a3ed20ab77f2e0566d909d6b7f040e12f4c92f;;;I've always despised the 'oh squirrel!' comment;;;One of the most frustrating things about ADHD is some people understand it. The middle of the sentence break away to something random.  At least for me, it isn't random at all. Part of ADHD for me is what I call hyper-relationships. The best example I can think of right now is when a friend and I were standing in line at Starbucks a while back. We saw the newspaper and it mentioned a Tornado on the front. My friend started talking about it but I seemed zoned out so he asked with I was thinking about and I said Martians.  He was confused and asked why in the world I was thinking of Martians. From his point of view, it was totally random.  And I explained to him: the newspaper mentioned tornadoes. Tornadoes made me think of hurricanes, which made me think of Katrina. Katrina made me think of New Orleans and Louisiana, which made me think of my 5th grade class when we talked about the Mississippi River and the delta into the Gulf of Mexico. Delta made me think of rockets, like the delta V. But there is a problem with the V, it won't get us to Mars. We would need something bigger, and I wonder what we will find there. Probably some microbe fossils of ancient Martian microbes.  But all of that happened in maybe a second or two.  This is what it is for me, and better, this is what makes me great at my job. But people can't understand that it isn't random, and that's frustrating.  /rant  Edit: obligatory humility for my first gold or any shiney. Thank you kind redditor.  Also my job. A lot of people are asking so I figure I should say. My background is engineering and computer science, got a law degree, now I'm a Patent Attorney. These hyper-relationships are important because it allows me to look at a design, deconstruct it, and figure out ways to get around the design. E.g. What if this hinge was a bearing joint? Etc.  If I am writing the Patent application, it is important to make sure other people can't design around the app I'm writing. If I'm defending an app, it helps me to infer intent of functionality in other patents to show an argument that my design is something else and is different because x, y, z. It allows this movement not allowed there. That functionality is limited because of that device, we use this, so not limited and solves a problem. Etc.

I’m so excited, I’ve been organizing my funds and putting things into lists based on priority and even decided to CLEAN UNDER MY BED for the first time in nearly 5 years!!! I cannot wait to get everything done!!  I’ve been thinking about doing this for a while, because I turn 18 this year and I’d like legal adulthood to meet me in a more grown-up room rather than the pink and purple box my childhood self made her own. Not to mention, if i don’t go back to college this year I want somewhere to call my own and just *chill*.  I’m so excited I’ve been talking about it to anyone who’ll listen!!!!

In February I was finally diagnosed and just now received my last remaining final grade for the semester. Thanks to treatment I’ve finished this semester with a 4.0! 🎉;;;Receiving this diagnosis has opened up so many doors for me that I myself had shut and locked because I never believed I was capable of doing it. Treatment has completely transformed my ability to perform academically and I’m eternally grateful for that.   My goal is to continue earning a 4.0 so I might have a chance of getting into grad school in a couple years!🙏🏻

I want to expand on [my reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/c3ee48/the_single_most_important_thing_you_can_do_for/erqsiyu/).  &#x200B;  (Edited as I think of things to add)  # Before we dive in:  * **This might get uncomfortable.** I'm unpacking some deep stuff here. If you're in a really sad place, I suggest coming back when you feel better <3 * **All of this comes from my experience.** That means that I'm painfully aware of how this feels. It also means this might not describe you and your experience. * **I share this to help people suffer less.** If we understand what's going on, we gain power to change it. But understanding these things sometimes hurts too. I'm with you, we're in this together!  # So what about ADHD makes relationships especially hard?  **tl;dr: ADHD cripples the part of our brain responsible for social interaction.**  1. ADHD cripples a part of our brain called the prefrontal cortex (also called the frontal lobe). 2. To quote [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefrontal_cortex): "This brain region has been implicated in planning complex cognitive behavior, personality expression, decision making, and moderating social behavior." \[[source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2784035)\]  # But what does this look like in practice?  **Social incompetence fuels shame, abandonment issues, and codependent tendencies.**  * Growing up, I didn't understand when I said or did something insensitive. This sent my peers strong signals that I am an unsafe person, so they backed off. * This confused me, because nobody told me what I did. I began to feel ashamed of myself. * This also fueled fear of abandonment, which set me up for codependent tendencies: the few people who didn't run away, I latched on to and smothered. Eventually they left too, compounding abandonment issues. * I suspect this is why RSD and ADHD often come together.  **Inattention sends the message that we don't care.**  * My ADHD-PI meant things like eye contact and thoughtful listening came very difficult. People understandably received this as I'm uninterested and don't care about what they're saying. * I would frequently interrupt people mid-sentence because I couldn't wait long enough for a break in the conversation to say what I wanted. * I didn't understand the rhythm of conversation, and I couldn't remember what I wanted to say long enough to wait for an appropriate time. This feels insulting to the other person, who then withdraws. * The "common sense" people talk about — a lot of that boils down to instinctive observations that the frontal lobe handles. So without it, we miss out on all those subtle cues: body language, tone, word choice, facial expressions.  **With ADHD, it's easier to misunderstand people, and for them to misunderstand us.**  * Largely due to our crippled frontal lobe, it's hard to identify exactly what we are trying to say, and what others are saying to us. * Relationships are built on clear, consistent communication. * Simple example:    * Wife: Looks like we're out of milk.    * Me: I'm headed to the store today. \[forgets to pick up milk\]    * Wife: Did you get the milk?    * Me: \[ashamed\] no, I never said I would pick up the milk. \[technically true!\]    * Wife: Yes you did! (sigh) \[she reasonably inferred from my first reply that I would pick up the milk, even though I never said it directly\]    * \[argument ensues\] * Another example: My wife and I start talking about what we're going to do this evening. We discuss several options, their pros/cons, and how things might work out. In all the conversation, we never actually, conclusively settle on what we're doing, and each of us walk away thinking we agreed to a different plan. That evening does not go well.  **Disorganized, impulsive, and unhygienic people seem unsafe.**  * Of course, they don't know we're that way because of a neurological condition. But it triggers the same instinctual avoidance. * The worst part: it's understandable. I wouldn't want to hang out with the 8-year-old me, who brushed his teeth once a week and rarely washed his hands after using the restroom. * Our impulsiveness may seem dangerous to others, so we might get labeled as "bad kids" early on.  **Flaking out breaks trust and puts people off.**  * Again, understandable. If I'm late to the third date in a row, she might reasonably assume I don't really like her. * Worst of all, it breaks my trust in myself. If I can't trust myself, I can't trust anyone else, and relationships are built on trust.  **We can't process conversations in real-time, so we look awkward.**  * Since the part of our brain responsible for social interaction is crippled, we compensate with other parts of our brain that aren't as well-adapted to the role. This means we *can do it, just not as fast as everyone else.* * This means we often can't say what we really mean, or pause awkwardly, or suddenly lose our train of thought. * This often leads to public shame and bullying, worsening our fear of social interactions.  **We can't muster the patience and energy to maintain social norms, so we seem careless or cold.**  * We have a hard time with anything that takes focus, but doesn't produce short-term reward. Many social norms fall into this category. * For example, my grandparents frequently reminded me how much they would have appreciated a thank-you card for the countless Christmas/Birthday checks they mailed me. * People like kind surprises, gifts, notes, etc. All of this takes executive planning that we often lack.  **Social success depends on the ability to plan ahead, which we can't.**  * Most functional people need to plan things out ahead of time. But if we can't keep a schedule, we effectively exclude ourselves from these gatherings. * If we do attend them, we may arrive unprepared, fueling embarrassment.  **We may come across easily frustrated because we can't focus.**  * I didn't realize until I started treatment that I become angry when I'm overwhelmed with stimulus. * Inability to filter out noise is just another way of saying inability to focus. * When I can't focus, I get angry, which sends the wrong message to whoever I'm talking to.  **We usually come across as mostly normal, so people don't treat us with the same compassion they would if we had other handicaps.**  * Down's syndrome, Parkinson's, and other handicaps send clear signals to others that often provokes a compassionate response. * People with ADHD, however, appear normal enough, so we don't trigger that same compassion. They assume we should be able to plan, focus, and wait, so when we don't, we incur their judgment. And our own.  **Dealing with ADHD takes time and focus off developing our own identity.**  * Ever hung out with someone who just goes along with what everyone else wants? Who never has an original idea or opinion or interest? Not very fun to be around. That was me. * Healthy relationships take healthy people. Healthy people have developed their sense of preferences, likes, dislikes, hobbies, etc. These become the common bonds that hold people together. * For many reasons, we often don't ever have the time and space to develop these things. We never truly become a person. And it takes people to form relationships. * Developing identity takes time, money, energy, planning, focus, and support — all of which we frequently lack due to ADHD's effect on our whole family system growing up. * For example: If I can learn guitar, I build self-confidence, and a skill that builds bridges into relationships. I can start or join a band, play for family, release stress, and boost my attractiveness to a mate. But learning guitar takes focus, attention, and dedication that ADHD robs me of.  **Not understanding why all this happens, or what to do about it, compounds into shame.**  * When people encounter this kind of behavior, they often don't know what to say or do, other than back off. * This means we lack critical insight into what's causing these suddenly-gone relationships. * This means we feel powerless to improve things. * This means we lose hope, and accept the idea we are broken in some unknown, un-fixable way (another way of saying: shame).  **Shame devastates self-esteem.**  * Self-esteem is the basis for how we treat others. * If I can't trust myself, and nitpick everything I do, I'm going to have a really hard time trusting and not nitpicking others. * If I can't trust and constantly nitpick others, nobody will want to hang out with me. * Without self-esteem I retreat into all kinds of coping behavior that further isolates me:    * I might become hyper-critical of everyone around me as a way of drawing attention off my failures    * I might become codependent, desperate for validation and approval from others    * I might numb out into drug abuse, or other compulsive behavior like overeating, spending, gambling, risky sex, etc.  # So what can we do about it?  This is my approach so far.  1. **Get diagnosed and build a good treatment plan with help from a professional.** Everything depends on this. It will take more time and effort than we all prefer, but nothing happens until this does. 2. **Drown yourself in the facts about ADHD**. This helped stop the shame cycle more than anything for me. You're not broken in some un-fixable way. Your'e not a worthless incompetent loser. You suffer from a neurochemical imbalance that has decades of research and scientific backing. I found audiobooks therapeutic. Ned Hallowell's books gave me encouragement early on. 3. **Work on showing yourself kindness every day.** Maybe that's too much at first—start by trying not to actively berate yourself. Point out whatever you see yourself doing well, and make a big deal about it. End your day with journaling or private reflection on the day's successes. Think small: I didn't overreact to that stressful situation as bad as I did last time. I didn't procrastinate paying my bills quite as long this month compared to last month. I spent 3 hours mindlessly online instead of 5. I made that one phone call I needed to. 4. **Surround yourself with supportive people**. Find a therapist, friend, pastor, CHADD group, or online community that understands your struggle and offers encouragement. Sometimes borrowed self-esteem is what we need until we can fuel self-esteem on our own. 5. **In safe relationships, let them know what's going on.** For the people who would understand, you can tell them something like "hey, I want you to know my ADHD sometimes sends the wrong messages. If I come across as uninterested, distant, or angry, will you let me know?" 6. **Celebrate victories.** So you remembered your nephew's birthday in time to get him a present? Get yourself a present too! Call your support circle and celebrate with them. It's a big deal, even though it may seem laughably small. It's not. 7. **Write letters or emails**. This slows down the social interaction to a pace that we can work better at. It's not a total substitute for face-to-face connections, but it can help smooth things over and keep the relationship on an even keel.  &#x200B;  Wishing you all the very best!  \-Austin  &#x200B;  **P.S.:** I hereby release this post into the public domain worldwide.

Your quality of life will increase 10x when you learn to accept uncertainty and the “grey areas” that are inevitable in life.;;;(Note: I actually just posted this in response to a relevant vent that someone posted. But it took me a lot of tears, panic attacks, and time to learn this so I wanted to share for anyone who needs to hear it in hopes that it could help them.)   When I was starting college, (I’m 27. Been done with undergrad for 6 years now. [ugh, gross.]) I absolutely obsessed over what my major was going to be. I felt as though I HAD to pick something that I was 100% going to want to do for the rest of my life, otherwise I will have wasted my time getting a degree and be destined for a dull life of mediocrity, which was unacceptable to me. I would literally research it constantly in order to reassure myself that whatever the chosen major of the month was was in-fact my absolute destiny. I’d take Meyers Briggs tests online (multiple ones, I had to make sure they were accurate) and look up what jobs fit best. I’d research potential salaries, how to climb the ladder in each field, what courses were needed to get a degree in each field, (and wrestle with whether or not I thought I could pass them) post on industry-related forums, etc. No forum response, no quiz result, and no article was ever good enough to make me feel 100% comfortable with a choice, because guess what? THAT PERFECT ANSWER DOESN’T EXIST.  When I was first officially diagnosed with ADHD, one of the common presentations that my psychiatrist pointed out to me was that a lot of people with ADHD get severe anxiety over making permanent (or at least long-lasting; few things in life are truly permanent) decisions. This comes from knowing that we tend to have a high predisposition to changing our minds often, and locking ourselves into long-term situations makes us DESPERATE to ensure we won’t regret it.  This blew my mind because I’ve always been this way. When my relationship first started with my boyfriend (now husband) I knew it was more than likely that I was going to marry him. I obsessed over whether or not he was my absolute perfect soulmate to the point of panic attacks. I was terrified to break his heart, and terrified to be without him because of my impulsivity and proclivity to change my mind. I’d obsess over whether or not I was getting the perfect apartment, the perfect car, the perfect job, the perfect ANYTHING. I always felt incapable of controlling my short attention span and impulsivities, and I was terrified of meeting the consequence of that: regret.   One of the hardest lessons that I’ve ever had to learn in life is how to be okay with uncertainty, and “grey area.” Nothing in life is absolute. You may regret things, but that’s OKAY. I ended up choosing communications/advertising as my major. I work in advertising now and is it a perfect career? No. But overall I enjoy it and I’m mostly pretty damn good at it. I ended up marrying that boyfriend. I love him more than anything, and our marriage is pretty damn great. Is he ABSOLUTELY perfect for me? No, but no one is.  Overall, just breath, and know that you will be okay. Nothing is ever as bad as we think it will be when we’re mentally catastrophizing it, and imagining a horrible result before we’ve even TRIED something.

These little pills help me accomplish the small things that make me feel alive and happy.  Edit: THANK YOU SO much for all of the replies! The support in this community is so heartwarming and I am so thankful to have found this subreddit. I have tried to reply to everyone and will continue to do so!! To answer some questions:  - I currently take 20mg of Vyvanse but will have to increase and most likely get a booster  - I also take 30 mg Lexapro and 7.5mg Remeron - I live in Canada  - I am 20 F  - I just got diagnosed a week ago  Edit 2: Okay so, I just want to clarify that not everyone experiences ADHD the same way. I am still learning this as I often find myself second guessing my diagnosis if I don't relate to absolutely everyone. We are all different, and experiance the world differently and our ADHD differently. Some may struggle with hygine upkeep, while others may have no problems. This may or may not correlate with other mental health issues that come along with ADHD, but forgetting to brush your teeth and keep up with hygine is at least slightly caused by ADHD in my case. Others with only depression may experience the same thing, but for different reasons. Stay humble and support others for their progress, don't shut them down. Thanks !  Edit 3: TLDR: Vyvanse makes me happy and productive at times but makes me feel very nauseous and causes mood swings.  A bit off topic BUT, I have now been sent home from work due to feeling sick for the 3rd time starting Vyvanse. It is also cauing really intense moodswings by the time it starts to ware off (I take at 7am and stops working by 2pm). Is this possibly because of the other pills I'm taking? Or is it the vyvanse? I love how happy, productive and excited it can make me feel but I can't be leaving work all the time from nausea...  its so uncomfortable and then makes me anxiety even worse. Anyone esle have a similar experience?

Cant believe my luck.;;;Hey guys  Ive been noticing a slight pessimistic tone on this sub today. When I feel like the most miserable chaotic failure of a person ever to have lived, I remind myself of a few important facts.  “Modern” Homo sapiens, that is, people who are roughly like we are today, have been around for at least 50.000 years. Since then, more than 108 billion members of our species have existed on the planet.  If ADHD has been affecting people on a similar level as today, that means around 4.3 - 6.5 billion individuals have struggled through life on this planet with the disorder. These are whole lifetimes of shame, confusion, and general crap taking from the world at large, without any understanding, treatment or help available.  in that context, we are so incredibly fortunate to be alive during this tiny snippet of time, just around 30 years,  where the condition has been scrutinized and finally understood by science, and (for the most part) accepted as a real thing by mainstream society. We now have the most amazing medication and information available to us, ncluding this amazing community here on reddit.  Thanks Universe, Steven Hawking, God or whoever put me here at this exact time and place in the human timeline.  &#x200B;  edit:      This post really made for some great discussions! Glad I managed to cheer some of you up. (and piss some off) But all is well that stirs well. Thanks all who contributed!       Its important to note that I went through 30 years of life undiagnosed. During that time my baseline was on a different planet. It was a rough, debilitating mental state that I never want to return to.  During that time I had to literally force-feed myself with positive sentiments like this just to stay afloat. ADHD affects us all differently, and we all have different strategies to manage it, and  this sub is the perfect place to share our thoughts on that.      &#x200B;

After failing (often) I realized that the most effective strategy for me was not to overpower my brain, but to trick it. Thought I’d share my little manifesto here in case it’s helpful for anyone else.   **The Trickster:**  This is not a fight, it is a card game. You are not a warrior, you are a swindler and a trickster. You are here for one reason: **to win the hand**. Sometimes the cards you’re dealt can’t win the hand. You really want to fold. But you don’t have to. Because you have your tricks. And remember – you have **never lost the hand** when you pull off one of your tricks.   **Kyle’s bag of tricks:**  **The Juggle:** Ok Brain, I see you there, trying to procrastinate doing the dishes. Forget about the dishes for now, I have a game for you. It’s a really interesting multi-tasking problem for you to solve: How do I most efficiently do the laundry, pick up the house, make breakfast *and* do the dishes? What’s the optimal order? Which of those things can be ‘going’ while I work on the other?   **The Trump Card:** Oh hi there, Brain – I see you’re gearing up to avoid setting up this doctor appointment. Is that right? Well why don’t we just work on filing our taxes two months in advance instead. Oh man you *really* don’t want to do the taxes huh? I’m feeling a strong distraction pulse from you, Brain. Maybe we don’t do the taxes right now, maybe we just distract ourselves from them. You know what is a good distraction by comparison? Setting up this doctor appointment. Come on, let's avoid those taxes together.   **The Bait and Switch:** Brain, you are getting really worked up. Loads of impulse seeking. Look, let’s just go online and play this game. Just for 5 minutes, ok? You win.                                         [5 minutes pass]  Wait a second, this isn’t a game at all is it? It’s actually that term paper we needed to work on. Surprise! You couldn’t even tell the difference. You just wanted to win, and you forgot to pay attention after that.   **Call the Clock:** Look Brain, you’ve taken too long avoiding this email. I know you don’t want to do it, but I’m going to give you 15 minutes to decide. I’m setting a timer for 15 minutes. At the end, if you want to bail on it, we can bail on it. I promise. In the meantime, I’m just going to start writing it, but I will absolutely stop if you want to when the timer goes off. We can go play video games.   Edit: Thanks for the feedback guys, it really means a lot. We all have unique perspectives and successes to share, so I'll commit to posting more often here!

My roommate even gets upset because he will send me memes and i, somehow, have gotten so inattentive that I block the notification entirely. I have Facebook messages sitting in my inbox from good friends just asking how I’m doing. They’ve been there over a week. It gives me so much guilt because i don’t understand why it’s so challenging for me to just... start a conversation? Does anyone else have this issue?  It feels like the gears of my brain are permanently stuck and I can move neither forward or backward. I just stare at the wall all day.

It is characterized by pervasive, long-term (typically 3+ months) exhaustion, loss of function, and reduced tolerance to stimulus";;;This study surfaced on /r/science: https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/gyb96a/study_autistic_burnout_is_a_syndrome/  I'm crossposting it here, because the mechanism described  ("resulting from chronic life stress and a mismatch of expectations and abilities without adequate supports. It is characterized by pervasive, long-term (typically 3+ months) exhaustion, loss of function, and reduced tolerance to stimulus") seems very relevant for ADHD-induced burnout/depression as well.  At the same time I'd like to point out this passage from the top comment (from supposedly a psychiatrist): "Burnout doesn’t just happen with autism, although autistic burnout has specific symptoms that differentiate it from other types of burnout, which will tend to have their own other specific symptoms. Burnout can happen with any chronic condition that impacts a person’s function and life satisfaction. In mental health, we see burnout with autism, ADHD, depression, anxiety, OCD, most every chronic condition that we treat. **Again, autistic burnout will be different from ADHD burnout**, but many conditions can cause burnout."  So bear in mind that this study is about autistic burnout, and that it differs in details from ADHD-burnout according to a specialist, even though its *short* description seems very relevant and applicable.

I may not answer to yall, but please let it be known that Ive read every single response Ive got. I just wanna say that, is thanks to communities like this one that I got the courage to insist on what was wrong with me... all of u are wonderful people n I can only wish u happiness n luck on ur personal journey with ADHD 🎉✨ .   .   so! for a bit of context: Im a 23 y/o who was been dealing with alot of the symptoms of ADHD my whole life, investigated n researched about it... but no matter with who I talked to, no one would believe me; in fact, most people categorized me as "smart, but lazy and distracted" to the point I started to believe it (and as byproduct, developed depression at the sweet age of 13)  it wasnt until I was 19 that my psychologist at that time noticed something was different with me, and told me that I probably suffered from ADHD. the problem was that, before she could confirm anything, I stopped going since my dad thought I was already better and, me being me, didnt think much of it.  now, 23, going to college and having dealt with a lot of problems regarding procrastination, lack of focus, overstimulation and many more things; starting to believe that the problem was me being a failure and never living to the expectations of everyone around me... I can finally be at peace that it wasnt me, I just didnt have the right diagnosis. I can finally start to make a positive change in my life!    tl;dr: after years of dealing with ADHD and people not believing me, I finally got the right diagnosis

Topics could include hyperfixation (both good and bad), emotional disregulation, ADHD comorbidities, how ADHD affects relationships...  If we, as a community, could make easy-to-share images for Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, it could be a really cool community project!

They're taking this medication that we are prescribed so that we can live our lives and use it as mental steroids.   Every time this makes the news, it always feels like it gives people with adhd who have to medicate a bad name by proxy. Never mind that this stuff probably literally saved my life in high school, I'm just another AP junkie with a pill bottle in my hand.  EDIT: I did not know this would get so huge. I've been seeing a lot of great discussion on this thread, but I'd also like to  1) remind people to be civil (already had to report someone) and 2) ask what people mean by "gatekeeping," because I'm seeing that comment a lot and have no idea what it means.

Came back and got 100 on the first exam where the class exam median was 52.;;;Undiagnosed adhd my first go at college and while also dealing with severe depression.   Got diagnosed, worked on my mental health, and decided to give college a go again.   Came back this semester working my butt off, going through the long process of getting accommodations, and studying everyday.   Professor tells class that we did the worst in his several years of teaching. I’m nervous and in a bad mood waiting for the grade to be posted.   See 100 on blackboard. Must be a mistake. Go talk to professor. NOPE.   Anyone struggling with school, life, and work. YOU GOT THIS. DONT GIVE UP.   Edit: You guys are amazing. I posted this because I wanted to tell any single person about how my hard work has finally started to produce results. I did not expect such a positive response. The happiness I have felt from your encouraging words, advice, questions, and almost family-like interaction you guys have provided is unmeasurable.   For those of you who are succeeding, keep at it!! Don’t slow down.   For those of you who are struggling, we all have our ups and downs. It’s what you do with it that matters. Fight and never give up! Keep your chin up, we are all rooting for you :)  Edit 2: The amount of love I have for you guys...  Those who have fought and are succeeding have shared stories that I aspire to one day make my own. You provide the crucial evidence that I desperately need to know that this progress can continue and maybe even improve.   Those who are beginning the fight/in the midst of it... you are an inspiration. You are the hope that so many individuals need. You are what keeps me going. My love for you and your ambitions to take on this difficult journey with a determination so fierce brings me to tears.

"Oh, we recognize your brain has a chronic shortage of dopamine  and nothing can ever cure it. We also recognize that dopamine is the motivation chemical and that if you dont have enough of it you are truly unable to do lots of things."  "But just because something is impossible doesn't mean you get a pass on doing it!"  Am I just interpreting this wrong? There are days where I truly cannot do something no matter what happens. All the good habits and McGyvering in the world arent enough sometimes.   Does anyone with ADHD really just shit on everyone and use it as an excuse? If people are on a subreddit for support for this kind of thing, why do people feel like saying that helps anything?   It seems like theres a large emphasis on this kind of messaging and it always feels minimizing. Why? People with ADHD can be happy, successful, and brilliant, but for some or all of us, it really is excruciating. Just because we can put ourselves through 50x the stress to do something doesnt mean its then a choice. People have emotional limits, even if they can force themselves to do something physically, that doesn't mean it wont break them mentally. Its like someone who has a lame leg. They could run a short distance somewhat fast, but they'll snap fragile ligaments and be worse off then.   Why does it always feel like ADHD is a broken leg and everyone always says, "I understand your pain, I really do, but thats zero excuse not to still function like it isn't broken!"  Disability is a spectrum. Some people here have less/more impairment than others.  Its great if you feel like you can put the whole, "its not an excuse" on yourself, if thats how it is for you, but its really silly to be commenting on peoples' posts who are here for support.   I try so much harder than anyone I know, yet sometimes I still come up short. Thats because I have a disability. Thats the definition of an excuse.  Edit: I do want to say that this was more of a rant/critique rhetoric within not just our community, but so many others. There are certain things that don't need to be said. Much like the above. If someone is going to use ADHD as an excuse to abuse or neglect people, they certainly aren't going to change their ways due to someone saying, "Oh, make sure you know it's not an excuse."  Make sure to call out bad behavior when you see it, not make imprecise pre-emptive statements prescribing a lack of understanding on the subject of your idea. It's just not helpful and comes across as minimizing sometimes. Even if your intentions were stellar, maybe it's just not that useful of a statement.

Looking from their side it may look like I am angry without a cause.  Let’s imagine the same situation, from two different perspectives:  My girlfriend is entering the room and she sees me siting in front of my computer. browsing my phone with one hand, and pen-spinning with the other hand. She starts asking question:  &#x200B;  **My GF:** Hey honey, can you please…….  **Me:** FOR CHRIST’S SAKE! NOT NOW! I AM TRYING TO WORK HERE!  **My GF:** What is wrong with you?!?!  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  And yeah, from her perspective it may be seen as a blast of anger for no reason. But looking on what is happening inside my head is making this a bit different…  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  ***Brain***: Hey whatcha doin'?  **Me:** I am trying to work.  ***Brain:*** *Booooooooooring!*  ***Brain:*** *Check you phone.*  **Me:** What?  ***Brain***: Check you phone. Now.  **Me:** Why? I am really trying to work here..  ***Brain:*** *We’re low on dopamine, check your phone.*  **Me:** I am working!  ***Brain:*** *CHECK YOUR PHONE! How can you know if there isn’t something interesting? We are low on dopamine, remember? Every stimulus counts in this type of situation!*  **Me:** …  ***Brain:*** *What kind of strings are used in banjos?*  **Me:** What??  ***Brain:*** *Is it the same type as in guitars?*  ***Brain:*** *Or different?*  ***Brain:*** *We should check it now.*  ***Brain:*** *Go on, google it.*  **Me:** I am really trying to work! Not now!  ***Brain:*** *Heeeeeey, you know what? We should learn how to play banjo! Google how much does it cost to buy a banjo.*  **Me:** I will not spend any more money on a next hobby, that I will abandon in 10 minutes.  ***Brain:*** *We won’t abandon it. We will become world-famous bluegrass musician. I am sure.*  **Me:** Nope.  **Me:** And be silent now, I am trying to focus.  ***Brain:*** *♬ huummmmhummmhummmmmmmhmmmhmmmmhuuuuhmmmm ♫*  **Me:** Shut up.  ***Brain:*** *♬ WEEEEST VIRGINIAAAAAAAAAAA! ♬*  ***Brain:*** *♬ MOUTAIN MAMAAAAAA! ♬*  **Me:**  Shut up!!!  ***Brain:*** *♬ TAKE MEE ♬*  ***Brain:*** *♬ HOMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!! ♬*  **Me**: WILL YOU BE QUIET FOR FIVE MINUTES?  ***Brain:*** *Nope, I’m bored.*  ***Brain:*** *Stop doing this boring stuff!*  ***Brain:*** *We can do it later!*  **Me:** Yeeeeeeeah sure, but when?  ***Brain:*** *LATER!*  ***Brain:*** *I’ve literally just said it!*  ***Brain:*** *Jeeez, man… are you even listening to me?*  ***Brain:*** *What’s wrong with you?*  ***Brain:*** *You need to focus man!*  **Me:** SHUT UP!  ***Brain:*** *DON’T TELL ME WHAT TO DO!*  ***Brain:*** *I AM THE ONE IN CHARGE HERE!*  ***Brain:*** *YOU WILL NOW ABORT WHATEVER TASK YOU ARE DOING AND YOU WILL GO FOR A QUEST OF FINDING QUICK DOPAMINE SOURCES!*  **Me:** SHUT UP!!!!!

EDIT:  **I am finding it hilarious that actually many of you went google how old John Denver was when he learned how to play guitar :D**     And also just to clarify - yes, I know the only person here to blame is myself. Not my girlfriend, not the ADHD itself. But understanding ADHD after being diagnosed finally  allowed me to work on my behaviour in a proper way
904edf56fb8a9058cf4f088ed4e9c9aa1d732924260cdca2018e939e67990c6c;;;I finished my Master's degree!;;;I just want to tell everyone that I did it. I finished defending my Master's thesis. I have completed all the requirements for my Master's degree. I was diagnosed with ADHD as an adult and started my college adventure without medication. I maintained a 4.0 throughout my undergrad even without meds for the first half. However, once I started taking meds, it made everything so ... right. I guess that's the best way to describe it. I didn't have to spend as much time reading and re-reading my textbooks and I didn't go all over the place with my papers just to have to go back and correct them multiple times. After my undergrad degrees (I completed an associate's and three Bachelor's degrees) I went for my Master's and now I'm done. I'm so happy for myself.  I guess since I can't celebrate in the real world I came here to celebrate.  Edit: Some have expressed doubt that I have three Bachelor's degrees, so here is a picture. https://imgur.com/WSR3ZxB
dc937b59892604f5a86ac96936cd7ff09e25f18ae6b758e8014a24c7fa039e91;;;Some days, I honestly feel like I'm too sensitive for this world.;;;I don't really know a better way to put it, but it's a strange feeling. I have a good life here in the U.S. and live with my parents, just got diagnosed around a year ago (Meds have helped me immensely).  I don't know if this even an ADHD thing, but I've always been so damn sensitive about pretty much everything (criticism makes me feel worthless, I always have a nagging feeling that people are holding on to my mistakes and to every breakdown I've had, and think of me as a dumb emotional child, and see me as a very weak 23 year old man)  To compound onto the constant overload in my head about myself, I also have too much empathy (and I don't know if this is because I'm too emotional or everyone else is numbed out) but I feel great dread for others, and want to help everyone I meet (I've volunteered a lot in the past before this extreme depression took over) Even when I was volunteering I always thought that it was never enough to change things on a bigger scale and that made me even more upset. One thing I suspect is that I've never really dealt with hardship at all, I've always been well taken care of since I was born, and I've heard that sometimes you need to be homeless or hurt by someone to turn your empathy levels down (and I definitely don't want that.)  I feel helpless to changing anything and it makes me feel like life is really pointless sometimes, I don't think I could handle ending up at a dead end job just making enough to get by, living in some trashy apartment. I fear my country is diving head first into some kind of Orwellian dystopia and that concerns me greatly. All I want is to live somewhere where it doesn't feel wrong to care about others. I don't want to feel so broken anymore for showing emotion and then be berated for it by everyone I know. I'm far from perfect and yes I realize that I had it made growing up, but that doesn't discount my emotions. I'm allowed to feel, dammit.  I don't know what this rant is but I just feel such a whirlwind of emotions all the time and it's so fucking exhausting.  Edit: My goodness, this community is so amazing. I've never felt more comfortable in my own skin while reading these comments. Thank you all, from the bottom of my heart!
9c57297e943f8dbff45dfaa9ab43539a54fcecca77709bd57e19d7cb415a9af3;;;Graduated from medical school and got a job!;;;**til;dr: struggled with ADHD all throughout school, somehow got into medical school but almost failed out. Didn’t want to be a doctor and contemplated suicide. Was able to push through, graduate, and land a job outside of clinical medicine, more in line with my passion/preferences.**  I’ve never shared this with anyone.   I’m new to this community, but after a long period of suffering, have rediscovered that managing my ADHD is a worthwhile investment.   I was diagnosed in childhood and again as an adult. In childhood, always observed as bright but also always getting into trouble. I was a mediocre student throughout grade school, always “not living up to my potential.” In high school, I did okay but only really began to apply myself when discovering a love for chemistry. Barely getting into college, I was top of my class at a mid/lower tier university, and somehow was able to self motive towards the goal of getting into medical school. (I also loved my major, chemistry, and was good at it.)  My hard work payed off and got me into a top 3 US medical school.   That’s when everything came crashing down...  Once the star student, I was now in the big leagues. Furthermore, I came to realize I never actually was that interested in being a doctor. I guess I just saw it was cool and science related, but little did I know I actually hated being in the hospital. I failed my first medical school exam in anatomy. I barely passed each subsequent class, often just getting by the minimum of 70% no matter how hard I tried to study. In my second year, I failed my boards exam, which set me back an entire year. I had to take on more debt. I became depressed. I had to go to a specialized program for 8 weeks to help me pass my boards. When I returned to medical school in my third year (the hardest year) I became so disillusioned that I contemplated killing myself. I couldn’t get myself to care when I halted the environment and future prospects.   I decided I didn’t want to become a doctor for the rest of my life, but needed to finish my degree. I began thinking about alternative careers like consulting or healthcare startups. I ended getting interviews from great consulting firms, only to get rejected my all of them. On my last limb, I became depressed again but continued to interview. Sometimes I thought I was literally going to go work for McDonalds since I didn’t apply to residency like the rest of my classmates, and no one wanted to hire me. After a year of interviewing I was able to finally land a life sciences consulting job (only 1 offer!).  I graduated, stopped being depressed after finally having some light at the end of the tunnel.  I’m now two weeks into my new job and loving it. It’s hard, especially given how much prioritization and task management is required in consulting. But it’s an intense environment where things are often due next-day or in a few hours, which I find helps motivate me.   I still struggle with ADHD daily, but now with a job I can finally afford to get professional help.

12a51093225a80e8d26139d9e5b798b7e610ee7b92142c7e34e770bc0593b0dd;;;40 minutes after first dose of Adderall and I sobbed;;;I was recently diagnosed with ADD/ADHD as a 27-yo female. I've experienced symptoms for my entire life, but always wrote them off as consequences of my weird, frenetic personality/ a lack of discipline. I'm pretty high-functioning and managed to build fail-safe systems all around me to reduce or contain my own failures. Happy to discuss that more if it'd help anyone.  I recently saw a doctor for chronic fatigue. I guessed it could be due to underlying anxiety, and shared that I couldn't focus at work/ follow what people are saying when their mouths are moving/ approach long-game tasks, etc. She surprised my by asking if I might have ADD/ADHD. Desperate to feel less exhausted, I told her I was willing to test any new solutions she came up with. She prescribed 5 mg/day of Adderall to start. I knew it was a stimulant and was so afraid it'd make me feel even more overwhelmed, as coffee often does.  40 minutes in to my first dose, and I felt. so. at peace. I didn't feel wired or energized; I almost felt sleepy. But alert-enough and content. There was no magical superpower propelling me through my work, but I proceeded with a calm confidence that everything would be okay. I reflected on this, and how different that new feeling was from the exhaustion I've known for forever, and was overcome by tears.  I know medication isn't for everyone, but this experience told me the following: it's not your fault. You're doing your best. It will get better. You're not alone.  I posted from a throwaway account, but I wanted to thank everyone who contributes on this forum, which supported me in the past few months as I made the decision to try medication. You are generous people making a difference in the lives of strangers you've never met <3  EDIT: Some important points were raised in the comments re: dangers of medicating. There are numerous short-term and (perhaps even scarier) long-term side effects to consider. I think addictive personalities with unconfirmed AD(H)D diagnoses should especially beware. Anyone interested in medicating should do so in consultation with a medical professional. Not an anonymous redditor. And that includes me! This post reflects my experience only, which could be very different from yours. Thanks to everyone who weighed in.
b855c25e8909f333c6fa2a22e3d6fceb599fb2d7930eda5fc0b95f246b8d4a03;;;Dating a girl with ADHD-C, an outsider's perspective;;;I have anxiety and depression but I'm coping well with treatment and a lotttt of therapy. I always thought I had it tough. I was even a little dismissive of how much ADHD can affect people because they were painted as geniuses and bright and adorkable etc...  I have a degree in Psychology and I'm still in university still working on becoming a psychiatrist, I've had a nearly three year long paid internship at two different clinics.   But dating someone with ADHD has not met my expectations!! It's made me confront a lot of the biases from my lecturers, from books, from studies I've read, from clients I've met. There's a lot of variables and "flavours" and I'm sorry I'm talking about it in such an attached way but I visit this subreddit a lot and it's great to see there are also huge, huge things you all can relate on.   This is completely anecdotal and specific to her, how her ADHD manifested and made her who she is. But I just wanted to share because it's opened my mind up in ways reading and discussing about in class never would have and I think they're more universal symptoms than I'm giving them credit for.   It's insane to me that her disorder has played such a huge role in her daily life + overall life and was completely overlooked until she went through a gruelling process (in this country) to seek the help she needed...   * She has a tic disorder.   She's ADHD Inattentive and Hyperactive. But this one is insane to me. She scrunches her nose, cracks her knuckles, stretches her arms out and blinks abruptly. This started without medication but medication makes it much worse.  Watching Rupaul Drag race means tongue popping is her new thing she can't stop doing. I'm not easily annoyed by this but I noticed her mouth tastes different because she's been doing it so much, I'm guessing she's bruised the inside of her mouth lol. She hasn't noticed she does it when she's walking down the street.    Tourettes, ADHD, and OCD have similar origins neurologically. I'm still trying to figure this one out.   * The anger.   If you corner her, which I've seen people in her life do, she will lash out with a barrage of emotions you'd never think she had because she's so chill and easygoing. This baffles the people in her life. I know to let her cool off, she can get in such a funk about a particular situation and not be able to let go and gets completely overwhelmed with emotion. But it doesn't last long if you just let her work it out and give her space.   * She lets people take advantage of her kindness.   Her rejection dysphoria makes her unsure of herself and constantly look for approval. She's loyal to a fault. This, I never realised, could be ADHD related because her natural personality is to rebel and question authority...until it's someone she loves...then she lets them completely cross her boundaries.   It seems she's has cardinal rules she'll never break, that's part of her inherent character, not part of her ADHD. But when it comes to herself, because of ADHD, she constantly lets other people walk all over her. Her self-esteem is up in the air thanks to being terrified of rejection.   Her natural personality, if she was a neurotypical, let's say, would be to tell someone to fuck off and be extremely, helpfully honest. So I hate that she has so many self doubts.   This is why self-esteem isn't thinking just thinking "I'm the shit," and being over confident. It's so important, guys. And I recommend everyone learn what their boundaries are and how to speak up if someone is mistreating you! So, so, so important to your mental health. I've seen her go from a fiery woman to distressed and overly sympathetic to people who don't deserve it way too many times and it fucks me off. It fucks me the fuck off so fucking badly. She shouldn't feel guilty for being herself.   * She gets phrases/words stuck in her head (intrusive thoughts).   With me, she allows these random words to leave her lips. Lately she's been saying "[oovoo javer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cW-QwnzdI0)." I always thought this was just a funny quirk of hers.   I knew there was overlap with OCD and ADHD, which is why her tic was fascinating to me, but this explains so much about how she'll randomly come out and say the weirdest shit.   "[Yer faether wid be proud﻿](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LW7Iv-V1-Jo)" is another one. It's honestly hilarious to me, I just never realised it was routed in ADHD...And I didn't know it could get darker, she told me she has persistent, intrusive thoughts about things she hates like spiders crawling on her and falling down stairs. A razor blade sliding down her heart has been one she's had her whole life.   I know everyone experiences the call of the void and that's normal. But intrusive thoughts?? That can mess with your psyche and and be an annoyance for you at the least.   * Avoidance.   When she's overwhelmed, she just avoids things. She won't make that call, she won't do the paperwork, she won't do the grocery shopping. It can be the simplest things, if she's overwhelmed, she avoids it. She's a pretty and charming girl so she often gets away with it and it never bites her in the ass. I'm not sure how much this applies to other people, but I KNOW she's stressing about things that could be easily be solved.   I used to get frustrated with her, but now I see if you keep adding things to her "list", she gets overwhelmed easily. I can't relate to this because I have an ordinary reward response to getting things ticked off a list. This is an executive functioning problem. She WANTS to get through the day and get everything done, but there's a lack of dopamine, a lack of "normal" stimulation to do something.   It can all be a bit much. It's not that she doesn't want to do something, but she'll often find herself distracting herself, not because she's so flighty and oh so random and spacey, no, because doing things doesn't give her the same "thrill" it does neurotypicals and this constant battle of expectations and responsibilities makes her shirk away and feel preemptively inadequate if she gets it wrong.   I'd like to thank her teachers and parents for constantly shouting at her for this one 🙃  * She's easily hurt.   Again, rejection dysphoria. She'll make fun of herself all the time, but sometimes you can say something and not realise you've hurt her feelings. I've always been guilty of thinking I'M the sensitive one so I've gotten defensive how I could possibly hurt her feelings. Don't do this. Because I realised over the years, she never steps on my toes. She's ultra sensitive to other people's feelings and extremely empathetic.   Your feelings are valid, guys. You need to tell people if they've hurt your feelings and if they're good to you, they'll understand. I know it's not that simple, but you once you respect your own feelings you should expect other people to as well.   * Sensory problems.   She gets extremely overwhelmed by her senses. If she's driving in the car, you need to be quiet. She won't even play music. As an example, one time an advert played on youtube when we were playing a video in the car and it was so loud and intrusive that she had to pull into a parking spot and gather her thoughts and nearly hit another car while she did.   Even crossing the road she can misread one little thing and nearly be hit by a car. There's a LOT happening on the road all the time, people say those with ADHD are amazing in a crisis and that may be true. But all that information can definitely impair someone with ADHD.   She seems to always be a step behind everyone else and honestly, it's one of the most debilitating symptoms I've noticed. People get really frustrated with her, I'm like "dude, she has ADHD. Slow the fuck down."   It's no joke.   * She cannot take direction.   This is what baffles me about her being overlooked with having a mental disorder her whole life.   If you verbally list off something for her to do, she just won't get it right and panics herself. She needs to figure it out. I noticed this when she was playing games, she can't do tutorials. She can't press the right buttons at the right times, she doesn't understand what the fuck the game is asking her to do haha.  It's funny watching her play games and get things wrong so many times before she gets it right. We got ff15 recently and she's gotten so frustrated with what missions are asking of her and if it wasn't for our friend, she would've gave up the game days ago.   She was a very talented athlete when we were kids, super fast, amazing reflexes, galant and skilled, but never went for the obvious kill and completely tuned out her coaches. Me and our friends would be in balls of laughter as her coach would be red in the face. Especially basketball, "lay up! Lay up! oH MY GOD LAY UP!!"   * She has an innate interest in people.  She likes to get to the meat of things. She's actually really good at small talk, just because she likes learning about people and what makes them tick.   I never considered this an ADHD thing until I figured out this is what stimulates her. Getting to the core of things, finding out what makes people different. She'll quiz you on silly things and push your buttons, but she'll also find out what things you have in common.   Conversation with her...she can't stay on topic. It's so much fun if you roll with it. She always wants to hit a nerve, hit a bone, uncover truths. It's not the mechanics of monotonous conversation, it's the fact she is genuinely stimulated by the inner workings of things beyond the details, the everyday. Or tying the everyday into something more interesting and revealing about humanity. She'll come away from the most banal conversation with a new understanding of someone I never would've considered. And she can have the most boring conversations with people and glean something from it.   She turned her mental disorder here into a great strength. I really admire her emotional intelligence. I often hear people with ADHD saying they have trouble listening, but she loves listening! She'll remember every word of conversation. I'm guessing this also ties into the rejection dysphoria and needing to please people so eventually listening and understanding became a huge part of her.   * She can't sit down and watch a movie.    She wants to make them, because it's such a meaty thing with so much to figure out and play with. Tying into my last point.  But it seems watching films is too much of an emotional investment for her. She can watch TV because there's more time to get emotionally invested in characters and formulas etc. but films? I can't think of the last time we watched a film together and she didn't fall asleep.   * SHE CAN'T JUST DO ONE THING.  This I find really amusing. If she's playing video games, she plays youtube videos or watches a TV show at the same time.   When she's cleaning or doing dishes or walking, she has to be listening to music or have something on in the background. She listens to countless audio books and podcasts when she's walking. When she's eating she has to watch something. There's always something playing on her laptop/TV.   It flies in the face in what I've observed with her needing to concentrate on one thing. It seems she needs so much stimulation at once. But if you call her name/if her phone goes off/whatever then her "fuck I'm overstimulated" thing kicks in.   So, pretty much, again, with ADHD she needs the utmost stimulation because of a lack of dopamine. But because of sensory overload, this has to be something within her control.  **edit:** lmao already downvoted within 3 minutes, there's no way someone read all this without a snap judgement then. If you want to judge it, read it first, *then* downvote if you think it's irrelevant.

6cc1e4f65a21f13d57dca5389308b1d6450c77e2155d6148df6e46885c16c41b;;;Most jobs aren't ADHD friendly, and it's driving me to the edge;;;TL;DR I hate my jobs and they are completely not suited for anyone with ADHD... but I'm stuck in such jobs, and I'm really frustrated.  EDIT: I just wanted to throw in a little edit to thank everyone for the support and for making me feel like I'm not alone in my struggles. It really means a ton to me. You're all wonderful <3  I'm writing this before I leave for yet another horrible night at work, and I guess I just need to rant and vent about just how frustrated I am with just how stuck I am in life, especially when it comes to my work life. I was only diagnosed with ADHD-C about 4 months ago now, but it's been something I always struggled with, especially when it comes to employment. I've always been completely miserable at every job or gig I have held. Every day I've known that I have work later on is just a wall of depression. Lately, it's gotten to the point that I've had thoughts of just running away from it all.  I dread work. I know that even with my medications I will get overwhelmed, I will struggle, I will fall behind, and I will be criticized for it. Every shift is another miserable mood, and I always come home upset. Sometimes I leave with my coworkers upset at me too, because they have to pick up all the slack I leave behind. Every job I have ever been qualified for has stressed me out to the point of panic and dread. Busy night at work? You can be sure I spend some time trying to keep it together and just make it through the end of the night, constantly checking the clock hoping that my shift is almost over. It's miserable.  What's even more frustrating is that almost every job is like this. Every workplace will always want the multitasker, the hard worker, the hyper focused superstars. Ones that can work at a fast pace or under stress. I will never be that candidate. No workplace ever wants people like me, who struggle to ever scrape by the minimum expectations at the workplace. It hurts, it's frustrating, and I am afraid that so long as I am alive, this norm will never change. I'm convinced that I will always be "second class", and I'll never make it far. Every job will continue to overwhelm me, even on my medications, and I'll have to live with this daily cycle of misery and dread. And worst of all, most people don't understand it. My family would always scold me for complaining about a job, and would push me to just "learn to work hard for once".  The worst part is, there really aren't greener pastures to run to for me. I've stuck with the same few mostly part-time jobs and gigs for several years now, and I know that if I do what's right for me and leave even one of them, I'm possibly screwed.  Anyways, sorry for the super long rambling rant. I just sorta poured this frustration out in the hour before I leave for yet another incredibly miserable and long shift at work where I'll certainly fall behind and become overwhelmed, and have to stay super late into the night to finish up what I need to do. I hope you folks are doing well.
e26c57abebe499a37049d5a5cffb6b9598f6f73147e7753d8a87e8daf4cc7164;;;How was I failed so badly? Why did no one help me when it was obvious I was struggling?;;;This is a bit of rant. Apologies in advance. This probs won’t even make sense. When I look back on my whole life and everything I can remember, I just think to my self why didn’t a single care giver or teacher notice any of my symptoms, why was I never given any support and why the heck was I failed so badly. Was left my whole school life undiagnosed. In my opinion it was very obvious, even from such a young age. Why are girls in particular often not noticed. I can only pray that kids in the future do not get failed and actually get support :( I understand the teachers may have just thought I was a badly behaved kid and I didn’t care about school but doesn’t change the fact that I could have had such a different school life.. I’m just mad. I want to dedicate so much of my life to raising awareness for adhd
65c980b17271762b3f6b5081e07619eaa460a2d39bf2deb44ecea08903915d7e;;;"But you're so smart" "But you've made it this far";;;I feel like my ADHD is being discredited because I'm in graduate school. Like...yes I've made it this far without a diagnosis but that doesn't mean I haven't struggled? Yes I've done well in classes and I'm thankful I got good grades in undergrad but I was never able to sit down and study, or pay attention in a classroom. I made it through high school doing my homework for my second class in my first class, or studying for my afternoon test during my morning class. I'm honestly still not sure how I did it. Like..no one likes waking up at 2am the day of a test to learn all of the material, I don't just do that for fun?? I don't turn things in a minute before the deadline with subpar or unfinished work because I live for the adrenaline rush?? And when I got to the point where I wasn't doing well anymore I sought out a diagnosis because every way I've tried to cope was working anymore. But I just feel like everyone in my life is confused why "all of a sudden" I have a problem. I try to bring up to non school pieces like how you could never see the floor of my room as a child because it was so messy, or the impulsive/hyperactive tendencies I had that were just deemed part of my personality but it still seems like people just don't understand.
b414840e911df53b77f0a3ddca82aaa7388f4ce127bcafd7f5be840891404699;;;I hate how insecure and unsure my ADHD has made me.;;;I know this is probably something a lot of us struggle with but it’s still hard. I went for 29 years of my life wondering why I always felt so immature compared to my peers. I felt like any small thing I did or said massively impacted the way people looked at me. I’ve struggled to make friends and I’ve struggled to keep the ones I do have. I have never given myself credit and am always self conscious of how I look, move, talk, and act. I feel like a lot of it stemmed from my undiagnosed ADHD.   I just want you guys to know you are enough. You’re amazing and I get how hard it is. You’re not alone.   Edit/Update:   Guys thank you so much! This got a lot more attention than I thought it would and I tried to respond to as many as I could!   I just want to say to all of you that feel the same way and struggle with RSD that you aren’t alone. You aren’t a screw up and you have a beautiful and sensitive heart. I feel like people with ADHD have the biggest kindest hearts and that’s something to be proud of!   To anyone who is on the fence about seeking help or a diagnosis, please do it! You won’t regret it!   To all the people who got a diagnosis late in life and struggle with the what if’s of their past, I got diagnosed at 29 and made a ton of huge mistakes due to my ADHD brain. I finally sought help after being continually frustrated with my two toddlers and not feeling like I was a good enough parent/ not being able to conform to societies expectations. Now I accept who I am and am trying to learn to love myself again. It’s not to late!   To everyone with ADHD, Don’t hate yourself. It’s okay that others don’t understand, the most important thing is for you to love and understand yourself. Enjoy your journey of self discovery and be patient with yourself. Don’t worry if you can’t keep up with today’s pace, learn your own pace! Plus the world would be so boring without us!   If you need someone to listen please pm me! You’re not alone! Thanks for all the support and advice!   Good vibes, Prayers, Peace Be With You, and Namaste! ❤️☯️☮️   Edit 2: Thanks for the gold and the award kind strangers! Much love!!!!
d12961aa0505a4c31a4dff5351e27c509baeab04577063ba1b9bb8befd4aaa44;;;I took adderall (generic) and now have to wonder- is it normal to just do things? Is this what ive been missing?;;;Tldr: took the pill- and i cleaned up with no internal struggle. I simply think of something or see something that should be done because its important... And i start doing it. Is that really the drug, or is it wishful thinking? Is this how nt's live?   I was perscribed a low dose (10mg) adderall (m amphetamine salt) and took it for the first time today. I didnt get any jitters or heart race increases. I didnt feel like i was a superhuman. I felt normal.  And then at one point while i was working on my computer i had a wire get caught on some piece of clutter. I had a moment of thinking "why do you live like this"- basically just a quick joke to myself-but then i started cleaning. Like my brain realized if you dont want to live like this you dont have to. I didnt feel rushed or compelled-i just kind of wanted to have an organized space like i always want but never have- and was able to simply pull myself off of my computer and just start cleaning.  I know it sounds so simple and easy- like something that i shouldnt even be surprised by- but i never do that. I always have those "ill get to it later- after i do this..." Kind of thoughts. And then i never get to it. Today ive just been... Doing things.  And i dont know. Is this the effect of the drug? Is this how people normally are? Ive seen things out of place around the house and ive just been putting them away. I had a dirty dish in my hand and i washed it. And the other dishes in the sink. I guess im just worried i might be giving myself a placebo effect. Or even if im not, is this just a starting "honeymoon phase"?

It's so annoying, every time i try to do something new or try an online course, for example, i just think about why ''i have no time for this'' and end up watching some stupid youtube video.  Anybody else going through this?

I'm actually gonna graduate!;;;After six (6) years I'm actually gonna get out of this alive with a 2:1 MEng in mechanical engineering! By the skin of my teeth!   There were so many moments when I actually couldn't imagine passing. I got diagnosed in fifth year and started trying meds but tbh I got awful side effects and no real benefits until very recently, along with the pandemic and all kinds of other bullshit ie friends hanging themselves and family bring homophobic, all in all this has been hell and I'm glad it's over and maybe one day I will manage to feel proud of myself WOOOOOOO  how do people survive job hunting help me  Sorry in all seriousness thanks to all you guys on this sub you are my lifeline  edit: oh my gosh thank you so much for the awards! I've never had anything blow up like this before. I'm gonna read every single comment.
3c83478262bb9acbc11e9353414df6c4f8b7904387155f3657905a2b3f8314ec;;;Cleaning my room happens to be one of those rare chores that I actually don't struggle with executive dysfunction from. Just because my mom gave me a list with steps when I was little.;;;I get overwhelmed from any type of work ALL the time. Paper? Too much to process, I don't know where to start, so I don't do it. Study? I don't even know what to look at first. The list can go on.  But there's one rare experience I have where my ADHD actually doesn't get in the way! Cleaning my room! Which is so weird because I hear its one of those overwhelming exhausting tasks for most people here.  But the only reason I am this way, is because when I was about 7, my mom gave me a list of 4 simple things and put it on my wall.  It said "1. Pick up clothes.  2. Put away toys.  3. Make bed  4. Put up books."  And the second I got that list it changed everything.  It was no longer just a messy room, it was a set of 4 small tasks.  I never ever had trouble with my room after that.  I just think this is really funny to look at.  It shows us that some of our most difficult frustrating tasks are only difficult because we're given it in the wrong way. **Think about if the world wasn't designed for neurotypical brains.   If we all were just given the same task, but a little differently in the way we're given it.**  We could do *so* much.  Everyone here has struggled with being given some task that their brain can't process because it simply because it was given the neurotypical way.  Our brains are trying. We're trying *so* hard.  And maybe if we can find our equivalent of a "clean your room" list, or other ways to cope with our different brains, people will see that we do in fact try.  Edit: I've never gotten award before this is cool. Thank you kind stranger. Also speaking of overwhelming, I always read every comment on my post but now... idk what I'm gonna do.

It helped understand myself more, validated myself, and talks about easy strategies to get things done. From a professor at Berkeley.;;;An awesome video to help understand we dont have an attention disorder, we have an executive  functioning disorder. I see so many posts \\about people struggling to receive their medication, and the end of the video he goes into how its the most treatable disorder with medication. Show that to your biased doctors. I know I have had far too many and wasted so much time and energy because of their preconceived notions and stereotypes.  &#x200B;   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_tpB-B8BXk0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tpB-B8BXk0)  Edit: went off this account for a while, never thought I'd get so many likes and comments, and of course reddit gold!

'Stop making excuses and just do your shit. This ADHD thing isn't real and if it is then I also have it and you should stop being lazy'.   That's all I'm greeted with ever.

c8df570f0f4d1ce470e7cd4622c8e60318df712b1a3092ce793da05e9893b478;;;My teacher slipped an extra 10% to my exam's grade;;;Due to the quarantine, today's final exam had to be moved online and the format was changed to a multiple choice test with a very strict 30 min time limit (after that time the test would close automatically and submit itself). The thing is that this subject's teacher is also my academical advisor and he knows about my situation and my ADHD diagnosis (which was kinda recent). I still don't have my accommodations so I do every test and assignment like everyone else.  So a few hours after finishing the test, he uploads the grades and I notice that he added an extra +10% to my grade, to make up for the strict timing of the test. He TOTALLY didn't have to do this because I'm still in the process of asking for accommodations and my grade was more than enough to pass the class, BUT HE DID IT ANYWAYS AND IT WAS A SUCH NICE THING TO DO :'((((
235123d4d2d606608dc44a23eaef75e49adf6c7e1d02e287f3ba6bcd95472a6d;;;Beware of predatory "life coaches" here...;;;There are people who read this subreddit and related other ones looking for the most impaired, dysfunctional people they can find.  They'll then message you privately and show a keen interest in you and your story.  Generally they're a little TOO interested for a total stranger who messaged you out of the blue.  They will spend some time exchanging messages with you, try to form some kind of sympathetic bond with you, then eventually you'll get a message like this:  " yknow if youre looking for a therapist, im not a therapist, but i would  be a “life coach” (ie an unlicensed therapist) if you want for whatever  your copay would normally be. I am actually interested to hear more  about your life and experience and to talk with you about your problems. "  This is a scam.  I recently got contacted by one of these people and found it strange how he was SO interested in my life and my problems, but never seemed to want to talk about any of his own.  In my public posts, I'd made it clear that I am destitute, so I didn't suspect somebody looking to scam me for money at first, thus I continued my correspondence for a while longer until eventually I got the above message.    There are predators out there, and they look for vulnerable people looking for answers to prey upon.  DON'T fall for it!  If you really think you need a "life coach", find somebody reputable.  Don't fall for this kind of trap.

Today i put them on for my last one and was soon told to take them off. For NO reason!!! I tried to make clear there wasnt any issue with it before.  He told me 'Look! Isnt it sooo silent here! Take them off!' I whispered 'Thats not the point!' and took them off.  I could hold down my anger towards his sarcastic remark. Like, dude, i clearly dont wear such a device if i didnt need it. Its not for fun.  I cried for about 10 seconds and then tried sucking it in. Having lost 15 minutes on an already short timespan my brain just started making chaos. I ended up doing the completely wrong assignment for 30 MINUTES!!! I had to pull the rest of it together in 25 minutes because of him being super inconsiderate.  Yea i mean, dont mean to be dramatic, it could be worse. Its just that people dont realise how important it is.  Ironically, the exam was about 12 books we had to read, and because i cant read books without pulling my hair out out of frustration, i hadnt read a single one of them. I studied the summaries and hopefully got out of it fine.  TL;DR Teacher told me to take of my silence headphones for no reason which made me mess up my exam.  Edit: not virtual! real life exam. with some useless germ spray.

My boyfriend (27M) of two years with ADD recently broke up with me (29F), about a month after receiving his diagnosis.  He wants time to find himself. I've read so many posts here about how lost people tend to feel post-diagnosis because you literally need to see your entire life with a new lens. I understand and respect this, and I hope everyday that he is doing well.  In his initial consultation, he reported being happy with the relationship. I'm sure it didn't help that I was overseas for one of the busiest periods of my working life when he was going through his testing. I was absent, inattentive, unable to listen to (or observe) his needs (if that makes sense). I also struggled with my own anxiety and depression which made me even more blind to his struggles. To top it all off, I'm in the process of confirming my own ADD diagnosis.  Of course, it's not just about this. Our issues stacked in years of being together. But I'm beginning to realise how I could have understood some of his past behaviours and some of our past experiences in a different light had I known about his diagnosis earlier. If I sought help earlier, I also could have manifested my love in healthier ways and attended to the needs he struggled to communicate.  Well, I can't go back and I’ve come to accept that. So I guess I'm really just here to share all I've learned, in hopes that if any of you are partners, friends or loved ones to people with ADD, you don't make the same mistakes I did.  There are many behaviours that can sometimes make us think people are purposefully hurtful when they are actually just manifestations of an unexplained emotional struggle that is difficult to articulate. Understand, empathise, be patient, and kind. We are all trying our best.  To caveat, I know that everyone is different so just think of all this advice as tools in your Arsenal. Here are some of mine which hopefully can help some of you:  **1. Indulge them and their current fixations.**  There will be stretches of time, long or short, where they will fixate on an idea, an activity, a show, a game, a book, or a general interest that involves several of the above. They will make impulsive purchases to feed this fixation. They will make tradeoffs that might not make sense to you. Do your best to support them. Equip them with materials, books, articles, videos -- but do not get hurt if they don't go through it! Let them run their own race: cheer from the sidelines if they want to be alone and learn with them if they want company.  Let them inspire you and appreciate how lucky you are to be with someone who could be so passionate.  **2. Know that sometimes, fixations end**  If that passion fades, don’t make them feel bad. Instead, congratulate them for what they have achieved and let them move on to the next whenever they’re ready. You never know if or when they'll pick it up again. Watch the light in their eyes flicker on and off, at unpredictable durations, and appreciate it for what it is. They are explorers, adventurers, learners.  **3. Let them engage you first**  Context switching can be really challenging with ADD. So when they want to focus on work or a hobby, just give them space. If your question about dinner or a funny cat video on Facebook can wait until they are disengaged from their current activity, just hold that thought. Make your own list of “things to share with them later”. Let them focus because that focus is fragile.  Unless they invite you to, don’t interrupt or try to join. No matter how well-intentioned, sometimes, the fun of it is in figuring things out by him/herself. Even more times, the fun is in not having to compete or be observed by anyone because the pressure they apply to themselves is high enough.  **4. Be properly engaged**  When they do engage you, pour your heart and soul into it - almost like they do. Be curious and inquire. Understand what about their work or their hobby makes them happy. It might help them find the words too. You never know what other similar activities you might come up with, and things can naturally flow to that next.  **5. Give them space**  This was my biggest mistake. Whenever he felt emotionally stuck, I tried forcing it out of him, thinking that if he just vents or lets it pour out, we can talk it through. It may work for some, but it usually doesn't work for someone with ADD.  ADD is an executive function disorder. It presents issues in emotional regulation. If you force them to talk about feelings that even they don't fully understand yet, they will take the bait and it will lead you both down a terrible path.  It takes time for them to confront and understand what they are really feeling. They may even have the added frustration of not having the correct words for what they're feeling.  Just give them space, leave them be. Respect that.  **6. Be a little deaf and blind during fights**  If the worst comes and they say something they don't mean, don't take it to heart. If they're in the mood to vent, just listen. They might say things that will hurt you. They might lash out and purposefully say mean things. They may blame you for completely tangential things. Detach a little, and hear the emotion (frustration, anger, disappointment) more than the actual slew of words being hurled at you.  Let them speak, vent, rant. When the fog clears, they will be the first person to explain to you what really happened. And you can gently sift through and tackle what was the issue and what was just said out of anger. Their world is still better with you in it. It's just hard to let the rationality rule in emotional distress.  Basically, make room for their anger. The world doesn’t give them enough space for that.  **7. Help design a life / routine that helps them**  ADD impacts executive functions which is essentially the ability to plan, focus, activate, integrate, prioritize, and modulate effort. Designing a slide to be perfectly aligned is the same as filling it up with content - no matter how close the deadline.  So, if they need things to be organised in order to be at peace, respect those boundaries. If they are disorganised and need help designing a routine in order to fulfil their responsibilities, run through the potential structure with them first. Do this patiently and without judgment.  Some practical suggestions:  * Use sticky notes so they don't forget what they needed to do once they switch rooms. * Have a blackboard by the door to remind them of things before they leave the house. * Use a shared calendar so they don't forget important appointments. * Ask them if they'd like you to drop them a text to check on their progress (sometimes this stresses them out instead).  And if they do forget things? Let them know it’s okay. Because hey, we do it with or without ADD too.  **8. Remind them just how amazing they are - just as they are.**  I took this off a comment on one of the reddit threads from u/umklopp because I really can't say it any better:  "Imagine always doing your best, only to constantly hear that not only is your best not good enough, you aren't even really trying. Now further imagine hearing that from basically the very beginning of your life, starting at such an early age that you don't know how to tell the difference between what it feels like to try hard and what it feels like to half-ass something. Basically being scolded for failing to do the impossible your entire life and everyone around your tiny child self informing you that you are choosing to be like this. That's why he can't shake the feeling that there's something wrong with his soul."  They are not weak or insufficient. They are strong, enough, and amazing. It never hurts to hear and feel this.  **9. Encourage them to get professional help**  Finally, there will be parts of this that you cannot solve. You are one of the many support systems he/she has. Encourage them to go to therapy and seek professional help.  If they do get prescribed medication, it will not be perfect from the start so be prepared to go through the various stages of finding the correct treatment too. It will be draining, expensive, and tiring. Be there for them. Just be there.  I hope tonight, you can go back home and give your loved ones a tight hug. Thank you, Reddit.
53f4ca637653327ca22db931d3bac6aa3357209bb9a86f0cad6a4e14797a4e3b;;;My physical and emotional response to the thought of doing an unpleasant task are completely inconsistent with reality and logical reasoning, and it means I have to overcome disproportionately large mental barriers to complete normal tasks.;;;One of the worst parts of ADHD for me is that my physical and emotional reaction to the thought of doing a task which I perceive as even remotely unpleasant is way out of sync with reality. Right now I have to add a couple of courses to my university schedule but I've put it off for a couple weeks, now I'm not sure if they are still going to be available. Logically, I know It will take maybe 30 minutes to 1 hour at most to go through my program planning guide and sort everything out, and I would feel content and guilt-free after, but here I am stewing in anxiety and despair, silently struggling for two weeks to overcome this invisible, seemingly insurmountable barrier that my messed up brain made for me. Right now my reality is that doing this task *feels* like it is going to be the worst thing ever, and I have to get through this big emotional trial just to proceed to a relatively easy task.   ADHD people constantly struggle to overcome these incongruently large, sometimes enormous internal barriers caused by our messed up brains just to accomplish basic tasks in order to function as adults in our society. But most of the population don't encounter or understand such incongruous cognitive barriers, they don't understand what it's like to live like this, the extent to which we internally struggle and fight against ourselves every day. Some of them even have the audacity to tell you that you're making it up, that you're just not trying hard enough, that you're weak, that you're lazy. And sometimes we start to think that maybe we are.  But never here. We're here for each other all the time, understanding, helping each other through and pulling each other up. Thank you to every one of you, and thank you for coming to my ted talk.

I still feel deep kinship with this community, and truly felt that I related to the kinds of symptoms people describe here. I believe that knowing yourself is extremely important, and just because I am labeled as something separate than what I thought I had does not mean that I relate differently to my problems. Subscribing to this subreddit still allows me to see common threads in my own behavioral patterns. I also want to talk to those who might think they have ADHD but are undiagnosed. You might be like me, and have another weird brain symptom aside from ADHD! You might want to take a page out of my book, go get tested and find out for yourself. Saying you have undiagnosed ADHD is unfair to those who went through the process. You might relate as deeply as I did to those who actually have this problem, and actually not have it at all. I have seen people say they have undiagnosed ADHD on here, but try to be fair to them by not self-diagnosing. I am thankful to have had the benefit of seeing all of your wonderful posts, and keep being weird.  EDIT: in no way did I intend to make you feel like you don’t belong here if you are undiagnosed or don’t actually have ADHD. Like I mentioned, this sub has helped me tremendously and I love you all.

I also plan to try to apply some of this stuff to my own life, although there's obviously not enough info here to do therapy on yourself (and I wouldn't recommend it).  The presenter was Dr. Mary Solanto, and the manual she published can be found [here](https://www.guilford.com/books/Cognitive-Behavioral-Therapy-for-Adult-ADHD/Mary-Solanto/9781462509638) (not sponsored lol).  I'm not endorsing it or suggesting you buy it, just wanted to be transparent with where I'm getting all of this :)  The speaker described a cognitive-behavioral group therapy treatment for ADHD.  It's designed to take place over 12 sessions of 2 hours each, for a group of 6-10 people with ADHD.  The treatment's not a good fit for everyone (people with more severe disorders on top of ADHD might need to have those treated first, for instance) but it's been adapted for use with college students, veterans, etc.  It seemed pretty effective based on randomized control trials, and it also sounded like stuff that would be personally helpful for me.  Below, I'll describe some of the features of the treatment that might be helpful to know.    **Treatment goals:**  Improving "TOP" skills-- Time management, Organization, and Planning.  The rationale for focusing on these skills was that deficits in these areas are possibly the most universal feature of ADHD.  And being bad at those really sucks lol.  *(One side note is that the speaker described hyperfocus as "Difficulty switching from a task that's rewarding but less important to a task that's less rewarding but more important" which I think is an interesting way of looking at it.)*  **Treatment methods:**  * Teaching specific skills, like planner use and filing systems    * Part of the treatment involves regular use of a planner, which should be checked regularly.  I'm not sure if it's supposed to be 3 times a day or *at least* 3 times a day, but the speaker said something along those lines.    * You should have only 1 planner, it should be easy to enter tasks, and it should be easily portable * Teaching "rules," or helpful self-talk, to guide behaviors    * We tend to think about tasks in unhelpful ways, and correcting that can make us feel better and more capable and prepared. * Implementing self-reinforcement strategies that are contingent upon the completion of aversive or boring tasks    * We don't do boring or unpleasant things largely because they aren't rewarding enough, so using strategies that make those tasks feel more rewarding will help make it easier to get them started and finished.    * Pairing unpleasant and pleasant tasks together    * Using naturally occurring reinforcers * Practicing visualizing long-term rewards    * In ADHD, we view rewards that are farther in the future as being way less valuable than immediate rewards, which makes planning for the future and acting towards future goals really hard.      * Visualizing those long-term goals is thought to help us feel like those future rewards are more valuable in the present.  * Reducing demoralization, anxiety, and perfectionism    * Using traditional cognitive-behavioral strategies, like challenging negative thoughts.   * Practicing within sessions and at home    * Getting support from group members and positive reinforcement from therapists to keep people engaged and motivated.  **Features of treatment**  * Mantras (the "rules" mentioned earlier)    * Basically, reminders to tell yourself during the day to help you engage in more adaptive behaviors    * The mantras described were:       * "If it's not in the planner, it doesn't exist."       * "If I'm having trouble getting started, then the first step is too big."  (Can be applied iteratively, until there's a first step that's small enough.  I personally love this one.)       * "All things must be done in the order of their priority"       * "Getting started is the hardest part."  (It can take a lot of energy to get started, but after that, things tend to take less effort)       * "A place for everything and everything in its place" (for staying organized)       * "Out of sight, out of mind" (for controlling distractions) * Homework (they call it Home Experiences or something, but it's basically homework)    * Gets gradually more challenging over the sessions.    * An example of an early assignment is to choose one relatively easy task that you've been procrastinating on that'll take less than 1 hour, schedule when you'll do it, do it, and then provide yourself some reinforcement for doing it.    * When you do the homework, therapists will cheer you on and ask questions about how you did it.    * When you don't do the homework, they'll help you identify and address any obstacles to doing it, and help you figure out strategies to do it next time.  **My personal takeaways**  * Maybe I should try using a planner again lol * I might try the mantras and see if they help * Focusing on positive reinforcement for tasks sounds pretty helpful.  I might try to fine-tune how and when I reward/reinforce myself  &#x200B;  Hope this was educational for you all!  \--  It's not open to everyone so I can't invite y'all, but I want to share the insights.  Also, if there are any questions you have, I can try to get answers for you, but no guarantees the presenters will read or answer my questions.  (as a little background, I'm ADHD & also a clinical psych grad student, and the webinar is through a conference I'm virtually attending.)

Original author unknown;;;17 Things Your ADHD Child Would Tell You if They Could:   PLEASE NOTE:  THIS IS REPOSTED FROM A FB SHARE.  IF anyone happens upon the original author of this piece, please let me know so that I can give credit where it's due. I would love for that person to know what kind of impact their words have made on all of us.  In the meantime, I will attempt to back track the post on fb...      UPDATE: OP FOUND! Sarah Forbes authored this list of beautiful words that has brought us all to tears.  She has some great adhd content on her blog, so be sure to check it out. http://www.graceunderpressure.blog  1. I’m trying way harder than you’ll ever know even though it doesn’t seem like it to you. I really, truly am.  2. Criticising me or getting angry at me that my brain doesn’t work better doesn’t help me. It makes me hate myself even more.  3. I’m painfully aware of all the areas that I’m not measuring up. Instead of making a big deal about my shortcomings, try to find ways to help me.  4. An accommodation isn’t the same as enabling. If you help me where I’m genuinely struggling, I’m going to be grateful. Don’t assume that I’m manipulating you.  5. I’m not doing this to you, it’s NOT something I am doing on purpose.  6. If you think it’s hard to live with me, imagine trying to live inside a body that won’t do what you want it to do.  7. My brain doesn’t work right but I don’t know how to tell you that. It makes me angry and unkind, but I’m not trying to be that way.  8. When I’m being horrible, what I really need is for you to tell me you’ll love me no matter what. And maybe hug me, too. I probably believe that I’m unlovable, so prove me wrong.  9. I know that my lack of motivation is frustrating, but pushing harder doesn’t help me do better.  10. My anger and frustration is a result of my brain not processing properly. When I’m overwhelmed and freaking out, don’t escalate by freaking out or getting angry too. I need you to be calm and show me that everything’s going to be fine even when I feel like it’s not.  11. If I get overwhelmed, don’t expect me to sort out the problem all by myself. The part of my brain the controls regulation doesn’t work properly. That’s why I need your help to regulate.  12. Don’t try to break me of things that you see as weaknesses. My sensitivity as a child means I’ll be compassionate as an adult. My stubbornness as a child means I’ll be independent and assertive as an adult. Instead of squashing these characteristics, channel them toward something good that can benefit me when I’m older. Don’t view me as something that needs fixed or toughened up.  13. Don’t be afraid of labeling me. A label gives me answers and help. If my condition is serious enough to need to be diagnosed, you can guarantee that I’ve noticed something’s wrong and I’m wondering why I’m different too. Unless you tell me what’s going on, I’m likely to grow up angry and confused about why everyone has it all together and I don’t. A label means I can get help, it gives me answers and vindication.  14. I have a real, actual medical condition in my brain. It’s just as real as if I had Type 1 Diabetes. Just like Diabetes, I need help to deal with the condition. No one tells someone with Type 1 Diabetes that they are lazy if they’re tired because their blood sugar is low. They understand that it’s part of the condition.   Please, please, please learn about my condition, and don’t blame me for things that are out of my control. Just like leaving Type 1 Diabetes untreated results in serious complications and even death, untreated ADHD can lead to serious complications – potentially including death. Thankfully, there are many ways to treat ADHD (and medication isn’t the only way but a sure way to help me).  15. My frontal lobe is developing 30% behind normal. Please understand this and don’t put me in situations I’m not ready to handle. If you give me responsibility that’s beyond my developmental age, don’t be angry with me that I do poorly. That’s setting me up for failure, and that’s just cruel.  16. Stop expecting me to be normal. I can’t be. Not for all my trying. Until you accept that, I’ll always be a failure in your eyes, and I’ll always view myself as not good enough.  17. You have the power to make me miserable by how you treat me. Remember to treat me with love and grace. Treat me how you would want to be treated if you were struggling with a problem in your brain. I may make myself miserable sometimes, but don’t add to that by treating me poorly. When in doubt, be kind. Believe me, I need your kindness, love, support, time and validation.

The account I’m currently on is new cus too many people knew my old username, but I’ve been following this sub for awhile and always felt inspired by people’s posts, so I wanted to share my own accomplishment.   After having applied to 5 grad schools because I didn’t think I’d get in anywhere, I have received an admissions offer from EVERY SCHOOL I APPLIED TO, including the best schools in my field!!! I AM IN SHOCK!!!!!!!!   I always thought I was stupid. Sometimes, I’d have moments where I’d convince myself of my intelligence, but then I’d go to school and see how easily everyone else could learn and immediately get discouraged. I thought my brain didn’t work.   Over the years, I’ve figured out what strategies are the most helpful for learning and test-taking. I’ll make another post in the future about the best strategies that have helped me get through school and university. My biggest tip: don’t do what everyone else is doing and expect it to work for you. Our brains are different but we are SO LUCKY to have ADHD. Hyperfocus and the procrastination adrenaline have turned from inconveniences into traits I utilize for my success.   I wanted to share this with you guys so you know it’s possible to achieve all of your dreams, no matter how hard things get with ADHD. We are all smarter than we give ourselves credit for!  Edit: Thank you so much for all of your support. So emotional :) study tips here https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/b3kwvk/how_to_leverage_your_adhd_to_succeed_in_school_as/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x

I'm just gonna roll with my adhd from now on out;;;i'm in my early 30's which isn't old old but it's certainly not young. and trying to fight my adhd is only going to get MORE tiring, even with adderall.  I'm no long going to live my life out by prospects of permanence but rather by accomplishments.  I hate the term bucketlist because i don't wanna give off suicidal vibes, but ive just spent the entire night making up a big ass list of things i've done and want to get done and i'm just gonna try to get through that list for however many weeks/months/or years i have left. no time limit. just get through it.   no more anxiety from thinking, "hurr well if i choose to (x field) does that mean im just gonna have to be a (x field person) for the rest of my life?". Nope. i'm done with all that.   travel, see the northern lights, go to an Amsterdam brothel, do shrooms, get through my reading list, get tattoos, learn to cook a solid beef wellington, write a short novel, star in a local play, etc  adios expectations of settling down in a normal life.  **edit: holyy crap. welp, i def wasn't expecting this much of a response when i woke up. i just got through 100+ supportive comments, stories, and anecdotes and i just wanted to say ty to everyone here for being so awesome.**
e40bf5a4dc1bfaeb767444564c5b18ad8723ed8b4d861afc8e509b6245399bc8;;;In our house, "Tony Stark" is a verb;;;This is something that my brother started saying years ago before we ever had a clue that I had ADHD.  He just thought it was me being ridiculous and used the term endearingly, but it's stuck!    I was listening to an ADHD for adults podcast and the speaker was talking about how we have "the tendency to go 'all in' and become experts in this subject, but while using all resources and hyperfocusing to the extent that it's uncanny to others how quickly we become proficient in whatever subject it is."  I kept waiting for her to use the word but then realized, most people probably don't!   We call this 'Tony Stark-ing.'  (From the scene *"when did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?"  "last night"*)     >me:  "So I got really into leather sewing--"  >husband:  "Like, Tony Stark level, or less?"  or  >me: "I just Tony Starked orthotropics, let me tell you what I learned..."  you get the idea.  We used it last night during conversation and I just thought this sub might get a kick out of it or have similar ties to that exchange.  Tony (and the muse behind his character...Howard Hughes) are big personal idols of mine and my ADHD/OCD husband.  Edit: Here's the podcast!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ft4eNY_IPfY  Also, to all of you saying that Tony Stark totally has ADHD, of course he does!  I'd Tony Stark about it here inappropriately, but I'm actually more into his real-life inspiration, Howard Hughes, who did amazing things with his undiagnosed combo. If you have ADHD and/or OCD, then he's a name and face I'd recommend reading up on or watching the Aviator at least.    The media likes to focus on his cRaZy rEcLUsIvE eCcEnTRic SiDe, but he was so much more than that.  After breaking a world speed record and crashing into a beet field because he was too busy being an adrenaline junkie and trying to break his own record to stop and refuel (lol) his colleagues ran up to him, ambulance and all, and he was sitting next to the plane and said "We can fix her, she'll go faster."   This pretty much sums up all of ADHD for me, and I plan on getting a tattoo of 'she'll go faster' somewhere to commemorate it.  Enough excited oversharing! Sorry!

It’s difficult for me to start any long term goals because I know they won’t get completed as I will give up part way through. I’m not really sure if it’s my Aspergers which I have been diagnosed for, or if I also have ADHD.    It really sucks because there are things I want to succeed but never manage to do that.  Does anyone else have the same experience?
4054e03f7f3544e06f7605cb739948dfb2e4d95577656441bb7f593c7d998a2f;;;Aside from "lack of focus" apparently "can't self start" is also a major ADHD problem that doesn't get discussed as much?;;;We all know that the inability to focus is a major problem with ADHD.  But can we also discuss the inability to get started on a task without outside motivation?  This seems to be a secondary ADHD problem that doesn't get talked about as much.  This seems to be a source of ADJD people being labled as "lazy" because we sometimes lack the ability/motivation to get up and *just do it*.   I remember seeing a Russell Barkley video a while back where he makes the analogy of a rocket sitting on a launch pad, but it won't go anywhere because there's no fuel in it.  I suppose this could also be a metaphor for the lack of dopamine to self start which just isn't there.  Dopamine is strongly related to motivation.   Comments anyone?
e3777673bfa72f0e75fc0f6cf6d9a7228d83e95db48cffd815dc9fc31a94d251;;;accidentally made my therapist cry yesterday lads;;;i was talking to my therapist about how i was going to set up an appointment to hopefully get rediagnosed (i was diagnosed as a child but that was quite a while ago) with ADHD and get on medication. the executive dysfunction and focus issues have really been holding me back and it feels like it's only been getting worse.  and i told her, "sometimes i get so excited because i can so clearly imagine the kind of person i could be if i had medication to help me. it's like i'm stuck inside."  and she said, "yeah." (like in understanding) but her voice was shaky and when i looked up she had tears in her eyes. she recovered very quickly and continued on with the conversation, but i was surprised to see her react in that way.  it was a really small thing, but for some reason it's made me... more determined to tackle this thing? like, my therapist has always been a very empathetic person but right then i felt especially seen and validated. like i really deserved to do whatever it takes to lead a better life.  **edit:** to the people who are completely and utterly losing their minds in the comment section because my therapist teared up at something i had to say for a few seconds... uhhh, don't. you are making a mountain out of a molehill and the world isn't going to come to an end because my therapist dropped the illusion of being emotionless that you cherish so deeply for a few seconds.  i did not think my therapist emotionally connecting to me was a bad thing and my life didn't come to a catastrophic end when it happened. i thought it was positive, and it made me feel more confident about sharing my experiences and thoughts with her. i appreciate the armchair psychology, though! <3  **edit again:** wow, i did not expect this post to take off in any way, but thank you all for your comments, thoughts and kind words! it means a lot!  **edit again again:** W O W HOLY STINK, SILVER AND GOLD. WOW WOW WOW. thank you so much u/dangnguyenofficial for the gold! i dunno what to say!
2acbd83f6ac5d0007959cc77d6265b3469b2f788f0c825c3ddf3c69e0aba1d0b;;;I feel like i was programmed to fail at life, i have never talked about this with anyone and seriously need to air some of it out. On the brink of suicide.;;;I’m 24 with no accomplishments in life and with horrible social anxiety, i’m a closeted gay in a strictly islamic family and to top it off i probably also have ADD which explains the 0 progression. If there is a god, he sent me to this earth to be miserable.   Starting off with my teenage years, i always had horrible grades, i was always pushed aside during group projects on high school and college cause i could never do anything. Everyone saw me as the stupid student. And i’ve always felt that way.    When friends asked how my grades were i would lie and say i’d get B’s minimum. Lies, cause all my friends got amazing grades, i didn’t want to feel excluded. My brain never took in any of the information given during class. I would blindly stare at the board the teacher was writing on as to not pull any unwanted attention, but i never got any of the information.    I failed most courses and got E or D’s on the ones that i passed, not because i was stupid but because i never arrived to class on time despite the countless warnings and never handed in any of my assignments on time. I would work on them past deadline and finish them as fast as possible resulting in E’s.    Where i live, if you’re present in school enough, you get paid. I didn’t get paid once cause i was one hour late, EVERYDAY. None of it was ever intentional, i said i would better myself everyday. Never happened.    Teachers understood that there was something wrong with me during high school and sent me away to try to pinpoint the problem. They were testing me for dyslexia, showing me pictures of animals, objects, colours and told me to name them. My mom was absolutely livid cause they were testing her son for abnormalities, she fought everyone there. I remember it clear as day. I had special teachers, and students were making fun of me cause i had special needs and didn’t go to the ”normal people” teachers.   At the end of college, all the students would make gifts for eachother. Writing on paper plates what each student would be remembered for. My famous catchphrase the students had written on my paper plate, ”I’m sorry the bus was late!” They thought it was funny. I didn’t. I laughed at the time though.    I’ve always known what ADHD was but had never read about it in indepth until recently.    I can relate in every single aspect, i actually flailed in excitement cause for once i actually felt like i belonged somewhere. I felt like i finally had an explanation to being late everyday, never handing in anything on time and the hours of procrastination and disability to sit still. There might be medications for me that may help me better my life.    I also read about hyperfocus, which reminded me of the times i actually did well. But that was only when the topic at hand was something i found interesting. Students were assigned to present to class a subject they were passionate about, which was astronomy in my case. I got an A, for the first time. My teacher was praising me for months about it, it surely felt good and was the only bright moment i had during all my school years. I’ll never forget it.    I told my sister and mother about my situation and what i had read expecting some sort of understanding. Boy, was i wrong, my sister had a mental breakdown crying and throwing herself here and there INFRONT of her children as if i had showed her that i had been diagnosed with cancer. My mom went into a fit of rage screaming at me, her son can’t not be perfect. Her son can’t be abnormal. I, completely dissapointed swiped it under the rug and tried to forget what i had read. This happened six months ago and am today in this situation. I feel like this is the end of the line for me.    I have hopes and dreams but at this point it looks like i will never achieve them cause i never make any form of progression. I weren’t able to apply to good schools cause of my shitty grades and now unable to apply to university cause of the same reason.    All of this inferior treatment i got through out the years has made me develop heavy social anxiety and made me believe that i am simply not good enough.    If my parents found out i was gay, they would throw me out without a second thought and that would be the end of me. I try to stay on their good side cause i have nowhere to go. I can’t move out cause i don’t have a job, i’m pathetic.    They pressure me to find a job every other day and i try my hardest but simply end up looking weak and pathetic, i tried applying for a job earlier this month and completely humiliated myself. The interviewer asked me to tell her about myself and i froze up and couldn’t say anything. I couldn’t answer a simple question.    My family constantly compares me to other people my age and what they have accomplished while i have done nothing.    I know how long this was and i sincerely apologize for taking your time. If you read all the way down here, thank you very much.   EDIT: Thank you so much for all the support and beautiful comments, you have no idea how much it means to me. It’s comforting to know that i’m not in this alone.

But hitting me with, “You? You don’t have that!” after I’ve just confided in you... who gave you the authority to decide??  Here’s some of those gems:   — “Then *everyone* has ADHD.”  — “Who gave you that diagnosis? It’s bullshit.”  — “Oh, did you self-diagnose?”  — “Inability to commit to projects? Bad time management? Ha, those aren’t real symptoms.”  — “I used to work at a psych ward [as a teacher, not a doctor], I know what *real* ADHD looks like.”  — “How many shrinks did you go to to get that diagnosis? You’re only doing it for the drugs.” [Funny thing, I’m not taking any ADHD meds.]   Edit: oh yeah, another one I heard: “don’t go taking those meds now, you know you can train yourself to get rid of your symptoms, right?” Thanks Karen, I’ll just yoga them away, I guess.   ^(This post was brought to you by my lovely aunt, who said most of these things to me the other day.)
2db15475a2bbb10fa439ea6ba3b8296a70dc87a7a739ff234ce1f9449cba0df2;;;Just found out I’ve been attending the wrong class for the past month.;;;This morning I went in to my art history class at 8:00am to find the auditorium doors locked. I thought okay, so class is canceled, weird that I didn’t get an email about it. So I went home, hopped on my computer and checked the classroom page with all upcoming assignments; and to my surprise I saw that I had my first exam due at 11:00am with a text submission field. I figured it must be an online exam and I just missed the announcement last class and that must’ve been why no one was there. So I looked all over the web page to try to find a portal to the exam questions but it was no where to be found. Finally I decided to email my professor and ask him where to find the exam questions. He responds:   “That’s right. There are no exam questions posted. Learn the material, if it’s not too late, and do the best to answer the questions I’ll put to you”  This just makes me more confused so I respond explaining that I’ve been reading my material and I see that the exam is due at 11 but I can’t find where to submit it.  Prof: “Oh, I see. The exam’s taking place during the class period. In the usual room. Sorry for the confusion.”  At this point I’m freaking out and frantically explaining that I was there and I must’ve gotten locked out.  Prof: “just turn up before our 11:00 start time, is that a problem?”  I thought that’s weird that it’s scheduled at 11:00 instead of 8 but whatever.  I showed up to class at 11 and immediately noticed it was a completely different and smaller crowd of students and a professor I’ve never seen before.. after all that, that was the moment I realized I’ve been attending an art appreciation class with a completely different instructor at 8am 3 days a week for the past month. The course material was similar enough to the material online that i didn’t ever question it.  I quietly explained the situation to the professor, took the exam, and talked to him about it after class. We both laughed about it and he explained I should be able to pass the class comfortably but I can’t make an A due to the school’s attendance policy. Such a crazy morning.

Literally 15 minutes ago”  Me: “I don’t remember, can you repeat the answer?”  Them: “no. Listen better next time”  Congrats you have solved my ADD..
2206d166bdb7eb2594065b7ec0f05fc99f33d5b151b6dcb684d6fc7b1ef3a03a;;;New doctor: "everyone works better on stimulants, it's not fair that you should get an advantage";;;I guess it's time to find a new doctor. Switched jobs and my old doctor (who I didn't really like anyway, but at least he never questioned my adderall) doesn't take my new insurance. Got the morning off work, took the train into the city to visit a brand new doctor. She acts nice but confesses that she has a "bias" against stimulants and she's not sure if ADHD is "real". Then she says she'll prescribe it but we need to develop a better long term plan, yada yada, and then she orders a fucking DRUG SCREEN. I have never been asked to take a drug screen when being prescribed adderall (the script is only 10 mg, by the way). I told her I don't appreciate being treated like a criminal when I'm just trying to get the medicine I need to bring me to baseline.  Now I'm very frustrated. She did say she'll prescribe it, but I don't know if I want to work with a doctor who's so dismissive of my very fucking real brain problems that I've struggled with for the past 20-25 years.   And I live in the U.S., so finding a new doctor is expensive and time consuming and it's impossible to ever really know how much it might cost, especially if they insist on ordering labs.

I mentioned it to him in my film class and how it's actually a bigger struggle than I thought it would be, especially when wearing headsets. I really have to focus and concentrate to make sure everything goes smoothly, and I get easily overstimulated.  I emailed him in length about this struggle and what my disorder is. I just asked to not be put on as director anymore because it was overwhelming -- it was the only thing I directly asked for. But then, I additionally mentioned my struggle with hearing and taking in directions. I just said it might take me a little longer to remember how to work the big equipment. Thought nothing of it and sent the email.  The next day we were learning how to use graphics equipment. He handed everyone in the class a printed-out version of directions, brushing it off as a cheat-sheet. Didn't single me out. Didn't talk to me after or anything. Just introduced it as a cheat sheet.  I almost cried right then and there, to be honest. I didn't even *ask* for it, and he printed the directions out -- and didn't make it obvious it was done for me. Sometimes professors can be fucking fantastic.

Shit now what do I do? Feels weird not having class work to fill in the boring parts...
07f4ad45981077d2eb2ff6da0151dc626b0b5c57d35cf6f689ca31aea957e7a0;;;I know none of you care, but I just went to see my counselor again, and it turns out I might have more than just ADHD.;;;So about an hour ago I went to see my (amazing) counselor. This was only my 3rd time seeing him, but I love him. Anyways, he was asking me questions about my new meds. He was kinda disappointed after I told him I didn't feel different in any way considering I'm taking 20mg (I have been for a month) He started asking me questions (or at least he was trying to as I rambled on about the anatomy of a dragon) about how I read social cues and stuff like that. Simple answer: I don't. I just keep talking on and on until someone snaps me out of it. He also noticed I struggle with making eye contact during a conversation and how large my vocabulary is and how intelligent I am (according to him). I heard him talking to my mom as I casually sketched in my sketchbook, and I heard him talking about how I may have Asperger's along with my ADHD. So yeah. That's a thing that happened.  Edit: Clearly, you all care way more than I thought you would lol. I would change the title, but it won't let me, so we are just going to pretend the "I know none of you care" bit isn't there. :)
