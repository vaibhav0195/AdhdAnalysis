They barely want to interact when we’re home together, but they instantly miss me when we’re apart. It’s very sweet, but it’s weird for me to switch into being an attentive partner to my ADHD when they usually just want to be left alone.   I guess related to this is that my SO will go long periods of time without actively seeking out my attention or our interactions. Most interactions are instigated by me. But then a couple times a year they will look at me and say something like “My God, you’re beautiful,” almost with surprise. It’s very sweet and of course I’m very sweet in response, but I can’t help but feel like they haven’t REALLY looked at me or noticed me in a long time. Haha. I just find it so interesting.   Just curious if anyone else experiences this.
