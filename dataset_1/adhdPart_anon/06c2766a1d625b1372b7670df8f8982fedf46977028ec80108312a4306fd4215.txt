Even if they meant to. So happy Valentineâ€™s Day to you all from me. Cause I know most of us wonâ€™t get one from our significant others and thatâ€™s okay

Sometimes I look at other relationships and envy how simple they are. (I feel horrible saying this :( Sometimes I just really not in the mood for my SO to have a melt down or be grumpy. Sometimes when they are having a down day itâ€™s literally like dragging another human around all day, like a led lined jacket. Itâ€™s exhausting. All I do is worry about wether they are okay. If they took their medication. If they got enough sleep. Have they eaten. I love my SO very much but sometimes I wish we had a normal relationship and I feel horrible for saying that.
