And you know, tools, materials, dust, garbages are just everywhere. But... Sriracha? He said he has no idea but it was in the bathroom and I just couldn't stop laughingü§£ Happy New Yearüéâ;;;

My resentment goes up, my grace goes down.  I become an angry person I dont want to be, when I browse here.   Anyone else?   I'm going to leave this place behind, and choose to focus on positive things of life. It's too beautiful a life to spend being negative about my spouse.

As an ADHD wife, with a non-ADHD partner; I have recently decidEd to get treated with medication again. Although the medication helps on many levels, it doesn't do everything. *Because it is only of recent, within the last few weeks that I have learned how deeply ADHD behaviours have affected my marriage - I just want to share my thoughts and understandings at this juncture*. Of course this is just from my point of view but it may shed some light on what's going on inside our minds and at least help me get this off my chest.  **ADHD : no medication, when the meds wear off**  * We are constantly changing our minds and that's just us * **We don't intend to hurt you** or others by what we say, forget or don't say * We are very **emotional and overly reactive** \- but I assure you, once when we get upset and say something we don't mean, after some time - after we actually are able to cool off - we will usually see somewhat rationally again and say what we do mean. The intensity on how deeply we feel emotion is about 10x-20x how deeply you feel an emotion. * **We have no idea how much we live in awareness we have**  \- we are literally constantly distracted or daydreaming even if we think we are focusing * We are great at putting the **mask on of "normality"** and although we may get used to it - we are struggling inside in ways most cannot imagine. It zaps us of energy * **We are operating on auto-pilot**. We literally are a series of conditioned reactions. Not because we want to, but because until we are diagnosed and take action for some sort of treatment (medication, behavioural or both) - we have no idea that this is happening * When we are crying, upset or in a emotionally vulnerable state, **please don't give us advise - just listen to us compassionately.** Wait until we are calm and better to offer any advice. * You may feel like you don't really know us because we can't properly communicate our thoughts * **We may text you or interrupt a lot** **in conversation**\- but that's because we want to share something before we forget it. * Self confidence is usually low for us - and a chronic condition. Just as are negative thoughts. * **We aren't lying** If it seems like we are lying, you have to understand that because our emotions and thoughts change so rapidly - we often have a different perception when answering your question the first time than the second time. Or we just freaking forgot. Our perceptions, and therefore related memories, change with our moods (which are related to our changing thoughts)  **ADHD :** **with medication/recently began being treated**  * **Give us some time to get used to our new working brains**. We are now processing things differently and beginning to see things with fresh eyes. * **ACCEPTANCE**. Please also give us some time to accept this entire ADHD diagnoses and the treatment. There is so much social stigma with it that it can be hard to swallow. For me, I have spent time looking back and seeing how many people I inadvertently hurt and have gone through periods of grief too. We may be relentlessly researching to understand ADHD, but understanding and learning is key for us to move on to acceptance * **Meds are only part of the solution** \- and that's if we can get them right. We also need to re-learn some habits that may not be addressed with medication; procrastination - how to organise - how to communicate - how to listen and a zillion other things. Your support is also invaluable and I ask that you all take the time to educate yourselves. * **The meds wear off** (psycho-stimulants) - and when they wear off, our ADHD comes back immediately (see first part of post). Until we get used to this and find/learn coping mechanisms this will happen  and/or the proper treatment has been found (duration of optimal efficacy with little or no side effects). It has to wear off sometime, or we may be up too late at night. * **If we behave differently** please let us know. * **Remind us to be patient with ourselves.** Even with meds we still have this hardwired need for perfection and to get things done NOW. We aim for that even harder with meds sometimes. Remind us about this. * **We may re-evaluate life and see things from a new point of view because we are finally able to truly be self aware and introspect for the first time.**  EDITS¬†OCTOBER¬†6,¬†2018:  * If we are trying a new med/dosage and end up staying up later than usual (or sleeping earlier), don't give us crap - our bodies need to adjust. * If you have an important message you need us to attend to - please take us away from our daily environments to stimulate and emphasize that "this is important". The same surroundings can lead to day dreaming. * If we discover new hobbies, nurture us - learn with us. We haven't had working brains in a while and when they do work, we discover life. * Try not to force us to talk about anything, suggest something smaller first or a letter (email) * Help us create systems that work for us, not mold us into systems that work for you. * We process language differently than neurotypicals so clarification on both parties is often needed * Sit down and communicate with us, not just talk. Let's Have a conversation.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;
dc937b59892604f5a86ac96936cd7ff09e25f18ae6b758e8014a24c7fa039e91;;;Feels like ADHD (dx) BF isn‚Äôt interested;;; (31M) BF will ask me (27F) what I want to watch on tv, and when I pick something he‚Äôs not interested in - he doesn‚Äôt watch it. He just plays ‚Äútower defense‚Äù games on his phone, and occasionally looks up. But when he picks, he does watch it - and there‚Äôs only so much of Joe Rogan I can watch on YouTube lol. I feel guilty because he has ADHD (dx) and it‚Äôs difficult for him to follow most of our casual conversations.   Also for example, if I‚Äôm telling him a story:  ‚ÄúBanana called orange and told him that he went skiing today and broke his leg.‚Äù  He‚Äôll cut me off and either fill in the sentence for me (which is always the wrong answer) or he‚Äôll cut me off to tell me a story about someone he knows that broke their leg, and then (because I have a short attention span) we‚Äôll talk about that, and never actually talk about my story.   I‚Äôm starting to wonder if he‚Äôs even interested in anything I say..and I‚Äôve said that to him and he tells me how sorry he is, he loves me and doesn‚Äôt want me to feel like this. That it‚Äôs completely not true, and that he promises that he‚Äôs trying, it‚Äôs just really hard.   I‚Äôm patient, it doesn‚Äôt bother me that I usually have to keep my sentences short and to the point. But I would rather just like not offer to watch tv together if he‚Äôs not going to watch it. I‚Äôd rather just not talk if he‚Äôs always going to cut me off. Which I know has its consequences.   Side note- we have a really great relationship, I cannot stress to you all enough that he really is an amazing man in every single other way. I just don‚Äôt know how to bring this up without it creating an argument. I really dislike fighting, I love him so much. But I don‚Äôt want to hold it in, and eventually feel defeated and bitter.   Any advice that does not involve breaking up?

My boyfriend is hard to be around on the weekends. I had plans to go to the beach today with a friend, partly to avoid him, but also because I have more social needs than my boyfriend can provide. My friend canceled the beach trip I was really looking forward to. And my boyfriend and I had a rough day (no surprises there). My boyfriend was angry at himself throughout the day, because he couldn't relax. When I wasn't feeling completely ignored, I felt like I was being picked on. I told my boyfriend I was leaving, and that I really needed some social interaction today. When I came back home I was still feeling bad and was tearful. My boyfriend realized and said he was going to stay with me and give me attention. I was so relieved he was able to figure this out. I know I said it in plain English, but even that does not work sometimes. He comforted me for a bit, but it was not long before he began crying and saying he's been feeling depressed lately. So I comforted him, and my feelings were second to his again (and again and again). Later we went out to eat, and we came back home. My boyfriend was breathing very shallow, I asked if he felt okay and that he was breathing shallow. He immediately took it as a criticism, and said I was making him self conscious. Now he's having an RSD reaction to a mild concern I voiced. I'm feeling like I'm at the end of my rope. I cannot do and say everything right. I'm so tired of having to be the voice of optimism and positive affirmation all the time, while my boyfriend is critical, angry, and grumpy.
dc937b59892604f5a86ac96936cd7ff09e25f18ae6b758e8014a24c7fa039e91;;;Can't ask partner to get anything while at the store;;;I've been reading so many posts here and it's helped me in many ways - sometimes made me feel like it could be worse, sometimes made me feel less alone in this and other times just made me laugh...because laughing is better than crying about some of these crazy-making things.  So here's my vent, and it's a tiny one! But so frustrating! When my ADHD spouse goes to the store, I can't text him to ask him to get something I think of that I know we need there. It leads to overwhelm. I recently asked him to look for nondairy yogurt and it took him 20 minutes to find it and then totally lost it with me over this. This drives me crazy. I hate inefficiency. End of vent. :)
