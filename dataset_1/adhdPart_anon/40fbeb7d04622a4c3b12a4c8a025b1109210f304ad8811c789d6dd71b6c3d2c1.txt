I really thought that if I put in enough work and love, eventually we would learn to live together. We didn't, although we became good at communicating, it only emphasised how different and awful we were together. The night we broke up I could finally breathe. Every day I come home to my own apartment and I thank God he isn't there hammering me about what I do and say. I'm not saying that adhd relationships are impossible, but this one were. The feeling of leaving him behind is relief and new found joy in living - I'm no longer crying everyday or arguing, I simply exist with myself and I feel so at ease at last.
