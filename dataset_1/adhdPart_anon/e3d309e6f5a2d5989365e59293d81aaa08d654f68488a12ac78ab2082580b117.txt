I just can't feel empathetic for my partner when they struggle with executive dysfunction, time blindness and hyperfixations because I also experience those things but manage them effectively, completely unmedicated. I have ASD and PTSD, which causes lots of ADHD symptoms, but I damn well manage because as a woman, I've never had a choice, I've always had to manage, long before I was diagnosed!!  On that note, how in the hell am I supposed to navigate their want for spontaneity and lack of routine with my NEED for structure and routine? Part of managing my mental health so well is structure and routine and when we're together, they just leave me in limbo, never knowing what's going on until it's already happening. They can't even plan a simple dinner without getting lost scrolling through their phone and I'm not able to cope with this. My mental health is suffering when I'm around them.  The funny thing is, I've heard structure is great for ADHD folks so why do they insist that their way is better, that living in chaos is functional when it's clearly not?? I've tried to talk to them about this but I don't think any of it is going in, I don't think they care enough to TRY to introduce structure. It seems like any coping skills I suggest that have helped me with these symptoms they experience, all the help I try to give either doesn't go in, or they try once and then give up when it's not easy. Please, I'm going to lose my Shit.

It's always my responsibility to create topics to talk about, and to maintain every conversation (we live apart). I'll talk about every mundane thing I've been doing, what I'm having for dinner, something interesting I've found online. When I ask him, it's like he's trying to be secretive, he'll tell me he's only been doing one thing...all day?? You never have anything to talk about at all?? Nothing interesting has happened? Why is it always my responsibility, I don't want to shoulder this entire burden anymore
