Think ADHD, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Dyslexia and other learning disabilities. The mission is to shift societal thinking away from the norm of "people with disabilities" to one that celebrates neurodiversity.   In our winter issue, we're focusing on the theme of dating and relationships, and the unique struggles neurodivergent people face. We're especially interested in stories where only one partner is neurotypical. We'd love to hear stories from you, and/or your partners, about what it's like. Even if you don't consider yourself a writer. Hoping some of you will contribute. The magazine is online and in print, and you can see guidelines here:  [https://www.divergents-magazine.org/submissions](https://www.divergents-magazine.org/submissions)  Hope to hear from you!
