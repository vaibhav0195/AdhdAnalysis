Neither is right or wrong.   It is important that if you want to maintain a healthy relationship, you observe what they do, and tweek your needs, to meet with patterns they already have. Work together.   For example, and this may seem silly- but if they put their clothes on the floor in the same spot every day and you hate it, put a laundry basket there.   If that doesn't work, try a different method until you find one that sticks. You will find one! Remain hopeful!
