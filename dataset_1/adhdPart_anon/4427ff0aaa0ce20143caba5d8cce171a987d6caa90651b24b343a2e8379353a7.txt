4427ff0aaa0ce20143caba5d8cce171a987d6caa90651b24b343a2e8379353a7;;;I’m so tired.;;;I’m 36 weeks pregnant tomorrow and I’m just so tired my dx husband, just doesn’t take his mental health seriously. He takes his meds but it ends there. I can’t do it anymore. I can’t do it for him anymore. When the baby comes, I can’t be on top of him. If he’s taking his meds, did he make the doc appt, how he is on refills? All while trying to maintain my sanity and keep a baby alive. I’m scared. I’m tired. I’m resentful. I’m not asking for much. I know it can be hard. And it’s also as if I enable. Because I do it. But if I don’t, it affects both of us. It affects me. I’ve given the whiteboards, the lists, the apps, therapy #’s, men’s group info. He’s an amazing guy. I love him to death but I’m going to have a mental breakdown if he doesn’t try methods that work for him. We started counseling and I really wish we did it sooner. Anyways, this was my vent. It’s my last day before maternity leave and I know he doesn’t remember and it’s all just sad.
