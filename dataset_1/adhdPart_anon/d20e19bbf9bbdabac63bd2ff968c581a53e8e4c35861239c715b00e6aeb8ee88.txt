I've viewed some pretty toxic comments toward people with ADHD, and it's both unhelpful and not very thoughtful.  Everyone deserves some compassion, there is always something left out of a story, it is not our place to judge people we do not know, rather, if we are able we should be encouraging education to further the understanding of anyone going through a particularly tough time. It's also not for us to judge if that time is actually tough or not.   We are not here to compare, we are here to help.  Please be kind.  Thank you everyone.

d20e19bbf9bbdabac63bd2ff968c581a53e8e4c35861239c715b00e6aeb8ee88;;;He apologized;;;This maybe aught to go in the weekly victories thread, but I also felt that this tale came with a valuable message.  My husband has this annoying learned behaviour of seeking to pacify someone when upset, even more so with me, I would guess because he can't handle seeing me hurt. I get it, but it's not the right way to go about things sometimes.  Well, yesterday marked thr 9th year of my dad passing, so I tried to keep busy and the usual. My husband asked me to talk about him; memories and things. I tried, but there's no much good stuff from my own past, and before I knew it, I was snot crying and in a mess. Instead of consoling me, he moved to pacify me.  I felt particularly vulnerable in that moment, as I hadn't ever said these things outloud, so it took it's toll on me. I got triggered, it didn't end well.   But it did end better than any other time something like this happened.  No shouting, no screaming. He did not push me once to talk to him. (previously would do anything to get me to react to him out of fear I suppose). He gave me my space, didn't react to my own sharp tongue, which means I also wasn't put in a position to say horrible things to make a point.   I woke up this morning feeling pretty low, and upon reflection, because he handled himself well, I was able to get my thoughts in order. I sent him a message outlining the main issue:  "I listen to you vent a lot, sometimes for hours, and when i was having a moment you sought to pacify me, after we literally had a conversation about how your mum does that to you. It's just not cool. i had never vocalized any of that to anyone in my life, not even anna, so i didn't know it would even upset me so bad. i didnt even know it was there. anyway, gonna try and work out to see if it helps me feel better because it's just not healthy for me to be feeling so low like this."  Even though he was at work, he called me back immediately.  He told me he understood completely what he had done, it wasn't his intention, he did not mean to hurt my feelings, and that I was right, and he will work harder on listening, and active listening. (there was more to it, but you get the idea)  There was no backpedaling, no anger, no trying to justify himself, no making it my problem; just pure acknowledgment of a mistake, and being quite remorseful for that mistake.  So guys and gals, if you know, you know. This just doesn't happen. Ever. There's always a fight about him not taking accountability for what he's done. The denial, the "No that's not it!". None of it was there this time.  The releif I felt in that moment was just.. I can't even tell you.  To see and understand that kind of progress from someone, I was just lost for words.  I wanted to share this with you all who might be struggling to work at your relationships, as there is a light at the end of the tunnel. There is hope.   Communication, respect, boundaries - all of these things help give a person enough foundation that they can manage them selves, grow, and learn.  Happy Friday everyone!
