I have ADHD - yesterday, it snowed really bad - today, I had work at 12. My husband told me “be up at 10:30, no later” He checked in on me at that time, saw that I was awake and starting to get ready - then wordlessly went outside and cleared my car 100% in “breathable” sneakers because he doesn’t have winter boots. We forgot to buy a shovel when we moved in, so he kicked the ground and cleared the snow as best as he could.  He then came in and helped me finish getting ready and getting everything I needed - hat, gloves, water bottle, wallet, etc. This was so extremely helpful - I’ve been doing really well being on time for work, but that’s with minimal traffic, not having to drive really slow, not having to defrost my car and clear it off. If I had been left to my own devices, I likely would have been really overwhelmed this morning, forgotten things, and possibly been late.   Thank you to all the partners who do such selfless acts. I don’t know how your partner feels, but it’s a breath of fresh air and helps me get “caught up” so I can function like a normal human being. I’m making dinner tonight, cleaning, and sharing my favorite ice cream with him.
