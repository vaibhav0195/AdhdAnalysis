Not med) acted a fool during the admit appt this morning- maybe he was trying to cheer me up or avoiding his own feels. It was embarassing! He wasn't wearing undies, and started getting a chub, jokingly rubbed it up on me. Dude....inappropriate!! Sent me a snapchat of him pissing in a bush next to the hospital while I was waiting to see the gyny. Giggling like a schoolgirl. I told him he's frucking terrible and a pest and to just go and leave me be for today! After the procedure he came for 10 min and announced "I have to poo and shower, Im gunna go home and come straight back". 2 HOURS later, I get a text of Im ready yet. I have been discharged and ready for 30 min at this point. Um, you said you were coming straight back dude. In a nutshell folks, you gotta be your OWN support person, useless as tits on a bull! To all the young players in early relationships with adhd men....THIS is the reality. They don't "change", it doesn't get better, in fact as life gets more complicated with bills, children and work, its infinitely HARDER. GOOD LUCK OUT THERE PEEPS LOL
