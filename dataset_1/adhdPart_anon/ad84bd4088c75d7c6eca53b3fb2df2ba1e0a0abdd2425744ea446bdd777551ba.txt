I hyperfocus on things so hard that everything and everyone else in my life gets neglected - children, pets, food, spouse, payments, chores;;;I have ADHD. Although undiagnosed i know it for a fact that it is 200% it. My entire life can be summed up by a timeline of series of things that I hyperfocussed on and excelled in. But it has come with a cost. Everything and everyone else gets neglected in the bargain - be it children, pets, food, payments, my own health, eating habits etc. I was wondering if there ever is a possibility that i could hope for a way i could have a work around or find a way to balance things just a little bit more. I am tired of hurting people because i got so lost that i forgot i had to put meals on the table. I am tired of disappointing my children especially. For example : they'd come back from school so hungry and hope there would be food in the house but all i did the entire day was scrub and clean and declutter an area of the house - hyperfocussing like a beast. Then when they'd be sad that i was neglecting them, I'd make up by ordering take away food - which is neither healthy, nutritious nor helping my budget.   I really hope some of you'll can help me with some hacks or work arounds you'll learnt along the way and share them with me. I'm desperate to bring some balance into my life so this mountain of guilt i can put it down, it just keeps growing. ðŸ˜ž
