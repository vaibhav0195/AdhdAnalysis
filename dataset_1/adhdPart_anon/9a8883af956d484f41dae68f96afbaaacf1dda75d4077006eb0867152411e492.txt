I go from spouse, friend, lover, to roommate in a matter of hours. Couple that with my inability to express my wants without guilt (thanks religious upbringing! I am in therapy and working hard on this) and it’s...not great.   We’ve made such strides this year in our connection, but the hyper fixation kills me every time. It gets to where I just stop considering them in how I manage my time because they do the same when they get like this, so what’s the point? Why bother asking when they’ll be home, why let them know where I’m going, when I’ll be back. Odds are they won’t even notice anyways.   I’ve already been informed that I’ll be alone all day tomorrow as they go chase the new thing. I’m not comfortable spending time indoors with friends (pandemic) and it’s January so I guess I’ll sleep in, work on my hobby until I’m bored then wait for it to be dark so I can work on a bottle of wine. I enjoy my own company but sometimes these phases make me wonder why we’re married if their attraction/affection with me is so cyclical.   What’s worse is when they realize they haven’t made eye contact with me in a week, and their solution to spending time is to...sit on the same couch I’ve been sitting on while I wait for them to be done with the shiny thing all week. No talking, just tv. No board game or puzzle to keep us interacting (I have expressed this want directly and it doesn’t happen).   I guess I’m just feeling sorry for myself. We live far away from family, and my closest friends. I don’t want to bother them with this woe is me. But I’m sad. I hate getting picked last all the time in my own relationship, but not in a ‘valid’, ‘they’re cheating’ way. Just the slow, methodical separation that adhd causes.
