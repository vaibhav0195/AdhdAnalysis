f1117bd96b32e3ae2e45d2596eccdeeb55a797b677baa8605a9c670ae326a684;;;Hyperfocus Question;;;My partner (NDX) has typical ADHD inattentive qualities. It drives me nuts-typical issues of feeling neglected, etc. Iâ€™ve stopped trying to compete with whatever hobby heâ€™s focusing on. I just donâ€™t waste my time anymore. Hereâ€™s my question. Iâ€™ve watched countless videos, listened to numerous podcasts and read tons of text trying to figure out the wiring of a ADHD affected brain. The advice is to not take it personally, that it canâ€™t be helped, that they just canâ€™t focus on what doesnâ€™t interest them and thatâ€™s that.   So if they are tuning you out, how are you not supposed to take that personally?  ðŸ¤”
