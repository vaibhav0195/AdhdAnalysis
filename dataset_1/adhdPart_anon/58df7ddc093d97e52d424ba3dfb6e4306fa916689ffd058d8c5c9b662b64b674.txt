58df7ddc093d97e52d424ba3dfb6e4306fa916689ffd058d8c5c9b662b64b674;;;ADHD and Empathy;;;I was wondering if there was a link between the two, if lack of empathy or difficulty putting yourself in another’s shoes is a symptom of ADHD. I fully recognize that it’s likely just another quirk of my husbands but I have long wondered how many of my husbands separate issues are due to his ADHD. (Like his lack of brain to mouth filter and financial irresponsibilities).  To be clear, he does understand that other people have feelings and all that. He’s not a psychopath. He just can’t seem to understand why people feel things when it is not something that he himself feels.   The best example i have is a couple years ago a tree fell onto my dads boat which was being stored for the winter. We got a video from my mom showing the damage and you could hear my dad yelling and swearing in the background. My husband turned to me and asked why my dad was so angry. I admit I thought he was joking.  Me: “A tree just broke his boat, of course he’s angry”  Husband “But it’s just a tree, it’s an act of god. It’s not like someone cut the tree to make it fall this way. I don’t understand why he’s angry.”  And he genuinely didn’t get it. So I asked him how he would feel if we had an earthquake and his super heavy tool kit fell from the trunk it’s on and landed on his violin case, crushing the instrument inside. It’s an act of god, no one broke your violin. How would you feel?  It was like a light went off in his head and he nodded and said “I’d be really pissed off, ok I think I get it. “  So he can empathize with people but only if it’s something that he himself has experienced. I just don’t know if this is a part of his ADHD and can be worked on with therapy or if it’s a part of who he is.   I’m really interested to hear if anyone else has a partner with similar issues and advice on how to work with it. I’m a very empathetic person and it’s very difficult communicating with him sometimes.
