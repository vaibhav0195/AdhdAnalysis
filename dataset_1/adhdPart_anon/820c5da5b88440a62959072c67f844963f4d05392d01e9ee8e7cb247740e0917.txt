We’ve worked through a lot of hard things but sleep is really killing us. He refuses to follow any sleep hygiene advice, consistently claiming “nothing works” for him. In the mornings I’m up first, he snoozes for anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours. Some days he’s asleep the entire time. Some days he’s talking to me but an hour later he can’t remember the conversation. Am I the problem? Do I need to just let this go? I try to encourage him to do the bare basics - waking up and falling asleep at the same time each day, not playing video games in bed, etc, but it seems like I’m fighting a losing battle and I don’t know what to do anymore.
