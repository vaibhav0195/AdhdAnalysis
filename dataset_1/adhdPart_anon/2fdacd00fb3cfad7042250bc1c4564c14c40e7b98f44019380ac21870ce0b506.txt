I'm not great at dealing with it when things deviate substantially from my plans, but he's completely unfazed by such setbacks (and really good at correcting from them) because he's had so much practice with his own plans getting derailed by ADHD behaviors.   I also appreciate the way his rapid context switching lets him scan hundreds of news articles, and he passes along the ones that he thinks will interest me, so I get to find out about cool stuff I might never have discovered otherwise. He can skim a huge volume of information without getting stuck in it, because his attention moves on so easily to the next thing, whereas I tend to try to read one article at a time and thus don't expose myself to nearly as many.
