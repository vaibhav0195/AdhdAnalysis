That mindset seems self-defeating. How can you ever grow or improve if you simply “can’t”? Maybe I am just being a naive little neurotypical, but I believe in the brain’s plasticity and ability to change.  My issue is really that whenever I try to talk to my partner about something she is struggling with in an attempt to find some way to help manage or strategize, she deflects and avoids. Just today we were talking about getting up in the morning and how she “will just go back to sleep” if I don’t turn on enough lights. Her language and tone are just so 100% positive that she will fail at getting herself up. I just wish she could shift her tone more towards, “ADHD makes it harder for me to do some things”. I worry that her ADHD diagnosis has given her an excuse to stop trying. As if she has reasoned that, “Oh I guess I have no control since ADHD is behind the wheel and I’m just along for the ride.”  Am I silly for wanting her to fight for herself more?
