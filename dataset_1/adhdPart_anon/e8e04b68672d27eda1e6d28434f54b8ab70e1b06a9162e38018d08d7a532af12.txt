It took him losing his job, failing out of college, and our separation/impending divorce for him to finally realize that he needs to treat his ADHD.   He was diagnosed initially as a child, but comes from a narc family and his parents refused to let him be treated. We both have a lot of anger towards his parents as he is incredibly intelligent and his life now would be so different if they had just started treatment for him as a child.   He is finally on medication. We’ve struggled to get him consistent therapy-he doesn’t have a therapist right now and is sometimes resistant to the idea. Any help in getting him to see that consistent therapy is crucial?   Likewise, his ADHD created major anger and resentments in me for the years of our relationship where I had to nag him to do anything at all. I have always felt very lonely in our marriage. He ruined his credit, forgot to pay bills, wracked up debts and has collections out, etc.   He is trying, but I still do the majority of the emotional and mental labor in our relationship. I’m tired, really, really tired. Coupled with other issues in our relationship, I’m ready to throw in the towel. I guess I’m asking if it’s even possible for him to improve? Can he get to a point where he can function as an independent adult? I can’t do this for the rest of my life.
