f0ef87596dfbeffcdcfec2d70a536e2323c9e32c83709cdbfcc1d92b25c4bbb6;;;Forgot to lock car door and we got robbed!;;;Soo.. we arrived in Paris yesterday and this morning checked out this morning to carry on with our journey, packed the car up and then went to get some breakfast to take with us. We were gonna leave the puppy in the car but i decided against as I don't trust paris or anywhere with my dog in the car.   Anyway, got our breakfast and returned to car, it appeared to be messy I couldn't understand and then it hit me I asked my partner (male ADHD) to check for ipad...gone! Wallets, cards, weed ( my partner is not medicated and he uses weed as dopamine boost which I have to say is a godsend and without it he would struggle with moods, tantrums much more)   I'm gutted as my partner never locked the door, he always forgets and I didn't remind him today as I was busy organising the wee puppy when we left the car.   So now I'm im paris with the puppy on my own while he travels all the way back to uk to get some money as we have no cards, also he needs some weed other wise the holiday will be a nightmare with his moods and argumentive behaviour.   I'm kinda just venting and upset because stuff like this happens all the time and its super stressful. I feel really sorry for him too as I know he feels like shite because of it, he really wanted to make our anniversary special he even got me a room lookng out to the eiffel tower and had roses and champagne in the room for me.   I think I'm more empathetic than angry. But it still hard when thing's always go wrong. Imagine we did leave the dog for 5mins, she would have been gone too. However, I think I would of checked if the door was locked if she was in it. Anyway, never leave the dog in a car is probably better.
