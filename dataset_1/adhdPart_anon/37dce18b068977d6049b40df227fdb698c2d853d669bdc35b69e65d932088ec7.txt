He is in his mid twenties and not medicated as he reacted poorly to attempts at it.  He is impulsive to an incredibly dangerous degree. We were sitting, cleaning up dinner. I had lit some candles. We have a spray bottle of alcohol for sanitizing things (covid), and I turn around to him *spraying it over the candles to make a fireball*. Thank God it didn't light anything on fire in our dining room.  Tonight he called me while driving home. We were talking and he suddenly said "shit, I got distracted and just blew through a red light. Of course there was a cop", so now we have to pay for a sudden ticket we can't afford.  Driving with him is terrifying because he constantly gets distracted. He'll change lanes or turn off the highway almost at random because of distractions. He'll start speeding up if he's talking about something passionate or listening to a tense podcast and not even notice.  I'm terrified for him, and increasingly for myself. He goes to therapy every two weeks but after months there's no improvement. Is there any direction I can point him in to getting meaningful help?
