Mess and clutter was not tolerated and if there was a little bit, you were called out on it fast. As a result of this, I’m a fairly clean person. My adhd dx partner seems to have a hard time with cleaning keeping things fairly tidy. I know it’s not his fault but it drives me crazy.   He will put fast food wrappers under the sink and on the kitchen top instead of in the garbage, and if the garbage is full, he will wrap it up and toss it to the side instead of where it’s supposed to go, I do all the cleaning in the kitchen because there’s only so many days I can go seeing his mess. I’m careful with my tone. I never yell or get angry about messes. I usually casually say something along the lines of “hey, when your done (with your gaming round) can you please help with picking up your clothes on the ground” and if he’s in a good mood he’ll say yes but if not, he’ll ask why I’m always bitching about messes and stuff.   What pushes me to the edge is when he uses my pc in my office (which is very clean since it’s my space alone) and leaves his papers and his stuff all around it.    It makes me feel like we’re incompatible because I can’t imagine having kids with this man and dealing with x3 of the mess with what feels like myself. I know this is a bit of a rant, but does it get better??
