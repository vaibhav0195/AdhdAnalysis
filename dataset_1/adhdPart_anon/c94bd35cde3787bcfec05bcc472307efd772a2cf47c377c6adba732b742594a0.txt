That’s not me bragging, that’s just things I need to know for work. Problems that I experience literally all the time. From my username you can guess that I’m very familiar with how things work at the airport, especially with how my company operates at my home airport. My partner needed to second guess every choice I made with getting her on the airplane today. It blew my mind that she would doubt that I knew what I was talking about.   This just made me wonder, many of you must be experts in your fields or work. Does your partner do that too?
c94bd35cde3787bcfec05bcc472307efd772a2cf47c377c6adba732b742594a0;;;How many of you have a female ADHD partner?;;;I joined this sub a long time ago and only occasionally read though it. I can sympathize with a lot of you in here and your struggles with your partner. But I’m not seeing a whole lot of people who have a female AHDH partner. I know it’s under diagnosed in women and even then it’s hard for most of them to accept. But the behaviors are so different I’m finding it hard to get much information or  resources on the topic.  We were having a lot of problems before Covid and only starting to work on looking for a new marriage counselor (we have had 3 different ones, the first two didn’t pick up on it and the third had zero idea how to handle any sort of therapy and was just charging us for what felt like essentially talking to your moms friend who took a psych course in college). Now marriage counseling is almost impossible to find and those that have any background in ADHD are solidly booked. We have been on a waiting list for 5 months now.  Idk. I’m just looking for some support and that’s probably why I’m posting here. Any advice?

She was diagnosed as a teen and refuses to believe that she has it. She blames it on her neglected upbringing. Admittedly, she was very neglected. There’s a lot of trauma from her childhood that she refuses to deal with. But I know her father. There is no way he would ever be able to talk a doctor into giving a fake diagnosis like that. And at the time, a girl being diagnosed was almost unheard of. When I bring up that she probably does have it and that we should address it. She completely shuts down and refuses to even talk about. She said it hurt her that I would think that about her   My response was ‘get over it, that’s what you tell me to do’ She brought it up that I would told her that 6 weeks ago, it was two but that’s not the point.   I feel bad about telling her that. But also, I meant it.  I don’t want to play by different rules that I have to just deal with her lack of impulse control, and her neglectfully meandering though life. While I pick up the pieces behind her.   What have you said you feel about about but it was true.

But I’m just wondering what are you not allowed to do or have to ease up on. I’m just trying to post something lighter for once. So one funny one venty  I can’t watch YouTube videos explaining new concepts because they’re talking down to her.   I can’t point out repeatedly forgotten tasks like leaving lights on or not starting the dishwasher
