563bbf4f574cf225e008b50b092debc25e557a3ec497194bfeabd11047751e45;;;I need help communicating that I can’t listen to my SO talk constantly;;;I hope I don’t come off as too much of an awful person here, but my SO who is diagnosed and medicated talks from the moment that he wakes up to the moment that he falls asleep.  He’s not talking to me but more at me, and it’s about a range of topics that he read about online and found interesting.  It’s getting to the point that it hurts to hear him talk. I can’t respond to emails, read cooking directions, or silently pay attention to anything while he is in the room without him talking at me.   The problem is that he finds it hypocritical when I ask for some “quiet time” at home but then start talking to him about things like cleaning, planning ahead for joint activities, reminders about things, etc.   How can I communicate the difference between him talking at me instead of to me (sometimes he’ll ask a question but then barrel on over me and thinks that it’s a conversation...), and explain that sometimes I don’t have the bandwidth to engage with his one-sided stream on consciousness but at the same time need to talk to him about adult things?   I dread him waking up or him coming home because regardless of what I’m doing he just starts talking at me.  If I ignore him and keep doing what I’m doing he gets upset and asks if I’m listening and then continues.  It’s starting to drive me crazy, and I’ve noticed myself subconsciously start to avoid him.
