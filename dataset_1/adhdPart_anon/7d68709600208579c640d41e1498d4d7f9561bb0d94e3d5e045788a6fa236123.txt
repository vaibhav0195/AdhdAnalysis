But have you ever seen your ADHD spouse do something you know they've done at a job and probably resulted in discipline or firing? I just did the other day and I feel like I got a window into what happens.  I asked my spouse to run some errands for me since he's not working and I'm working at home full time. I gave him a pile of returns, some to the post office, and some to a store. When I went into the living room after working all day, I found two of the return items still sitting there even though I knew he'd come back. I asked him why those were still there. It turns out that he packed the completely wrong things and mixed up the returns.  He sort of froze instead of answering me, then hopped on his phone to retrace his steps and (I think) re-read my text to him with instructions. I heard him try to call the post office to see if the package could be stopped (no), and I got hold of the warehouse that would receive the wrong package as well as the intended recipient to tell them there had been a mistake. I had never seen him make such a huge, easily avoided mistake before that touched so many other areas and people. He was laid off months ago after making, he said, some stupid mistakes. I think this is probably what it was. Just not paying attention at all, not double checking instructions, and messing up royal.  He's made similar mistakes that were easily fixed (by me), wrote his birthday instead of today's date on documents that I caught and changed without telling him, things like that. And now I have a whole other level of anxiety when it's time for him to go back to work...
