This may be useful to those of you with medicated partners, and it may even provide explanations or answers to things you didn’t know you wanted the answer for.    **What happens when you stop drinking enough?**  In short, you become dehydrated and will experience symptoms such as feeling tired or dizzy. The symptoms increase in severity the more dehydrated you become, eventually resulting in fits and seizures. Symptoms that might sound familiar, based on the posts in this sub, are increased irritability, confusion, lethargy and poor sleep.   Normally you would experience feeling thirsty before you experience any symptoms of dehydration. However, some people might forget to drink periodically until they begin to feel mild symptoms of dehydration, such as a dry mouth, before they remember to drink something. This especially prevalent for those people diagnosed with inattentive type ADHD for example.   **ADHD Medication**  ADHD medication is designed to alleviate the symptoms of ADHD, generally aimed at improving attentiveness. A side effect of this is that those people taking ADHD medication become less distractible or impulsive, meaning they may not allow the feeling of thirst, hunger, or the need to go to the bathroom, distract them from their current task. Meaning they will reduce their rate of water intake, possibly completely unaware of their increasingly severe symptoms of dehydration.  Some ADHD medications also act as a diuretic, reducing production of the hormone, Vasopressin, that would normally tell the kidneys to reabsorb water rather than allow it to flush through to the bladder. This results in a greater rate of water loss for those people taking ADHD medication, putting them at increased risk of dehydration.  **The knock on effect**  Most commonly prescribed stimulant medications used for treating ADHD are designed to release their dose over an extended period of time. If you aren’t sure what type your partner is taking, the following is a list of some common brands of prolonged release stimulant medication:   · *Concerta Xl*  · *Adderal XR*  · *Ritalin LA*  · *Daytrana*  · *Focalin XR*  · *Quillivant XR*  · *Vyvanse*  · *Metadate CD*  In general, these medications are designed to release their dose over 6 to 12 hours, however, due to how these interact with the body, the durations specified by the manufacturer will vary between patients. Each manufacturer will have their own, often patented, mechanism for how each drug achieves the prolonged release. Unless the drug is administered by anything other than orally, they generally rely on the mechanism of ***Osmosis*** and ***Diffusion*** to function.  The drugs “payload” will be released as it passes through the digestive tract. [Osmosis](https://o.quizlet.com/6exhTo-2j7S8be7v57NQgw_b.png), in this instance, is the movement of water, through a semi-permeable membrane (the drugs capsule), from a low concentration solution (the digestive tract), to a higher concentration solution (inside the drug capsule).   [Diffusion](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Diffusion.svg) on the other hand, is the movement of molecules in solution, moving from an area of high concentration *(inside the drug*) to a an area of lower concentration (*outside the drug*).   Using [Concerta](https://drgrcevich.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/concerta.png) as an example to help explain:  1. The tablet is designed to allow water to enter the capsule via ***Osmosis.***  2. The drug contained within the capsule then dissolves into the water creating a concentrated solution  3. The drug then ***diffuses*** across the semi-permeable membrane to outside the capsule, in this case, the digestive tract.  **But what does remembering to drink periodically have anything to do with it?**  Molecules have no mind of their own and don’t know that they need to be exiting the drug capsule at a constant rate. Instead they rely on the difference in concentrations between the solutions inside the capsule, and outside the capsule, to control the rate at which the drug is released.   If you are not regularly taking on fluids, the amount of water in the digestive tract will decrease. This effectively *increases* the concentration of the solution outside the drug capsule. This has a detrimental impact on the equilibrium between the two environments and results in a lower rate of release from the drug.   ***Therefore*** you won’t be receiving the dose you should be, reducing the effectiveness of the medication.  **Neglecting hydration**   It should be noted that the blood stream and the digestive tract work the same way. The intestine is essentially a capsule containing molecules that must diffuse across the membrane of the intestine and into the blood stream. Whilst this is aided by [active transport/facilitated diffusion](http://www.phschool.com/science/biology_place/biocoach/biomembrane1/glucose.html), it relies heavily on diffusion as well.  You may notice your partner regularly neglects or forgets to maintain a healthy level of hydration (*and this also applies to short acting medications)*, only to later realise and drink a large amount of water because they “are really thirsty”… (sound familiar?) By suddenly introducing more water in to the digestive tract, you are diluting the solution and reducing the concentration of the drug in the digestive tract.   As a result, it is possible the concentration of the drug within your blood stream may eventually equal, or exceed, that of the concentration within the digestive tract. This means the drug in the digestive tract has nowhere to go because both solutions are of equal concentration.   In extreme cases of dehydration, molecules start moving from the blood stream back in to the digestive tract even though you are drinking and trying to rehydrate. If this is the case, I would expect you to be in A&E and taking some form of oral rehydration solution.   **Tips for ADHDers to help remember to drink**  We all know reminders don’t work, nor do apps designed to keep track of your water consumption. Visual reminders work best so here goes:  1. Get yourself a clear water bottle that you know the volume of, and keep it at your workstation. The visual reminder of a bottle full of water should provide a visual reminder to drink. *Hint: most bottles will be around* *500ml/1pint or 1 litre/2 pints. Go for a bigger one if refilling it is too much effort.*  2. Find out how much you *should* be drinking each day and aim for that. *ToolTip:* [*Here is a calculator that does it for you.*](https://www.hydrationforhealth.com/en/hydration-tools/hydration-calculator/)  3. Set yourself a goal to drink half of that amount by lunch time, and again by bed time. Using the number of bottles it takes to make up the volume. ***PRO-Tip (Pros only): Get yourself one of*** [***these***](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Water-Bottle-Straw-Hydrate-Motivational/dp/B071GNKBV8/ref=asc_df_B071GNKBV8/?tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=214318306971&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=3454650125099271383&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1006598&hvtargid=pla-625646246632&psc=1) ***and hit two birds with one stone!***   **Thanks for reading, happy to answer any questions you might have in the comments.**   *Source: BSc Biochemistry and MSc Chemistry at University of Leeds.
