d8842ededaea78a77ab571c4aa6c4b95b7e706c82634f38e98f8f687ddd013d1;;;I'm really proud of myself;;;My partner (ADD, unmedicated) and I were (trying to) discussing an issue. I disagreed with his approach, and was trying to explain my reasoning and research. Little did I know, he was in no place to entertain a cerebral discussion. Out of nowhere, he became super angry and frustrated. I just left him alone because it was clear that he didn't have the bandwidth for that kind of interaction at that time.  I am finally able to see his (very infrequent) blow-ups as an ADD issue. I gave him space, and he calmed down and we proceeded to have a normal day. I'm proud of myself for not trying to force resolution, recognizing that he needed some space to self-regulate, and not taking it personally. And I'm proud of him for getting back to resolving the issue and eventually fixing the problem on his own.
