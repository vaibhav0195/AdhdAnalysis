How do you deal with self sabotage, especially when it ends up impacting both people in the relationship? I have tried- unsuccessfully- to help my spouse in a few different situations to avoid outcomes that would be detrimental both to her individually and to us as a couple. My efforts to help are rebuffed, she doesn’t do what she needs to do to avert crisis even when she has verbalized ahead of time what the consequences could be, and then inevitably ends up in a crisis situation that is ultimately of her own doing. This cycle is maddening. I end up having to rescue her because the situations she gets in impact us both. Then I’m told, more or less, that she doesn’t mean to put me in this situation and she’s not asking me to rescue her, which feels both untrue and extremely naive. I can’t stand living like this, floating from crisis to crisis, because she won’t take care of herself. I feel like I’m always waiting for the other shoe to drop. It also feels really hard for me to be a shoulder to cry on for her when the shit hits the fan, after she’s expressed worry that would happen, I’ve offered solutions, she has rejected the solutions and doesn’t come up with any of her own, and then gets sad when the shit actually does hit the fan.
