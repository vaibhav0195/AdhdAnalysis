I love my partner but there was over a year and a half period where I felt like his mom.  I turned from the relaxed and fun person I was to nitpicky and frustrated. It's gotten better in the last few months so maybe I will feel differently if things stay this way for a while. He is now accepting of his ADHD and wants to get diagnosed, but is still reluctant to consider meds. I'm letting him take his time and not pushing him.   We want to have the "kids" conversation but I don't know what to say. The chances of us having kids with ADHD would probably quite high, and on top of a forgetful partner, I am afraid to be the only responsible adult taking care of the household.  I think he wants kids but doesn't see all of the work, he only thinks about the fun aspects. I have thought about adoption and I was basically adopted, but I always envisioned it with someone I could rely on a bit more. Even when he tries his best I have to double check everything because half the time it isn't done. I don't know how to bring up these concerns with him without making him feel terrible.
