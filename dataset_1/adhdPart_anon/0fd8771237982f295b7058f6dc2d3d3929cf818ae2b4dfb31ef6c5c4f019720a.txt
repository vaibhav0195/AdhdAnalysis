So I’m asking here, as a recently diagnosed Inattentive ADHD male in his 50s, because maybe there are people like me after all.  I’ve been with my partner for over two years. She was the one who suggested that I might have ADHD when I was suffering from severe anxiety. She put up with some severe craziness from me and always picked up the pieces and helped me through. I couldn’t possibly love her more.  So here’s the thing: it’s now her turn to expect something from me. She has a crazy workload at the moment and she can’t even delegate or take time off as she’s the only one able to do what she does. Needless to say, she’s stressed. Breaking down crying, unable to eat, visibly shaking stressed. She needs me to step up... and I want to... but I’m failing. I can’t seem to find a way to be there in any effective way for her. I’ve still got all my chaotic stuff going on: lost my job, industrial tribunal, ex threatening me with suicide because I don’t have money for maintenance, but I need to put that aside and be there for her like she’s always been for me.  I try but I don’t do a very good job of it and I feel like hiding myself away rather than deal with her pain. I feel like a little child. It frustrates me that I lack the toolset to help her. She thinks I don’t give a damn about her because I’m not doing enough to help. If only she knew how much I was trying. It must be agony for her to want someone to ease the pain yet watch them fail and sometimes make it worse.  So my question is, since nothing seems to be geared toward helping the person without ADHD, are there any techniques out there to help? We’re both so lost right now.
