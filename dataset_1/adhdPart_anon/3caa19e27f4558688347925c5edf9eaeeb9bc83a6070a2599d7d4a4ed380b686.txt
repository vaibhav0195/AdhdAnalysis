Getting it is more than just acknowledging their ADHD or breaking free from denial.  Getting it is saying "I have ADHD and it makes \_\_\_\_\_ harder, but not impossible. I'm going to continue to seek out solutions and new ways of doing things until I find something that works"  It is **not** "I have ADHD and it makes \_\_\_\_\_ impossible. Everyone just needs to give me a break and realize this is just the way I am"  It's "I tried a medication and it didn't work well for me. I'm going to keep trying different options until I find a good match"  **Not** "I had a bad experience with medication so I'm never trying one ever again"  It's " \_\_\_\_\_ (activity) isn't very stimulating for me so I'm going to utilize different tools to help me stay focused"  **Not** "\_\_\_\_\_ (activity) isn't very stimulating for me so I'm not doing it."  Some will never get it. Some will wallow in defeatism and learned helplessness for the rest of their lives. And nothing you say or do will change this attitude. All you can do is set boundaries and know when it's time to walk away.  So, when struggling to determine the longevity of an ADHD relationship you can ask yourself "Do they get it?" And if they don't, how long are you willing to wait around in the hopes that someday they will.

But it can also be a reminder of the loneliness we all feel from time to time.  So today I wanted to say thank you.  Thank you for everything you do for your partners  Thank you for sticking by them during times when it would have been easier to walk away  Thank you for all of the accommodations, considerations, and daily emotional labor spent making their lives a little bit easier  You may never hear these things from your own partner. But I'd be willing to bet a fair number of them are so grateful to have your support.  And if they're not, well, maybe you can start turning that love inward. Celebrate yourself today and appreciate yourself. It takes a special sort of person to weather challenges like this and I'm so glad we have a space where we can all come together and grow.  Happy Valentine's Day
