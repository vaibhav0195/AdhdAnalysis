My brothers were all very sexist and put ALL the chores on me. My nuclear family consist of 6 people and we were all SLOBS. It was horrific and very stress inducing to be the one blamed for it all.   Anyway, I've been with my partner for 2 years now. We moved in together, living together around 1 year. His inability to clean was a point of contention, and we have argued about it a LOT. He agreed I was doing a majority of the chores/food shopping and whatever else, and tried to work on doing chores daily.   He has significantly improved, and I'm so thankful for all the effort hes putting into this. Esspecially because hes not medicated right now, so it's all on him to find ways to remember. Even though it's been getting better, I still do a fair amount more. I know it's not a sexist thing, but sometimes it feels that way bc of my childhood. It makes me so angry, moreso than doing more of the chores.   I'm moreso venting bc I dont want to discourage him when hes improving. Anyone else perceive the chore imbalance as sexist even though you KNOW it's due to ADHD?
