I recently found this sub and honestly the support and conversation has been really helpful. First time posting and on mobile so please forgive any formatting!  Basically, my partner and I have been together for 4.5 years, known each other for almost 9. We're also really really good friends on top of our relationship. One thing we've struggled with though is intimacy. He has quite severe adhd, and he gets very overloaded when it comes to physical sensation. This is not just sex, but touching, hugging, even when it comes to fabrics it needs to be a certain feel to it or else he gets extremely agitated and distressed.   This has impacted our sex life, and it's honestly left me feeling lonely and insecure. I know this isn't his fault, and I want to be compassionate. I want to work through this with him, but I'm not sure where to start. I was wondering has anyone else gone through this?   Thank you for reading!
