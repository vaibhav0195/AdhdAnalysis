f1662b0931108372257147fd4a40aaa11e1f67b5b25133997cc03abc7118105c;;;But ADHD...;;;Husband believes his disrespect and anger issues are ok, because he has ADHD.  That I should know he didn't mean it that way. He can't focus. That he's frustrated. Sure.  So that gives you the right to be a complete jackass?   Tell me to shut up and fucking listen. Tell our son quit crying after you made him feel stupid.  I'm fucking exhausted!   If I acted this way I'd have an ear full but he has ADHD so everything is to just be swept under the rug and get over it.  Telling an adult they need to adult is impossible.
