2593ab47307ea6c4b22914d90a66e6151964ca3fafcbb17698b71a455dee6c99;;;Wife of ADD Husband;;;I have been married for 13 years. My husband is in therapy for a few years to teach him  skills after learning he has ADD. Anybody married to a spouse with add/adhd can relate how stressful being married to someone with add/adhd can be and the toll it takes on their relationship. I went from being a happy go lucky to the nagging, stressed, moody, anxious, withdrawn  person. I had to pick up all the pieces when he just couldn’t. He recently told me that he thinks that I should go speak to a therapist because he thinks that I have problems. He said that I have these weird mood swings etc...suggesting that maybe I have some type of personality disorder? I seriously couldn’t believe my ears. After years of waiting and hoping that he will get better..putting up with all his add behaviors he thinks that I have the problems? Does anybody else’s spouse with add/adhd also not recognize or realize the effect that their add/adhd can have on their spouse? Does anybody else that has a spouse with add/adhd think that they are the problem?
