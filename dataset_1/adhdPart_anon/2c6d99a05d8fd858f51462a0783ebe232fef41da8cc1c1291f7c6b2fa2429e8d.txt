2c6d99a05d8fd858f51462a0783ebe232fef41da8cc1c1291f7c6b2fa2429e8d;;;I'm new here.;;;And I just found this sub. I found it after I searched "married but live apart". My husband is dx. But only for a year. And we've been together for ten. This sub is my life in a bunch of brilliantly worded comments and posts. I tired, I'm resentful, I don't have room for guilt anymore. And I'm done. The many many times I've tried to write a post on relationship advice or explain it to him, I have failed because I thought I was alone and being petty for being angry that I am "responsible for everything". Idk where to go from here. But I know I'm going to read every thing on here because finally someone gets me.
