I was fuming, and rushed back to shop to fix it before the business hours were up.   While in the shop and in the middle of fixing this embarrassing mess, my husband's brother (who is the best man and lives in a different country, also with adhd) calls me up to tell me his passport expired. His 13 hour flight is first thing the next day. Wedding is the day after.   I call a few people and the airport about this issue, to no avail. Get a phone call back from BIL an hour later, saying he read the wrong date on his passport (date of issue, not date of expiry). So he's all packed and checked in on the flight.   Luckily, I was able to get married instead of committing double murders.
