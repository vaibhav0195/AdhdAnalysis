5b9b8708f2c5ccae36a89b2fd812e2c2f16b664da691dd0e049e254033c7db33;;;Glimpses of ‘normal’ life;;;Does anyone else’s partner just randomly have all their neurons line up or whatever and you get random bouts where your spouses ADHD seems non existent? Like my husband will randomly just be super helpful around the house or spend the day making ‘his’ room (it’s the guest room but he’s taken it over with his firefighter stuff and his computer set up) look nice, or the other day he went to the store, got all the makings for dinner, sent me into a room to relax after work, while he made dinner and poured me a glass of wine. He’s unmediated so these sort of things only happen like once every 2 weeks unless he’s really stressed out. But it’s nice to forget he has ADHD for a bit and have him contributing to the household
