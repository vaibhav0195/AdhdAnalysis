Vacuum, garbage (when remembered), recycling (when remembered), yard (when it's gotten to) are the household tasks my (dx) husband and his brother who livea with us share.  I hate vacuuming and now we have a dog and cat... As you guessed, vacuuming never gets done... So I bought myself a roomba. I saw it at Costco for $80 off and got it. It will make me happy and hubby happy! Totally worth it.
