6bc257df988574c3ac21eb9a43e8dc8aaf1db028ab45bfa2c2673d38be9f8488;;;I feel like I have to learn to not trust my partner’s words to not feel disappointed;;;My partner (DX) often says things like “we can talk/call/etc. soon” and that soon doesn’t usually mean soon. In fact, sometimes it just never happens ever.   As the title says, I feel like I have to just not trust them when they say “soon” or “in a bit” or any related phrase.   I have been working towards not taking it personally when I feel forgotten or ignored, but it’s making me sad that now I feel like I can’t trust what my partner is saying. I don’t want to continue feeling like this, but I don’t know how else to feel so that I can also protect myself and not continuously feel disappointed or forgotten.
