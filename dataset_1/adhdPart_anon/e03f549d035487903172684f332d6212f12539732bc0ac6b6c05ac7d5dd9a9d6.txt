He working really really hard to make changes to help but I know I have some work to do also to get out of this role. I want to acknowledge his effort by putting effort in as well (not that this whole marriage has not required effort).  Does anyone have any books, videos, articles that helped them get past this dynamic? Bonus points if it helps with the sexual intimacy issues that come with this.
