If he wants to do something that I have set boundaries around, there's always some justification or excuse for why he did the thing anyways. When asked, he says he thinks about my perspective, but he "didnt think it would be harmful" and "I didn't mean to hurt you." Which I completely believe, I dont think it's gaslighting at all, but if I try to generalize this as an issue I'm told I need to think more about the details and reasons why he does things and that it isn't indicative of a slippery slope for distrustful behavior. I have pretty bad anxiety this is making it worse. I know impulse control and adhd can go pretty hand in hand, but I don't know how to handle this because the upset and frustration is growing on my end. How do you handle impulse control? Or breakdowns on trust and boundaries as a result thereof? I love him and want to make this work but I'm really struggling
