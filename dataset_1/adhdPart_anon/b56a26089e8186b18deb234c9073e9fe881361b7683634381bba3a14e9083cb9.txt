They say that they can never get a word in edgewise, that “everyone we know just wants to hear themselves talk”. Yet what I observe is that they don’t actually listen to anyone and jump in and interrupt constantly. And when they try to tell a story it goes on way too long, with no clear arc, and unnecessary sidetracks. Folks glaze over. For the record, we have great, highly emotional intelligent folks in our sphere. I don’t think they are overtaking the conversation.  I just avoid social situations with my partner now, and with COVID-19 it’s been easier to do. But when I take a risk and have one or two folks over I have to hear afterwards how victimized my partner feels over being unheard, and of course i walk on eggshells worried they are going to say something rude or thoughtless.   Anyone else have this issue? I hate how isolated and avoidant I am of being social now. It’s leading to depression, and yeah- I could go do stuff alone, and I do. But that feels even more depressing when I want a PARTNER in this life.
