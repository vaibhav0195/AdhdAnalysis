That’s a big deal because he goes from one place straight to work every Tuesday. He had to run home in a panic last week.   This morning, he was leaving and said goodbye and was like “I remembered my boots this time!”   Later I saw his lunch bag, full of food, on the floor, where his boots go. That’s ADHD folks!   Hopefully he will laugh about it once he realizes....

After being diagnosed at 30, I realized a lot of what caused problems was not just immaturity but ADHD symptoms. It’s a year later and I’m still really struggling to accept what it means for our lives. For better or worse right? It’s not his fault. But I didn’t know that this is what it would be like. And not to mention the YEARS of misunderstanding that led to loads of resentment. It’s done a lot of damage. How can I get over the expectations I had of my marriage and move forward? Edit: he won’t go to therapy

I’ve had a really hard few days. I have been extremely stressed and overwhelmed and barely holding it together. I got into an accelerated nursing program that allows me to get my associates and bachelors in nursing at the same time. Yesterday, I realized my FIRST term will cost 6k. The stress of the election. My oldest has been going through some stuff. It’s just been a lot.   My husband works 10hr swings Sunday- Wednesday. So the majority of the week I’m solo for all the kids needs. Practices into the evening. Homework. Dinner. Bath. You get it.   He had the day off today but wanted to help out a Mutal friend by replacing his alternator. No problem! Glad he can help out like that. He was gone from 6am to 6pm. He finished the job early in the day. He never checked in with me to ask if I needed help with the kids and practices and all that. HE KNOWS I’ve been hanging on by a thread. It just felt like such a punch to the gut. He apologized profusely. But I’m so sick of the “I lost track of time”. “I forgot”. “I meant to”.   We have three young kids. One of which isn’t even in Kinder till next year. I start nursing school in January. I’m terrified. I think I will be in school MORE than full time and still the primary parent and adult. I don’t have a support system. No close (involved) family. No really solid friends.   I don’t know how I can accept this kind of behavior. Even if it’s the ADHD and he didn’t “mean” to. And this is a classic example of the straw that broke the camels back. I needed him to be aware. He wasn’t. It all builds over time and then I’m boiling. Everything is even on a shared calendar!!!   I’m so burnt out. And so pissed off. Thank you for reading.
