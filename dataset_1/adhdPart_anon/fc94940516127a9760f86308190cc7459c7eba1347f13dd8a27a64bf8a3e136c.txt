fc94940516127a9760f86308190cc7459c7eba1347f13dd8a27a64bf8a3e136c;;;Partner[DX] got a book & I wanna brag;;;I saw it on his amazon orders - itâ€™s about women & ADHD. He may see this post (hey boo) and I wanted him to know how much that meant to me. His effort to understand me above and beyond makes me tear up, all the people who never bothered to understand me, they just dismissed and punished me when they were supposed to love me. I feel so loved. It feels amazing when someone is willing to do the work to understand you.   We are both diagnosed so this is an even bigger deal as I know how hard reading can be for him. I decided to post because there are plenty of partners, on both sides of the adhd fence, who might benefit from understanding that making the effort to learn, to not take things personally, to try to truly empathize might be the best thing you could do for your relationship.
