Since lockdown and particularly the last 3 months with no job, he's gotten really into them again. Which was great! He was excited and buying and selling responsibly.   Except now it's driving me crazy. Every day. Every conversation. All about trains. I'll be in the middle of a conversation with him regarding dinner or something and he'll start taking about a new train he just found as bargain.   I don't know how to nicely let him know that I don't want to keep hearing about it? It's making me feel like I'm talking to a wall half the time.
