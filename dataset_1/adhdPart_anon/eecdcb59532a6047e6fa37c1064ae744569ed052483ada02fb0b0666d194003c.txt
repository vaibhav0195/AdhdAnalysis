eecdcb59532a6047e6fa37c1064ae744569ed052483ada02fb0b0666d194003c;;;Need advice... am I being unreasonable?;;;After 7 years of being together... my wife has never had a job once, and I’ve always been ok with that cause she was there to watch the kid while I worked full time. Even last year during the lockdowns it was fine cause she was there to homeschool the kid. Now this last year in October we just bought a house and moved to a new area, so her only responsibility is to wake up at 9am to get our kid to school by 9:50 and she can’t even do that. Every day it’s a struggle to get her to be on time, it’s always like arguing with 2 children.   My job is extremely physically demanding, and can have me on the road for a week at a time and during those weeks I work for 5am-8pm. Then I will have a week down with doing work from home (video editing) the week after. When I come home though, my body is broken, sore, tired, and aching, but I still always split the household duties like dishes, laundry, cleaning the house, and most of the time it’s not splitting it, I just do it because I know how overwhelming things can get when you don’t have any backup. I also take on stuff that she doesn’t do at all, like mowing the lawn and taking out the trash, which she would pile like a college kid playing jenga if I didn’t take it out. On top of my normal job and balancing time with my daughter, I am the one who fixes everything around the house when it breaks. When my wife is in a bad mood or tired, I’ll take our kid to playgrounds so she has time to herself, even though I’m the only one who has been working the entire length of our relationship and I could use days like that, I understand the optics of it cause to her it seems like just being away from home is a “rest” even though on those days I’m working nonstop for 10-12 hours, and I’d rather be home spending time with my daughter. All I ever ask is that she wakes up on time to get our daughter to school so she isn’t late, but my wife can’t even do that without me having to call to wake her up, set alarms several alarms, or when I am home I have to nudge her and wake her up like she is a kid. She will say “I’m up,” in a angry tone but I know she wasn’t awake cause I could hear her snoring again 🤦🏻‍♂️ It is like she gets offended when I call her out for falling back to sleep or when I say it’s time to get up.   At this point I’m ready to say screw it and start taking my kid to school on my own, and tell her to get her own place. This way she can actually understand how hard it is being the sole income earner and having to pay all the bills, on top of everything else that goes along with having your own place, and being a working parent. She has no concept of how hard I work, just so that she doesn’t have to work just so we can pay our bills, and all I ever need is for her to take our kid to school on time and spend time with her when I’m on the road for work. But even if I’m only gone for 2 days, she acts like it was the toughest time and is already overwhelmed by the time I get back home. What I don’t understand is why though, our daughter is in school 6 hours out of the day, she gets to bed at 8, so that leaves 4 hours a day that she has to spend time with her, even then it’s maybe 3 cause of dinner and other things. Even when I’m on the road I will have to call just to get our daughter to bed cause my wife would rather be her friend than her parent. Which I get cause it’s a balance, we are our kids first friends and we are also the ones who teach them limits and boundaries through discipline, but again, she doesn’t discipline. Instead she just gets frustrated and gives up so our daughter ends up getting to do what she wants, just without my wife as her best buddy for the time. So, I end up having to be the main one to discipline and balance the way my daughter views me because I don’t want her to think of me as the “bad guy,” since I am the one who has to discipline her for my wife.  If I ever speak up about her being late, forgetting to do stuff or any of the other stuff, she blows up and starts getting very defensive and extremely hostile. I have bipolar, and even I try to keep my calm because I know as soon as I lose my shit, it’s going to get out of hand. But she immediately loses her shit, threw the kids lunchbox at me and starts yelling that I don’t ever have to take our kid to school. All I could think was, she doesn’t ever have to work 15 hour days, get up at 4am to drive 10 hours across country just to work into the night, then still come home to chores around the house, and dealing with a spouse who never had to be a functioning adult on their own. Which doesn’t come out the best way after you’ve had a lunchbox thrown at your head 🥪🤕 After getting our kid to school late almost every day during the week, she just putz around the garden then is in a bad mood when our daughter gets off school. I’m honestly at my end, I don’t know how to deal with it anymore.   My wife is ADD and medicated, I handle the payments for it and got her set up cause she has a tough time scheduling and keeping appointments, so that’s one more thing I have to stay up on and adds outside stress. I NEVER hold this stuff over her head until days like this where she can’t even get our daughter to school on time and goes off the handle when I confront her. I’m tired of it, I’m tired of having to support someone, emotionally and financially, who doesn’t appreciate what they have or how much their partner does to maintain our life. I can’t do it anymore and I don’t know what to do about this, I don’t want to divorce but I also don’t want to live my life supporting someone who doesn’t appreciate what they have, and can’t even get up to take our kid to school on time. She said “I don’t care about being on time,” and I told her she should care about teaching our daughter to be on time, and that it will effect our daughter.   I want to make it very clear that I don’t care about her not working, or that I have to do chores around the house, cause it would be like that regardless if she was here or not. What I am upset about is the fact that she doesn’t appreciate or even recognize everything I do so we can maintain our life. On top of helping her keep things as organized as possible so she doesn’t become buried by the stress that comes with this life. What upsets me most though is that she gets mad when I call her out for making our daughter late 3 out of 5 days a week. All I ever wanted was for her to get used to doing something that was consistent, and regular, so she can get used to a schedule, but no matter what I do to make that load easier for her, she can’t keep up her end.   Am I being unreasonable here? If I am, then please help me figure out a better way to approach this issue... at this point I don’t know what to do anymore
eecdcb59532a6047e6fa37c1064ae744569ed052483ada02fb0b0666d194003c;;;Wife forgot my birthday for 2nd year in a row;;;Recently posted about my wife (31 DX) constantly getting our kid to school late and lack of appreciation for everything I do. I appreciate all your advice and input, it helps to get feedback from people who deal with this issue.   Anyway, last year my wife forgot my birthday and I made a point to talk to her about it after it happened. I explained that it really hurt my feelings and that it’s already so rare for her to show any affection or ever take time to show me I’m special to her, that it hurts even more when she doesn’t even remember my birthday. She promised she would never do that again....  Well here we are a year later and she once again forgot. No happy birthday, no acknowledgment, today is just like any other day. After making a point to tell her about how I felt last year when she forgot, I’m actually really upset about it this year. I don’t expect anything or for her to get me a gift, but I wish she would at least acknowledge that today is my birthday and tried to make it a point to do better than last year.  I’m not sure how I should handle it this time, cause like the other issue of her being late, not showing affection is a recurring issue, and never making time to  show me she cares is something she is severely lacking.   What should I do? Should I confront her again? Do I have a right to even be upset? I know she has ADHD and part of that is being forgetful but this is the 2nd year in a row.... after I already talked to her about it last year... and I even reminded her last week, more than once, that my birthday was coming up...  honestly I don’t know how to handle this
