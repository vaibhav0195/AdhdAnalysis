We’ve been together 3 years and married for 1, and I have always known that he has ADHD. He’s currently on medication and has been for years, but I’ve noticed that regardless if he takes his meds or not it still feels like he has trouble with excessive talking. This may not seem like a big deal, but it makes it very difficult for me to feel connected to him because I feel like he’s always dominating the conversation and when I do get to talk it feels like he is waiting for me to finish talking so that we can go back to talking about his hobbies rather than listen to what I have to say.  He loves cars and is also an engineer so his interest and work overlap-while this is great for him and I am so happy he’s following his passion, it’s often exhausting for me because I feel like all we talk about is cars. I’ve tried my best to take an interest in learning about different cars and supporting his hobby by going to auto cross with him and listening to his plans to modify his car or facts about cars we see on the road, but there always comes a certain point where I just feel like I have nothing to add to the conversation and I just keep saying “mhmm” until he notices that I am losing interest. Even after noticing that I’m not that into the conversation he will tend to keep going and sometimes it feels like he just wants someone to listen or to hear himself talk (but I could just be taking it personally). Bottom line, has anyone experienced anything similar with their partner or have any tips for how to communicate these feelings to my husband?
