I feel like I can't express any less-than-blissful emotions without him immediately getting defensive and angry that I'm "blaming him." I feel like I have to either constantly walk on eggshells around him (which means I have no mental rest in my own home) or else deal with being snapped at and made out to be the bad guy because I sighed wrong.  If it was anyone else, I would think they were doing on purpose as a form of passive-aggressive control.

I'm currently reading the book "Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents" by Lindsay C. Gibson, and while it focuses on parent/child dynamics, the basic description of emotionally immature people seems to fit a lot of the ADHD partners posted about here. I'm wondering, does emotional immaturity masquerade as ADHD, or is it more common for those with ADHD to have a harder time developing emotionally?   I don't have an answer, there would have to be a number of studies done to get any idea, but I'm curious what everyone here thinks.  This was the quote from the book that really struck me: "As a result, their natural style is to promise something, not do it, apologize perfunctorily, and then resent people if they keep bringing it up."
