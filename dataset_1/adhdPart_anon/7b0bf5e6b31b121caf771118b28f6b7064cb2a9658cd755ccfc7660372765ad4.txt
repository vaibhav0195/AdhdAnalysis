The tree has been pulled away from the wall to “decorate” more. There are clothes and shoes of his all over. Things that need to be cleaned all over the kitchen counter. He is off work for a few weeks for the holidays. I  (NT) am still working full time from home and trying to wrap up end of year paperwork. This morning his standard line “I want to be so productive, but I just don’t know what to do...” came out. I gotta tell you, I nearly lost it. I didn’t address it then, and now that I’m calm - he’s found something to do - video games. Ughhhhh. Is it just me? Am I the only one? How does everyone handle this?
