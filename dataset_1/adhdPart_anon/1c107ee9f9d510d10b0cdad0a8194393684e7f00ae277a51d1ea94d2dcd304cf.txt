No it’s not my job, but I can’t just snap my fingers and stop caring about their well being, move on with my life, and shrug my shoulders at the thought of their lives falling apart without anyone to lean on.   Obviously I may be biased because my partner is a good human with no anger issues or negative feelings towards me in any circumstance, but I don’t think any of us care about our partners any less, and that’s why a lot of us don’t leave.   I also wince at the thought of my partner meeting someone who doesn’t understand adhd at all and therefore could become verbally or physically abusive towards them when they make a mistake, because I know they would be too down on themselves to leave. They would just take it because they would feel like they deserve it, and that breaks my heart.   No that’s not my responsibility to worry about, but when you love someone I don’t think you have a choice in your worries anymore.

1c107ee9f9d510d10b0cdad0a8194393684e7f00ae277a51d1ea94d2dcd304cf;;;Does anyone else feel like they’ve forgotten what prolonged interaction with a non ADHD person is like?;;;I think I might be in a unique boat here, but I have no friends in real life and don’t work a traditional job so the only person I speak with every day is my dx partner besides brief phone calls with my parents.   I will occasionally chat with an online friend but they also have adhd and I tend to avoid them because of it even though they are a wonderful friend.   Because of this I find myself pondering about what it would feel like to speak with a non adhd human.. Imagining having a conversation or spending time with someone who would remember what I say and be fully present in the moment seems impossible to me.   Also someone who follows through and is able to be trusted to handle small tasks without guidance or reminders.. that genuinely does not feel real to my brain. I think if I had an interaction like that I might end up bursting into tears.   Does anyone else feel this way? It’s part of the reason I hold back from leaving sometimes. The idea of anyone I pursue not having adhd just seems fully impossible and I love my partner’s personality and our connection too much for the risk to feel worth it.
