I've been married 6 years to a wonderful man(DX ADHD)He was formally diagnosed about a year ago but had troubles due to getting meds(no pharmacy had it for some reason) Basically had to go back every time and get re-diagnosed for a new script. Long story short, we now how a proper DX and meds.  We have 3 kids, two of which are special needs(one Sbs twin and a baby girl with Autism) I myself am most likely on the spectrum but I haven't gotten diagnoses yet. This is not super relevant but shows how hectic our lives are.  So now that we're getting in a better place both of us are making an effort into fixing the problems in our marriage. I'm also a special needs teacher so I've been doing a TON of research on ADHD and what I can do as a spouse to help.  Problem is, the research I am coming up with basically is just how a NT spouse can support their ND partner. Great but not so helpful for him supporting me.  We're going to get into counseling but are currently in the process of fixing broken cylinder heads on our only van. If any of you have done car work you can imagine how daunting lol. After crisis mode is over we will go to counseling.  What are some of the ways that you've found your partners support you? I'm wondering from NT and ND alike.   There is also some emotional damage done from past years(him to me) due to all this so I need to learn to forgive, forget and trust again but that's when I see a counselor myself.
