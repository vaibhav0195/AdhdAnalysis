And it's just been over a year of  being together (we're both 25, he's diagnosed and medicated). I like to think I have extraordinary levels of patience and he acknowledges it too but sometimes I wanna bang my head into a brick wall with the things he does sometimes. I'm so exhausted with being understanding and filling in the blanks all the time with no help. And I'm tired of constantly having to have talks with him because it's starting to sound like nagging to me. Those who have been doing this for years, please tell me how you do it. I could really use some advice and support. I love this man but if I don't find a way to deal with this, I don't know how much longer I can do this.
