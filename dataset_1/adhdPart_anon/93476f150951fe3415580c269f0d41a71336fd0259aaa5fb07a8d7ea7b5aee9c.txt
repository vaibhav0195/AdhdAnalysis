Usually he is loving, attentive, kind, and *actually cares about how his words might affect someone.*  Anyone else feel like those things get thrown out the window when your ADHD SO goes unmedicated?  Especially what I wrote in my title. If he feels slighted even a little, usually over something so small, then he will say whatever just to hurt the other person and feel like he gains control of the convo.  It hurts and I'm crying and I try to give him space but then sometimes I come back and he is still on whatever it is that is making him so angry. And unless I kneel to the floor and kiss his feet, nothing I can say or do makes him "better."  I HATE unmedicated ADHD in my SO. I probably will get downvoted for saying this.  I just needed to rant/vent.

Is this their emotional dysregulation?  It really hurts and I feel alone and don't know how to get over it.   I try to just remember how good he is to me most of the time but that doesn't always help in the moment when I'm in tears.   And then I get blamed for crying and told I have no reason to cry and to stop.  It sucks that he seems to have ZERO self-awareness when he's in this emotional state.
