NT partners desperately want to know if something is "just part of ADHD" and DX individuals want to prevent any negative correlation with their disorder.  The bottom line is - the *WHY* doesn't matter. It is a reasonable expectation to be treated fairly and with consideration to your own health and wellbeing in *every* relationship regardless of contributing factors.  Attempting to draw a hard distinction between these factors is not helpful to anyone. Policing what might or might not be related to ADHD doesn't change the situation many find themselves in with their DX partners.  What does help is providing the community with tools to recognize patterns.  Today's post will explore examples of the more subtle, emotionally/psychologically manipulative behaviors that someone might experience. Many of these are daily interactions that may leave you feeling confused, frustrated and mistreated but struggling to pinpoint why.  https://preview.redd.it/lj5z580hpy761.png?width=529&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e34294ab640298a8d7f1a966cb3389466211bd2  https://preview.redd.it/azmmrywmpy761.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=673ce3f46de3d6c9eaf99fbf23a83a017784a804  https://preview.redd.it/j8r7ghltpy761.png?width=529&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7d4148cf51d5d01bdbb8e10a1f31f87883b1baf  You may be thinking to yourself "well some of these things, like excessive talking or changing the subject, just sound like expected symptoms of ADHD" and that would be true. But again, what we're looking for are patterns and intent. Displaying 1 or 2 of these traits occasionally isn't necessarily a red flag. But using ADHD as an excuse to continue harmful behaviors certainly is. Once you're able to put a name to these interactions it will help you make more informed decisions (preferably with the help of a therapist) on what steps to take moving forward.  I plan to make this a monthly series if time allows but for those who don't wish to wait feel free to browse [Abuse and Relationships.org](https://www.abuseandrelationships.org/index.html) for more examples and support.

We all know that ADHD is an explanation, not an excuse. But many of us struggle to find the line between accommodating legitimate deficits and simply accepting disrespectful behavior.  A few examples of behavior that should never be tolerated might be:  * Violent outbursts * Name calling * Spending time on interests **instead** of time with partner (there has to be balance and compromise, hyperfocus is not an excuse for neglect) * Refusal to consider partner's needs and feelings once they have been clearly addressed * Deflection, projection, gaslighting, lying, triangulation etc * Refusal to implement available self-management tools i.e. timers, clocks, calendars, apps * Refusal of any treatment option ie medication, therapy, coaching, couples counselling and so on  Examples of areas where you could expect to make reasonable accommodations:  * Time management * Forgetfulness * Emotional lability  (note: not an excuse for emotional abuse) * Inattentiveness * Impulsivity   Here is where you decide what you will and will not accept & what your needs in a relationship are  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/u3dkfoz6ej151.png?width=1057&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fb189054ba59bff1956e590ccca3a0989d69dca  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/l3votc3bej151.png?width=1029&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfb4af4ea513231c919e37bf3b80ff4aae04b17a  These excerpts are taken from [CHADD](https://chadd.org/attention-article/dont-give-up-dont-give-in-survival-skills-for-the-non-adhd-partner/) but there are plenty of other resources available on this subject. I think it would be useful for many non-ADHD partners to ask themselves "Would I tolerate this behavior from a neurotypical partner?". And "Why am I willing to tolerate the behavior simply because my partner has ADHD?" Many of us would face similar issues in any other relationship because we have not learned how to advocate for our own needs appropriately. Expectations for being treated with consideration, compassion and respect should not vary so greatly across NT or DX relationships.  If anyone finds this information helpful I may make a follow-up post highlighting what different boundaries can look like as well as learning how your own reactions/responses can be used as a powerful tool for creating the environment you want to have.

Emotions run high in conflicts with our loved ones and it is all too easy to play the blame game and lash out at our partners.   &#x200B;  [As many of us have come to realize - often it's not what you say to your ADHD partner, rather how you say it](https://preview.redd.it/pj7gfnuu2tm31.png?width=1318&format=png&auto=webp&s=63a9d1a466ff1851e255eee2039730b344fa6f4b)  Practicing mindfulness and other DBT skills can improve communication for all parties involved
