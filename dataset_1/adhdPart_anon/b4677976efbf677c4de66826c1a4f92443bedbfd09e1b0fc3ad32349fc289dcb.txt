b4677976efbf677c4de66826c1a4f92443bedbfd09e1b0fc3ad32349fc289dcb;;;Adhd doesnt mean abusive;;;I wish someone had sat me down a long time ago and made me understand this. Just because someone has adhd doesnt mean its okay they forget about you, flip interest back and forth, put themself first, dont help with the relationship, lie, gaslight, acting out in violence, 'accidentially' rape or assault you, devalue you, discard you, project their problems on you, project their apathy on you, just to name a few.  You dont have to take it, because you want to be empathic towards your abusive partner. You dont have to ruin yourself because they dont see you as a separat human being from themselves. You do not have to feel guilty for leaving and finding a partner who is good to you.  All of the above things have nothing to do with adhd, however youve might been told he/she just cant help it. If you have to tell yourself everyday that youre strong enough to take it, then stop, and ask yourself why you dont feel like you deserved to be loved, seen and supported, and then go get help. You might be in a codependent relationship.  There are many many lovely adhd people. This is not to say anything negative about adhd. Only those who use it as an excuse to abuse their partners or spouses.  So many people write on this sub, explaining abusive neglective behaviour like its the norm for a adhd partner. It truly isnt. They are either assholes or misdiagnosed if they continue to do these things.
