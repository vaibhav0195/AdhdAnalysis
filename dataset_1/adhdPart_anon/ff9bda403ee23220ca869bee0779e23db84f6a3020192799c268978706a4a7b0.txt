I was out of town for 2 weeks prior. She was supposed to take the invitations to school and hand them out to the teacher & parents.  She never did.  The day of the party, I discovered this and frantically started calling & texting everyone I knew from her class. Sadly, everyone had other plans. My daughter's party, at a local fun house / bounce place, was just her and her older brother. She was devastated.  My wife has never owned up to this, and insists it was just too stressful to take the things to school and hand them out / follow up with a text to parents.  This is the most insidious part of all these mental challenges to me - the unintended effects on everyone else - including the *really* bad ones.
