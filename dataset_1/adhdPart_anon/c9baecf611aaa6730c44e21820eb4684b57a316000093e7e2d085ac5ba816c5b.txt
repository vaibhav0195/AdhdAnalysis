What seemed like a simple request is in fact fairly complex and us mods have discussed this to see what's reasonable, feasible and in the long run beneficial to this community.  &#x200B;  **To the partners and family members (NT aswell as ADHD) that come here asking for advice about their ADHD loved ones:**You are the core part of this sub, this place is intended to support, validate and provide information to you in the first place. We realise a big part of you have been hurt by your loved ones and have built up  alot of resentment.**Let us remind you that if you want to vent without your concerns and feelings being invalidated, rationalised, dismissed or in any form disrespected;** ***use the Weekly Vent Thread.*****We will keep a very close eye on this to make sure this safe space is respected.**  **If you seek advice and feedback from the community, it will remain an open dialogue between NT and ADHD perspective.** Both sides can add valuable perspective and information and need to be  heard when it's done in a respectful manner and when it comes from a place of understanding and accountability. We would be doing ourselves a disservice to exclude the very people we're talking about. It's a slippery slope to alienating and polarising both sides.Not everyone has the same level of knowledge on this, that's why we're working behind the screens on a more extended [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD_partners/wiki/index). It's a fairly big task, so hang in there as we're sorting through reputable sources and fleshing things out.  &#x200B;  **To the ADHD partners:**Those that contribute with valuable feedback and information, thank you. It's not always easy venturing on this side of the fence. Those of you that have made progress in your relationship and handling of the condition can provide a great help to those that haven't with a unique perspective we as non-ADHD cannot always provide.  Those that find it difficult and feel the need to defend themselves or cause a stir: maybe this isn't the place for you. Keep in mind that the content here **is not a personal attack.** You are all individuals  with a varying combination of symptoms of the same disorder, mixed in with different personality styles. This doesn't mean the concerns displayed here are invalid.“But I can't help it” type of comments will be removed, so basically comments that display not taking responsibility for yourself. Same goes for comments that invalidate an OP's concern just because you as an individual don't portray described behaviour. If you have serious doubts as to why the subject at hand has nothing to do with ADHD, provide resources and arguments.  &#x200B;  This leads us to: **the report button**  This is a very useful tool in maintaining the quality of this sub. Please use it. This sub gets checked multiple times per day so us mods can intervene when necessary. As the report button options might not have been appropriate in the past for the misconduct, we have added a new rule: **no invalidation, no disrespect**. Use it with integrity and try to see the other person's perpective first before reporting.  EDIT: The new rule "**No invalidation, no disrespect**" is to be applied to the following:  *“But I can't help it” type of comments will be removed, so basically comments that display not taking responsibility for yourself. Same goes for comments that invalidate an OP's concern just because you as an individual don't portray described behaviour. If you have serious doubts as to why the subject at hand has nothing to do with ADHD, provide resources and arguments."*  It will not be used on well intended but ill informed advice, as there is a chance to educate the poster and the lurkers on this sub. There is alot if misinformation floating around the internet, so we cannot use this tool to stifle education and debate.  If you have any questions or remarks, let us know in the comments.

Barkley: The Importance of Emotion in Understanding and Managing ADHD;;;I've come across some in depth lectures from Russell A. Barkley, explaining the process of how emotions work within ADHD. Keep in mind: it's written for professionals, so the content is pretty "dry", but I personally found the *willpower fueltank* diagram pretty interesting. It explains how selfregulatory strength, the ability to control strong emotions, is a limited resource pool. There are things that deplete that pool, and there are things that replenish it (you can skip to 1:29:43 for this part).  For those that don't mind the theory, he also talks about how emotional disregulation has been a part of the core diagnosis of ADHD in the past (DSM), and how it shifted to comorbidities such as ODD (oppositional defiant disorder). He's an advocate for keeping emotions within the ADHD criteria, as it would better explain the struggles it brings.  [The lecture (free)](http://adhdlectures.com/lecture-view.php?LectureID=16)

In light of gathering information, I wanted to assemble a list of websites, books, podcasts, articles etc. that can help us get started.

I want to thank you for helping setting the tone for this place; where different opinions can be expressed as we genuinely believe it adds to a richer soundingboard, and being respectful about it.  I also want to thank you for enriching this community with your advice and anecdotes,    and when nothing else can be said, your words of comfort and understanding when needed the most.  That being said, let's keep it short and sweet.    Glad to have you on board! Carry on :)
c9baecf611aaa6730c44e21820eb4684b57a316000093e7e2d085ac5ba816c5b;;;Announcement;;;I see a lot of frustrations floating around in the form of vent-posts, and they are most likely justified. Some of you are familiar here and have stated in the past why their frustrations are related to ADHD, so they don't need to re-introduce their circumstances everytime. However, I have noticed this tendency has been picked up by newcomers that leave us  guessing the relevance of their concerns to this ADHD focused subreddit.  Therefore the rules section will have an addition:  **I will ask you to make a brief statement in the beginning of your post wether your S.O./friend/relative has been diagnosed or not, just written as DX or NDX will do just fine.**  In addition, we'll soon be rolling out a weekly vent-thread where you can write off your frustrations. This will be tested for a few weeks, with the intent to make room for a more constructive debate regarding our loved ones.  &#x200B;  Edit: As a counterpart, we feel there's a need for a **Weekly Victory thread** aswell, where you can share your successes small or big. These will be rolled out somewhere this week, so stay tuned!

Part 2: [http://www.blogtalkradio.com/attentiontalkradio/2012/03/01/the-impact-of-adhd-on-sex-and-intimacy-the-sequel](http://www.blogtalkradio.com/attentiontalkradio/2012/03/01/the-impact-of-adhd-on-sex-and-intimacy-the-sequel)They pick up where they left roughly around 10:00  And this in [addition to the podcast](https://adhdrollercoaster.org/book-club/chapter-6-adhd-and-sex/).  Until recently my perception of sex issues in ADHD was that there's a chance of sex- and pornaddiction. There's so little decent research about this, and I can't imagine we're the only couple struggling with this. But Gina Pera brought up 2 additional hurdles:  \- failure to initiate/always initiating  \- the same thing over and over again  edit: Some solutions towards 25:00edit 2: part 2
