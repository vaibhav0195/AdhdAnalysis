But when it’s about me, i am easily removed in the equation and dismissed as whatever we planned is not of importance. His reason is,” because I think I am a big boy and I can do what I want.” He kept on saying it’s not true and I told him to stop brushing it off as it has always happened before.  I feel like shit. I had to cross interstate to accomodate his needs. Do his washing, drive him around but when I ask to spend time with me the answer is always I DON’T FUCKING KNOW if have plans or PLANS MAY COME UP SO I MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE. Then asks you to plan despite that and fucking cancels on you.  My friends have told me to just do it by myself. So after an argument today, i dropped him off and told him I’m going to the show I reserved and he shouldn’t come anymore. He ends up texting me that he wants to go. I told him i sent him the tickets and he can come if he wants to but I’m not reserving him any seats. He didn’t end up going. I had dinner alone, drank alone and walked alone. Don’t get me wrong but I like taking myself on dates but it is different when you planned to spend it with someone else.  I’m now in a lobby of the hotel we’re staying and crying the shit out of me. I feel like a horrible person and I don’t know why.
