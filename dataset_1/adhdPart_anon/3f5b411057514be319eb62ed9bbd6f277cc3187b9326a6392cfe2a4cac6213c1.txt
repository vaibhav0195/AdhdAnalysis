But with his chronic unemployment and lack of help with chores/household stuff I'm worried its not the right decision. I love him like crazy.  Also edited to add - he wants to change, and is in CBT and taking meds, but we've seen very little improvement in 2+ years.   I'm asking those of you with all of the kids/house/etc responsibilities: If you could go back in time, would you have stayed with your partner, but not have children?  Do you regret having kids with your partner?  Do you wish you had cut and run?
