We have been together a long time and I love him very very much. I am just looking for sympathy and maybe advice if there is any out there.  One aspect of his ADHD that I really struggle with is the amount time he takes to make decisions and carry out tasks. I understand how important it is to let someone with ADHD decide or do something for themselves and not have me take over for them, and as I am a decisive and proactive person this requires an immense amount of patience from me. I try very hard not to do things for him and let him come to a conclusion or carry out a task on his own. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed and sad when we miss out on important things that one or both of us wants because my partner has taken too long to make a decision, send an email, or make a phone call.  For example, we have recently lost out on house we were trying to buy because he took too long on deciding whether to go ahead after the seller had accepted our offer, and the seller got bored of waiting for us and accepted a different offer. When the seller and our solicitor pressed us for an answer it made him more stubborn in his indecision. He has missed out on job opportunities because he did not get his CV in before the deadline. On a smaller scale we have missed many a date night because he can't decide what to do or where to go, and then before he's decided the evening is over. Fellow partners of ADHD-folk, how do you cope with this aspect of your loved one? I don't want to be bitter towards him because I know its not his fault, but I can't help feeling sad and frustrated sometimes.
