So he will largely be ok-ish and then it seems I can feel a tension building. Like a tidlewave gaining momentum and size. It'll start simple like not talking to me, then it'll be snippy statements when I ask him to do something. Then, everytime, I'll get the "why are you so negative? I cant ever do anything right to you."  Followed by a few days of passive aggressive pouting. Then the wave makes landfall. Almost anything can set it off. This time I asked if he had cleaned the litter pan. But it wasn't that I had asked, it was "how" I asked. This results in the same situation no matter the trigger: an hour or two of hime telling me how lazy,filthy, and otherwise insufferable I am. And then a side order of how sad I make him and I always tear him down and why cant I be happy? But once he gets it all out I'll ha e a week or two of semi normalcy, or as normal as he will ever be.   Anyone else deal with this?
