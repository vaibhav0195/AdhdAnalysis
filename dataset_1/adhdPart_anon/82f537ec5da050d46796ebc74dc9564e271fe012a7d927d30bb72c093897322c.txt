A week ago my partner agreed to have a designated time and day (she chose Sunday at 6 pm) to work on our relationship and have actual quality time together. A week later she’s saying she’d rather work on her hobby and do our thing “later” because she’s tired and just wants to work on her hobby. I said no, that’s not okay. That I feel hurt, disrespected, and disregarded by her attitude, apparent indifference, and lack of interest in helping our marriage and keeping her word. She was noncommittal. Mind you she had already spent 4 hours on it today.   She then went and slept for a while, then went and spent more time working on her hobby despite what I had said and what she had originally promised. I just feel so crushed and depressed, yet also so angry and resentful. It’s bedtime in 50 minutes. We’ve hardly spent any time together this week and she has been nasty to me a couple of times over stupid things. Now this?   I don’t know whether to cry or yell. What do I do here??
