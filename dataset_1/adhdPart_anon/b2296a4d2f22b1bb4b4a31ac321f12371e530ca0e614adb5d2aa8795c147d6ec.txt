Sometimes he won’t touch them for months, other times it’s all he does for extended periods of time. I’m currently a stay at home wife while I get through college, and I have no friends at the place we live at. So when this happens, he goes to work, comes home, hops on his game and talks to his friends all day, and then comes to bed long after me and I get no human interaction at all that day.   I’m currently going through a bad period with my mental health and the social isolation I feel makes it so much worse. I’ve tried to tell myself I should be happy he has such an innocent hobby. At least he’s not spending money, or out doing something he’s not supposed to do. But it still hurts. I feel like I’m not important at all and that he doesn’t value the time we spend together.   When I bring up how I feel, he makes more of an effort to be near me. Unfortunately he thinks sitting next to me watching videos on his phone is the same as spending time with me, or he’ll ask if I want to watch a movie so we sit together in silence for 2 hours and then he hops right back onto his game.   I’m just so lonely right now. I want to throw the damn computer away while he’s gone at work. I never would,  but that’s just how I feel.

Sometimes, when we get into arguments, he ignores me and goes on like everything is fine. He plays his games, he laughs at videos on his phone, he posts funny videos of himself while he’s at work. Meanwhile, I’m miserable. I’m hurt, I’m laid up in bed, I’m crying, I’m anxious.   It really confuses me because my husband is an extremely empathetic person. When I cry, he cries. When I’m hurting, he’s hurting. But then he has times like this where he just acts like he completely doesn’t care, which makes the hurt that much worse. Just wondering if anyone else experienced this too.

Sent me a picture for proof and everything! I’m not exactly sure what to expect and I know I won’t see results right away, but I’m so happy he finally did it. This seems like a major step in the right direction.
