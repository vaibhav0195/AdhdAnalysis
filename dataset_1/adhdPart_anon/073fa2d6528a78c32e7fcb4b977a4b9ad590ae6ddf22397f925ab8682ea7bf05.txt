I’ve read through countless articles that claim to offer coping strategies for the spouse without ADHD. I haven’t discovered a single thing to help me cope with his ADHD. Every single one can be distilled down to, “do your best, but that’s all you get.”    Understand his symptoms so you can better empathize and see things from his point of view. Build on your partners strengths determine what they’re good at and enjoy doing around the house and set up clear agreements you each understand your responsibilities. Rediscover what you love about each other so you can rekindle that spark. Separate who your partner is from their symptoms or behaviors. Stop trying to parent your partner. Watch what you say and how you say it. Find humor in the situation.  I feel like I’ve been doing all of that for 10+ years. I’ve always been a mindful and deeply emotional person. Pregnancy seemed to permanently heighten that, and the past few years I’ve been constantly working on myself and perspective to improve my ability to stay in the present moment and be more understanding toward everyone. I’ve mostly curbed the anxiety that seemed to have developed and been exasperated by his adhd symptoms.  I understand his symptoms as best I can. I’ve devoured every scrap of information about ADHD and sent him a lot of great, validating about ADHD to help him understand his symptoms better. I know that he isn’t being inattentive or thoughtless on purpose. It isn’t easy to find the humor in him forgetting to scoop the cat littler for the 3rd time in a row and now I am cleaning up cat shit off the carpet (again) first thing when I wake up. He didn’t mean to, I get it. Ok. But what about when those sort of things keep happening? What about when I give up expecting him to do it so I add that task to my long todo list?  What do I do when he so emotionally inattentive? When the mere mention of a negative feeling is seen as an attack? When emotional validation is nonexistent? When I get thrown under the bus or disregarded because he wants so desperately to please his family even if it’s at the expense of my needs?  Sorry for the rant. All that is to say, does anyone have actual ways of coping? Or should I just start working on accepting all of this as an irrefutable reality? He’s medicated, but still trying to find the right kind. Apparently typical stimulants don’t work, his body is really quick to process them and they decrease in efficacy over time. I’m trying to be patient for all of his meds and therapy to start working, but I feel like I’m going to be waiting my whole life.  Thanks for reading, this sub has helped my struggles feel valid. 💕
