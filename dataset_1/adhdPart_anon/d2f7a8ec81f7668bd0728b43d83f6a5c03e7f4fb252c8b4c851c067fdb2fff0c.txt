d2f7a8ec81f7668bd0728b43d83f6a5c03e7f4fb252c8b4c851c067fdb2fff0c;;;Marriage help;;;My partner(diagnosed ADHD, 41 yrs old) and I (non-ADHD, 31 yrs old) have been having problems since the start of our relationship 10 years ago. Things became more complicated and difficult with time, marriage, and having 2 kids. I did not realize that he might have ADHD until we were married and he never revealed this either. I always thought he was the quirky, fun guy who was a little different. Anyway, now 2 kids in, years of therapy both individually and together, I do not know if I can live with his ADHD for the rest of my life. I love him as a person but have so many emotions towards him as a partner and I do not know if therapy can help me. The more I try to read about ADHD, understand it and him, the more I question whether this is something I can accept and live with. I have to mention that he is overall a wonderful, loving husband and dad. He is there for my in bigger picture type of ways. Maybe my expectations for a partner are too high in my mind and they don't match my reality? I know everyone has their good and bad qualities so maybe I am living in a fantasy world. I can't unsee all of his faults and this affects our relationship in every way. I have become more understanding of the fact that he cannot control or change many things about himself.   However, this really leaves me to question whether I can deal with this for the rest of my life. I am not attracted to him, have no sex drive, and spending time with him makes me anxious as we tend to bicker and fight if I point things out to him. This leaves me with the feeling of disappointment and sadness.  It is a continuous spiral and I feel like he is my 3rd child and not my partner. Am I being selfish? Has anyone else had these feelings?
