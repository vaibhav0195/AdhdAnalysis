Husband is on the verge of a diagnosis after 12 years. I've been saying for years hes probably ADD (i work with traumatized youth) and hes finally agreed to seek help. Its been a journey but were finally getting somewhere. All of the stories I've been reading and comments from other spouses are like moments from our life. I'm so grateful to have found you!!  I didn't see one but can someone let me know what your acronyms are? Add/adhd are self explanatory but not sure what some of the other ones are. TIA

Recently diagnosed hubby is so full of anxiety, rage, and confusion I'm walking on eggshells. Looks, tone, and phrases I don't know are issues seem to be triggering him. I know he has PTSD and RAD to boot, but it's just been hard.   He knows it's an issue. He is apologizing daily for being in a bad mood and is tired of apologizing. I'm telling him he doesn't need to apologize for his mood, just his actions. He's tired and frustrated and just wants to be "normal ". In addition we have to apply for LTD until he is stable on his meds.   Were trying to keep open communication but I feel like he's able to express himself but I'm not. I needed to tell him tonight I understand this is a difficult time for him, but he needs to grant me the same grace. I'm not the one struggling with ADHD but I deal with his fallout, regulating our son, regulating the dog, and if I have any energy left, regulating myself.   I'm just so tired. I'm miss my husband
