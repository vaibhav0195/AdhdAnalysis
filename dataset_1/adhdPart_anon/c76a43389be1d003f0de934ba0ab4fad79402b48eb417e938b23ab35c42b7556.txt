Almost all of the attendees (all women) in the class are in the early stages of anger, frustration, sadness, and contemplating divorce. That was me in a lot of ways only nine months ago but my ADHD partner has embraced what it means and how it works, and we've turned around the ship.  Every Sunday night we sit down and go through our dry erase [weekly/monthly calendar](https://www.amazon.com/Calendar-Whiteboard-Magnetic-Calendars-Refrigerator/dp/B07K2DBNDP/ref=sr_1_11?crid=2IO85X8PQLOFX&dchild=1&keywords=magnetic+whiteboard+for+fridge&qid=1600104516&sprefix=magnetic+white%2Caps%2C161&sr=8-11) to make sure all the tasks are accounted for, we organize our medications for each day thanks to pill sorters, and he set timers in his phone to make sure meds were taken and tasks completed. I'm so proud of how far he's come in these nine months, in spite of the frustration finding a good and consistent doctor and three medication switches.  There is hope, if you can partner up and tackle the problems together, you can work as a team to create the home and life you want to have. It takes responsibility to handle it and it definitely still gets frustrating sometimes even when things even out, but once you get on the same page as a team it can get so much better than it seems today.  I really recommend Melissa Orlov's classes if you can afford it. The couples class completely turned it all around for us.

It's such a huge help to hear each other, hear what works, vent, cry, etc. The session was 10 people, all women, all wives of men with ADHD in various states of help and acceptance. It's made me realize how far my husband and I have come since his diagnosis and medication, and I've learned how to listen to others who talk about it. If you can afford it, please seriously consider attending her next one. It's such a relief to hear others speak about their experiences, and she offers great advice while she leads the sessions.

He is medicated and understands how his ADD affects our lives.  However.  He's been out of work since March, laid off right before lockdown. I work full time from home and do well so we've been fine financially, but his unemployment runs out very soon (and our state hasn't made a payment to him in two weeks without notice or reason, but he won't get on the phone about it because he says has to sit on hold for hours). I helped him revamp his resume and he has an interview soon, but the kitchen is a MESS (his turf), the garbage cans are tipped over and still sitting in the alley after being put out there on Tuesday, and he's currently asleep with our dogs while I'm in front of my computer for work. Whenever I stick my head in his office, on his computer screen is hobby stuff, not a job search. He knows the house is his to manage while I work but I still have to make lists of what needs to be done even though it should be obvious. If I make a list and point it out he'll do it, but he'll do only 80% of it.  I've told him before that I feel taken advantage of, since I'm bringing in a good paycheck we can live on, and he says he understands but here we are. I know that in his mind, he thinks having an interview means he doesn't have to keep looking for work so he's free to slack. It's so frustrating and I've been very gentle and nice because he hurts easily but my patience is wearing so thin. I don't want to parent him, he's an adult and should know he needs to get up and do stuff, but apparently he doesn't. I don't know how else I can say it or what else I can say, I'm getting near the end of my rope before I snap at him.
