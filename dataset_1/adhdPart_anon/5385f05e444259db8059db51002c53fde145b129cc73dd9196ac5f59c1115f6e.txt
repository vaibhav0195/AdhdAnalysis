I’m looking for some advice/support/insight on how to deal with my partner who has adhd, shutting down post conflict.   The other night he made a comment that was minor, but it upset me a little and it made me feel disrespected. I had sent him some job information (I thought I was being helpful) a week ago, and then the other night it got brought up again and he told me “almost every time you send me stuff like that it almost never helps me whatsoever”  He said after I asked, that he understands I was just trying to be helpful, and he gave me a half as apology but I accepted it anyways. I then was super cool and ok, I had in my mind squashed everything and was ready to return to normalcy. Reassured him that I’m not mad at him, hug and kiss and whatnot.   He then shuts down, goes to the bedroom lays in the dark and silence, spiralling negative thoughts about himself, bc he felt bad for what he did. This lasts for a couple hours. (Sometimes until the next morning!) I checked on him periodically, but he was so unresponsive, there was no getting him out of the funk. No matter what I try to do, doesn’t work. I ask him what he needs, he doesn’t know. Nothing.   I’m also a very anxious person, I especially have difficulty with taking on others emotions, trying to fix everything, etc. So seeing him like that though breaks my heart, and I have no idea how to help him or what to do in those situations. And it in turn makes me feel really really bad that I brought it up.   Am I being manipulated? Because it sometimes feels like maybe I am being punished for bringing it up, because he knows that I’m now feeling awful, In lieu of him feeling awful...   Thanks in advance, I appreciate any advice or support you’re willing to give ♥️
