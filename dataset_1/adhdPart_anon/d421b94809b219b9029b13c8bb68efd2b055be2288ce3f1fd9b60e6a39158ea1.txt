d421b94809b219b9029b13c8bb68efd2b055be2288ce3f1fd9b60e6a39158ea1;;;Divorce ?;;;Spouse of DX, on meds.  I’d love to hear from partners of ADHD spouses that did all the soul searching, reading, therapy over the years etc etc .... and also the weighing of breaking up a family unit with kids.  And after all that, just ended up doing it.  Getting the divorce.  And how it ended up.  Anyone?  I’m 25 yrs in, almost 20 yrs married with 3 school aged kids and demanding FT job. The resentment is toxic but I’m terrified of hurting all of us.
