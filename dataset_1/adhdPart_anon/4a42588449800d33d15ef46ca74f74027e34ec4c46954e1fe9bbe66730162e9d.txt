I was once so patient, but after a couple of years dealing with the defensiveness, I turn to rage and just yell. I don't mean to, but I'm so fed up, it's like a demon takes over and I just rage. It doesn't matter how simple...did you remember to take out the garbage before bed? "I SAID I'D DO IT LATER." Hey, Bob, when's the last time you changed the baby? "I DON'T KNOW! I DON'T KNOW!" Can you just tell me if it was in the past hour? "I SAID I DON'T KNOW!" Well, was it 30 minutes ago? Diaper seems very full and it's leaking onto his onesie? "FINE, SURE, IT WAS 30 MINUTES AGO!" He's not yelling, but he has such a defensive tone like I'm attacking his entire 32 years of existence on this planet. And I say, "Bob, take a step back. Do you see how defensive you're getting when I ask a simple question?" Then I get so angry, I just yell! "Ya know what mf. Forget about it. I'll figure it all out myself!" Then later he'll cry and apologize. And I ask him why apologize when this behavior will just happen again and again? I feel my life has been taken away. I know it's just as frustrating for him to organize his thoughts and try to remember, but constantly getting bootyhurt like that and getting defensive like I've just attacked his entire being has killed all communication and I'm left crying and wanting to just run away. Like, ffs.

Not for him. He knows there's a problem. He knows its destroying our marriage. He cries and pleads. I've sent him articles, online quizzes, discussed, screamed, cried, begged, made his appointments, got him on meds, do everything...washing, cooking, cleaning, paying the bills cause he can't remember, do all the shopping/appointments/taking him to and from work cause he can't drive (never has, doesn't try to learn at 32 y/o), pack his daily lunch, clean up his monstrous messes, finding everything he loses, remind him of important dates to file taxes, go to appointments, begged him to make daily to-do lists...and he can't mentally or physically put in the effort...I fucking can't. Married for almost 2 years. I can't take it anymore. Marriage is a team. It's 50/50. All the burden is on me and I can't leave. No job, no family, we have a 6 month old, no child care, car is fucking falling apart...I didn't sign up for this. My life and mental health has diminished. Omfg.

Piles of clothes, trash, rotten food mixed in with piles of clean/dirty clothes, shoved under bed, down in the couch, shoved in unused back-packs/bags  Throwing trash/food on the floor in a clean room for no reason  Not showering for weeks  Wearing dirty clothes/underwear over and over for weeks  Not brushing teeth for months  Not wiping hands when eating, then touching and soiling everything with food covered hands. Walls, light switches, clothes, remotes/controllers etc  My husband is adhd dx and suggested ASD. He's disgusting and I'm a control/clean freak. I'm just trying to understand what the hell is going on here. He smells and he's gross. I won't eat anything he's prepared because of his black fingernails and lack of cleanliness. I also won't touch anything he's touched without cleaning it first because he leaves greasy debris on everything. We don't sleep together and I've pushed him and all of his trash into a spare bedroom, which literally smells like a stock yard. He says he just doesn't remember to pick up or clean himself or his environment.
