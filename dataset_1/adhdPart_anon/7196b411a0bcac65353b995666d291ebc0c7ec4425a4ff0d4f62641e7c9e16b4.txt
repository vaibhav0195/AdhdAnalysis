My partner is waiting for his appointment be diagnosed, not medicated yet, but 100% sure he has ADHD.I have been trying to research some ways to deal with him and get him to help me more with the chores... I am so tired of doing everything, and even when he finally does something, he doesn't do it properly or stopping halfway, so anyways he is not much of a help and all the chores are on me.  I'm really hoping that medication and therapy will help him, but I know it's not like the medication will magically make ADHD disappear. Even though he really wants to change and be better at helping me, it doesn't happen and he just spends another day laying on the sofa, while I'm running around, do the groceries, cook, clean, WHILE I need to concentrate on my studies as well, and it sometimes feel like he just makes my life harder.. Leaves his clothes all over, the bathroom is fucking disgusting, the kitchen is a mess.. I just can't deal with it anymore. I'm not a maid to just run around and clean up his mess, but if I don't do it, I just end up living in a nasty apartment, which is even worse.  I'm just not sure how to talk to him about it, I tried several times, he always promises to do everything and this time he is actually gonna make an effort etc.. NEVER happens.  I am really desperate.. Every once in a while I just feel like I can't do this anymore, and I love him a lot, but I can't imagine him as a future husband or father of my children. This is not the way I want to live my life.. :(  How can I motivate him or is there any strategy to try that could be helpful? I would really appreciate some help!!
