1d950d3cd3d89c3bdb9e43fb9cb2340d8b54b04b9cf3bba2ae58b93706f7e43f;;;My DX'ed wife and I are finally making it work and happier than ever after 15 years together. We can't pretend to have all the answers, and our experience is just ours. But we as a team want to offer an "AMA" (or "AUA" since its "us", not just "me"). If we can help in anyway, we want to!;;;I know a lot of people are struggling with the relationship challenges that come with ADHD. I came to this thread about a year ago looking for answers, but found a lot of the posts weren't encouraging or solutions focused.  For more context - She has ADHD, Generalized Anxiety, Rejection Sensitivity Disorder, and Depression. I found out recently I have complex PTSD causing me to be more emotionally stunted, which didn't help our match. We were on the verge of breakup 4 months ago, but we made some giant strides as a couple and individuals that has now left us happier than ever with each other since then.  If there's any way in which we can share some of that hope and joy, or help you and your loved one get over any hurdles, we'd love to help!
