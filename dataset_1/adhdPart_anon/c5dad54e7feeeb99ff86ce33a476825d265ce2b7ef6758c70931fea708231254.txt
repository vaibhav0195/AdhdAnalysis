No empathy.;;;Hi All,    This is my first post here, though I regularly scroll through and read posts and comments which helps immensely in not feeling so alone in this struggle. I am curious as to if any of you struggle with your partner being "too honest" if that makes sense? Or delivering messages with no empathy.  I understand ADHD can lead to strained social manners and anxiety which hes had all his life, but it can still be too much. I'll just give an example that sticks out in my head. This happened the third month into quarantine:   My partner and I are both in pretty incredible shape. We met at a gym. He is a fitness trainer and manager. I am an active gym goer along with pole dance and pilates instructor. Needless to say, without being conceited we both have "nice" figures. With that being said when quarantine first hit and still NOW (though we have found a private gym to workout at) ..both of our places to workout were closed. So I was diligently doing home workouts which of course do not compare to gym workouts and now no longer had 8 hours of dance cardio in my routine. I definitely was no longer as LEAN but definitely still in shape. However, my body holds weight in nice places like my hips and my ass and my waist stayed very snatched so I did not mind the weight, I actually kinda liked it. SO when i was walking by the mirror with him I said "hmm I like me body right now surprisingly." I was not even talking to him. just outloud to myself. And he chimes in "lets be honest though, we've all gained weight since quarantine. Your body is nowhere near in its prime anymore like it used to be."  I blew up and lost my shit and as all of you know with an ADHD partner that goes nowhere. They will always outdo you even if you are dead wrong. he could not fathom what he did wrong. WHAT? DID I SAY SOMETHING THAT WASN'T TRUE? IT WASNT MEANT TO HURT YOUR FEELINGS, JUST A VERY TRUE FACT. DONT BE SO EMOTIONAL. ... yadda yadda. THis happens ALOT and drives me insane. HIs dont be so emotional RANT. AND IM LIKE you have ADHD.. you are the most emotional you just dont see it. ughghghghghghgh I SERIOUSLY SERIOUSLY WISH HE COULD SEE HOW DIFFICULT AND EVEN HURTFUL HE CAN .. DO ANY OF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCES LIKE THIS
