He has all the classic symptoms and struggles because of them. He hates the doctors becausehe fears he'll be rejected, he'll never go even if he's really sick or injured, so I was very proud he went.   He got the referral but the GP had to go and say "I don't think you have it because you hold down a job"   I'm gob smacked. He works in programming and his jobs always changing and solving puzzles, so it suits his characteristics well.   So he's come back feeling defeated and like he doesn't want to try (rejection sensitivity is something he really struggles with)
