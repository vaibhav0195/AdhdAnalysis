I (NT) have tried different ways of communicating these things to my partner (DX, medicated) and I seem to step in it no matter what.   For example, "I" statements about how I feel in "x" situation often lead to long defensive monologues about why they did what they did and how it's a perfectly reasonable thing to do; being forthright and speaking up in the moment leads to being spoken over and interrupted; waiting for a time when everyone is calm and relaxed leads to long, winding discussions that go in circles and don't resolve with any sort of agreement. I suspect, from things I've read here and elsewhere, that these reactions are largely tied to their ADHD.  Please, internet, help! Have you found any ways of letting your partner know when they've hurt you or someone else that helps them "get it" without either getting into an argument or being steamrolled?   Also, I'm so glad to have found this community! It's such a relief to know that I'm not alone.
