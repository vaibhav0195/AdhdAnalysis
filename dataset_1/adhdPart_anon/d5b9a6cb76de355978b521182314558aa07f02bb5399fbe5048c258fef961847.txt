d5b9a6cb76de355978b521182314558aa07f02bb5399fbe5048c258fef961847;;;Do I really love my partner if I only love them after they take their meds?;;;My partner (dx) takes their medication at 9 am so that its effects last for as long as possible (about 12 hours). We get up before then, of course, and have coffee, get ready for work, etc. But until they take their medication, they are unbearable and annoying. I try to take my time in the rest room and dress slooooooowly to avoid them, all the while thinking, "I cannot *wait* until you take your meds!"   If I only really like the medicated version of my partner, do I really love them?
