I work at a large law firm and my wife (DX) is a stay-at-home mother. We have four kids under age of 11.  We’ve been married 10 years, but this wasn’t really an issue until about 2 years ago.  I work at a large law firm, which pays well but is stressful and a tad bit soul crushing. It’s not unusual to put in a few 10-12 hour days a week with a normal day of a solid 8-9 hours. It wasn’t until COVID and working from home that I realized how much ADHD was affecting our lives.   I’ve been working from home for about nine months now and seeing my wife on her phone, in bed, or watching TV more often than not is starting to make me bitter.   I’m usually the one to get up in the morning and get the kids ready (my wife has trouble falling asleep at night), and I’m usually the one to get the kids going to bed. I’m also usually the only one of us to do any housework after 7:00pm. We spilt meal prep about 50-50 (less so pre-Covid).  I feel like a jerk because she has been improving and addressing her ADHD. But 2020 has added significant stress to both our lives, and this issue is really festering inside of me.   We’ve tried to have discussions about this, but they seem to be making things worse. She shuts down, and when we can get past her shutting down, the discussion turns to how I need to do better about dealing with her ADHD, which really gets me angry and upset.
