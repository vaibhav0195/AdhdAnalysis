82e3797366b400647dd31bdf611526ccc2c67d1918f4f6ebd15f6247febafb3f;;;Perfect In their own way;;;Just thought I’d post this. I know our partners drive us insane and make us furious, but I just wanted to appreciate how amazing they can be.   How considerate and thoughtful they can be.  How much effort it takes for them to be able to do so but they do it to make us happy.  It may not seem like it but they do try but when they do it have a “good day” it makes it all worth it.  Just thought I’d remind everyone on the rough days to think of 5 amazing things there partner does that an “average” SO wouldn’t   1. Always thinking outside the box and attention to detail (helpful when I’m picking new clothes and need his advice if it works or not)  2. So unbelievable cleaver 3. How hard they try to put my thoughts first or intend to even if it doesn’t come across that way 😂 4. How dedicated they are to trying new things 5. How hard they try to submit there uni work even though it kills them to complete every piece of work  Those are just mine but feel free to share your own. Sometimes just getting outside of the negative mind set could help your relationship.
