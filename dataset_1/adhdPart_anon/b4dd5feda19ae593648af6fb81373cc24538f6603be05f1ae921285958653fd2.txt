b4dd5feda19ae593648af6fb81373cc24538f6603be05f1ae921285958653fd2;;;When it really isn’t enough...;;;Has anyone else gotten to the point where they’re just...done?  My spouse (Dx, Meds) has been in therapy for years, now has a med routine that is actually mostly working! I should be thrilled, right? By every metric I ever set, things are “better”.  But I’ve got to say that I’m just exhausted.  If this had happened 15 yrs ago, or 10 yrs ago, or even 5...but at this point all I can say is good luck, hun- I’m happy for you but I’m no longer interested.  I don’t know if I even have the space to be guilty about it- I’ve burned all that fuel on being angst full about our drama (see all my previous posts ::sigh::) So yeah- now that he’s in a functional space, I’m preparing for a divorce.  Anyone else finally get out when things were “good”?
