This is my first ever post, but I've felt really validated reading through everyone's experiences, and wanted to share a phone app that has been good for my bf and myself.  My co-habitating partner was diagnosed with ADHD as an adolescent (which I think was a huge blessing) and is medicated. In a lot of ways, after 5 months of quarantining together in a small apartment, the stressors in our relationship were amplified. Without diving in too much, a lot of the tension in our relationship came from the fact that I didn't feel heard in casual conversation, and his frequent distraction would leave me feeling lonely and disinteresting.   Anyways, we both downloaded something called "Love Nudge" and I think it's been good for us. It's an application that we both have on our phone and our accounts are somehow linked. You start out by both taking a quiz on your love language, which is a fun little exploration. But the main feature that I'm grateful for is you can update your "Love Tank" percentage (I know, a little hokey). When I decrease my number, he gets a notification on his phone. This is a way of letting him know that I'm feeling a little ignored, or lonely, or whatever without having to go find him and start a familiar conversation. You can also set it up to remind you to like hold hands, or go for a walk together, or do something that reinforces your needs.  Basically, it's a focused way to just give him a little update on whether or not my needs are being met without launching into it. And it lets me know if he's getting what he needs from me, too.  Anyways, I hope this is useful to someone!  tldr: An app called "Love Nudge" has given my ADHD partner and I an easy, focused way to let the other know if we are getting what we need in the relationship.
