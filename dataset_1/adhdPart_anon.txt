I know it's really helpful to vent and process, especially at the time of new diagnosis. We're really moving forward and ADHD has gone from the most important crisis and biggest threat in our relationship to just another attribute about my wife's character. We're looking forward to buying a house and having kids.   I'm leaving because I don't really need to vent and rage anymore. I've done that. I'm past the denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and finally am in acceptance. I love my wife and expect we'll stay together.   Wanted to post this here with this message to remind y'all of a fact: people in these kinds of support groups are going through the worst part. Once you are in a better place, it can be draining, unpleasant, and even triggering to be in the presence of those suffering. There are probably millions of people that are married happily to an ADHD partner, they just aren't in here struggling anymore, they move on and move off the support groups once they don't need support.   Let this message serve as proof that I'm a happy success story, that things got better, and they can get better for you too.   All the best to everyone, goodbye!

Getting it is more than just acknowledging their ADHD or breaking free from denial.  Getting it is saying "I have ADHD and it makes \_\_\_\_\_ harder, but not impossible. I'm going to continue to seek out solutions and new ways of doing things until I find something that works"  It is **not** "I have ADHD and it makes \_\_\_\_\_ impossible. Everyone just needs to give me a break and realize this is just the way I am"  It's "I tried a medication and it didn't work well for me. I'm going to keep trying different options until I find a good match"  **Not** "I had a bad experience with medication so I'm never trying one ever again"  It's " \_\_\_\_\_ (activity) isn't very stimulating for me so I'm going to utilize different tools to help me stay focused"  **Not** "\_\_\_\_\_ (activity) isn't very stimulating for me so I'm not doing it."  Some will never get it. Some will wallow in defeatism and learned helplessness for the rest of their lives. And nothing you say or do will change this attitude. All you can do is set boundaries and know when it's time to walk away.  So, when struggling to determine the longevity of an ADHD relationship you can ask yourself "Do they get it?" And if they don't, how long are you willing to wait around in the hopes that someday they will.

The amounts of posts I read on here is beyond venting - its scapegoating. Being a neglectful asshole is not a symptom of ADHD.  That post from last week where OP said she'll never date anyone with ADD/ADHD again and the amount of commenters agreeing. That post from yesterday, about being tricked into marrying someone with ADD/ADHD. Your ignorance is disgusting, stop blaming your abusive relationships on one of the most common mental conditions that barely has to do with the traits you describe. ADD/ADHD may amplify those traits, but it is most definitely not the origin.

I feel like previous to my current relationship, myself and everyone around me has generally considered me to be an understanding, easygoing person, almost to a fault.   It wasn't until now that I've started to think I'm actually an impatient, unreasonable perfectionist that demands ridiculous standards. But... I don't really believe that.   I think I'm the same reasonable person I've always been, and I think my expectations are pretty basic, and I think I'm pretty understanding when it comes to negotiating them.   But next to someone who has zero standards, zero expectations, and zero boundaries, I've got no other option but to be downright tyrannical by comparison.    I feel like I don't get to be easygoing anymore.  He gets to be fun and creative and spontaneous, and I feel like a little bit of this cherished part of myself has been swallowed up somehow.  I feel like that fun little spark in me that can struggle so hard to shine in its own quiet little way, has been sort of stamped out.  I'm trying to revive it, and god knows we're both trying so hard, but I do feel like I'm mourning some part of myself that I miss.   I know it's my responsibility to reignite this in my own way, but these are my feelings sometimes, and I wonder if anyone else shares them from time to time.

Having adhd is one thing. I'm unmedicated, and I've worked my ass off for my partner to work on my problem behaviors related to adhd (and not related).  The amount of posts on here I see with people complaining about their partner, but their partner has not put **any** effort into fixing the problem, is insane.  &nbsp;    I am definitely not perfect but come on. Having adhd can't be used as a scapegoat for just being an asshole. If your partner has not put any effort into working on their problems, and those problems are significantly impacting your relationship, *move on.*   You don't need a relationship coach to tell you that if your efforts are not being matched, if the relationship isn't 50/50, then the relationship just is not and won't work.   Being an asshole (or whatever term) is one thing. being an asshole (or whatever term) and having adhd is another. You don't have to be an asshole just because you have adhd.    Just my two cents. You guys deserve someone better, adhd or not, who actually wants to work towards better behavior or habits

But it can also be a reminder of the loneliness we all feel from time to time.  So today I wanted to say thank you.  Thank you for everything you do for your partners  Thank you for sticking by them during times when it would have been easier to walk away  Thank you for all of the accommodations, considerations, and daily emotional labor spent making their lives a little bit easier  You may never hear these things from your own partner. But I'd be willing to bet a fair number of them are so grateful to have your support.  And if they're not, well, maybe you can start turning that love inward. Celebrate yourself today and appreciate yourself. It takes a special sort of person to weather challenges like this and I'm so glad we have a space where we can all come together and grow.  Happy Valentine's Day
ac116f777f64b74bccaebc0910aeed236b8035ad8bf4d50a942cd171e3d174ed;;;Does anyone else feel like a lot of ADHD articles/info sources and such warn you not to enable/parent, but then their suggestions are essentially enabling/parenting?;;;Like... you should make sure they are responsible for their own choices, for managing their chores, for picking up the kids, etc... but it's *your* responsibility to actually keep up with the chore chart, to remind them of their own commitments, to expect to do the bulk of day to day tasks, to pick up the slack, and to just be prepared to pick up the kids yourself anyway when they inevitably don't do it... and to just be patient and understanding about it. Ok so... which is it?   I can't tell you how many times I have read that the solution is that I just need to be patient and understanding (which I'm happy to do), as well as actively responsible for everything (which I'm not as happy to do)... while the reverse doesn't seem to be expected of my ADHD partner, according to various pieces of advice. This all feels very contradictory and confusing, and often feels a bit unfair, and frankly doesn't seem to be truly useful.   I'm doing this research because I don't want to feel like his parent, I want to support him as his equal... but instead I feel like some of these sources are kind of encouraging me to mold my whole life around his ADHD symptoms, and kind of put my needs second... you know, perhaps a bit like a parent might do...? While at the same time telling me not to do this?  And it kind of feels like this same feedback is pretty widespread... I've posted on various forums, and the feedback I've often gotten has been, in a nutshell, "Look after things yourself, but also don't do it for him, but also make sure he doesn't have to."  Like... what? Which is it? What am I supposed to take from this? Do I enable him or not? What am I actually supposed to be doing? It just often feels so unhelpful, and I don't know what to think or do. At a certain point I even start questioning the very definitions of things.  So I must be missing something, right?  Please point me in the right direction so I know how to do the right thing. With feedback and advice like I have often received, I feel like I'm just going to be constantly confused, and I'm never going to truly understand how to be the supportive, healthy partner I want to be.

8ac7132f6cfd873d647cb30ffc0480fa5492e8388601880cfa0a609a791d2fd1;;;The end of the struggle;;;I’ve been the partner of an undiagnosed/unmedicated ADHD man for 12 years. Our marriage was riddled with symptoms of ADHD in a relationship: parent/child dynamic, resentment on my part, addiction/denial/deflection/blame shifting/RSD on his part.   After researching our issues and realizing that we ticked 10/10 boxes, I started working on my response to the symptoms of ADHD in a relationship. I tried every way I could imagine to get through to him. We got a counselor. I ate a bunch of shit for a very long time in a desperate attempt to make it work.  Fast forward to 1.5 months ago when I find out that he’s been having an affair. He wants to end our marriage for an online affair with a childhood friend (she’s married) and proceeds to discard me. He immediately begins a full on relationship with this woman. True to form, he does everything he wants without any consideration for the consequences of his behavior.  Now, he’s made every boneheaded decision he could possibly have made. I’m no longer cleaning up behind him, and he’s strung himself up in a fault state. He’s in a hole and digging deeper.   My friends have commented on how freakishly calm I’ve been and how it’s scary how well I’m handling this. In truth, it’s like the boot that’s been on my head has been lifted and I’m finally able to come up for air. Having the end of this relationship forced upon me has been the single best thing to have happened to me in years.   All this to say: sometimes a failed relationship isn’t actually a failure. I gave everything I could, and the relief I feel now is like a reward. I feel lighter than air, and I can feel my happiness returning as the resentment melts away. If you’re with someone who refuses to acknowledge the effect ADHD is having on your relationship, know that to end it doesn’t mean the end of you.  I am happy, and now I feel like I can leave this subreddit. Thank you to all of you who have shared your experiences. May the direction you choose be the one that leads to your happiness.

9d6ab50131cad7b46bcde45cb2864ffb65a27e3e5dd0d5450bdef5b1ee4bc9c4;;;Literally Experiences Time Differently;;;This morning I was getting dressed in the bedroom (now Partner's home office too) and he was a few feet away working on the computer. I put on an outfit, looked at it in the big mirror, AUDIBLY SAID "nah, not this", walked over to the closet, changed, walked back in front of the mirror to check myself out. About a five minute thing.   Partner looked up and I could hear the X-Files theme playing behind his eyes. "You were just wearing something else?" "Yeah, then I changed."  "No, like, a second ago. You turned around and now it's different." Y'all he was CONVINCED I time traveled or quick-changed or something. He literally did not register the five minutes passing and me changing. It was mind-blowing. So many arguments suddenly made sense.
f4da4185bf9e715d4072154247cbceda71c95911fa29da8b0483a16eaaa9de3d;;;Reminder: Be Kind to Yourself and Your Partner—Things are Extra Hard Right Now;;;I don’t know who else needs to hear this today, but I certainly needed to remind myself that everything is a struggle for everyone right now in this pandemic, and for ADHDers it’s even worse. I’m a non-DX wife (but with an appointment to be screened myself because there are signs) of a DX husband. We were barely married for a few months before the pandemic sent us into lockdown last March, and hoo boy has this been a test of our relationship. The lack of structure to his time since he lost his job (COVID related), co-morbidities w/other illnesses, inability to socialize in person with his support network on a regular basis, etc. has been absolutely brutal on him, and by extension, me.   Well, I decided yesterday that I am going to try to take a different mindset, which is one that acknowledges that these circumstances are abnormal and temporary, and that my partner is trying their best. The thing we both need more than anything right now is each other’s compassion and support. We still need accountability and boundaries too, of course.   Just today there was a situation where he was out doing an errand and realized that he hadn’t eaten a meal or taken his medications yet. This happens a few times a week. My knee jerk response is usually to sigh and say something like “You really need to get that under control.” We both know that’s true, but it wouldn’t have been a helpful thing to say in that moment when we were talking about it. Instead, I just said “You’re doing your best, sweetie.” And when he got home and fell down a rabbit hole on his phone, I playfully chided him that he still needed to eat and take his pills. He finished up what he was doing and then went and did that. And it felt like a far better interaction than if I had just kept pounding the point of eating and taking meds consistently. My job isn’t to parent or manage him; it’s to be a supportive spouse. It’s to love. It’s to be kind. And maybe if I’m kinder to him, I’ll also be kinder to myself. Goodness knows he does it for me.  Anyway, to those out there who are really feeling the struggle in this chaos, I see you.

Neither is right or wrong.   It is important that if you want to maintain a healthy relationship, you observe what they do, and tweek your needs, to meet with patterns they already have. Work together.   For example, and this may seem silly- but if they put their clothes on the floor in the same spot every day and you hate it, put a laundry basket there.   If that doesn't work, try a different method until you find one that sticks. You will find one! Remain hopeful!
b4677976efbf677c4de66826c1a4f92443bedbfd09e1b0fc3ad32349fc289dcb;;;Adhd doesnt mean abusive;;;I wish someone had sat me down a long time ago and made me understand this. Just because someone has adhd doesnt mean its okay they forget about you, flip interest back and forth, put themself first, dont help with the relationship, lie, gaslight, acting out in violence, 'accidentially' rape or assault you, devalue you, discard you, project their problems on you, project their apathy on you, just to name a few.  You dont have to take it, because you want to be empathic towards your abusive partner. You dont have to ruin yourself because they dont see you as a separat human being from themselves. You do not have to feel guilty for leaving and finding a partner who is good to you.  All of the above things have nothing to do with adhd, however youve might been told he/she just cant help it. If you have to tell yourself everyday that youre strong enough to take it, then stop, and ask yourself why you dont feel like you deserved to be loved, seen and supported, and then go get help. You might be in a codependent relationship.  There are many many lovely adhd people. This is not to say anything negative about adhd. Only those who use it as an excuse to abuse their partners or spouses.  So many people write on this sub, explaining abusive neglective behaviour like its the norm for a adhd partner. It truly isnt. They are either assholes or misdiagnosed if they continue to do these things.

It's a slippery slope to alienating and polarising both sides.Not everyone has the same level of knowledge on this, that's why we're working behind the screens on a more extended [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD_partners/wiki/index).

bafda2c8e12894c335301c2f89f8f21400d83dfd083be2271293e1ae2ea0f95c;;;I am desperate to hear your reasoning for staying with your partner when you are struggling so badly. What keeps us all in these cages we have allowed ourselves to be placed in?;;;I feel like im going to throw up from the amount of stress my DX boyfriend puts me through. He is the most untrustworthy, irresponsible, unreliable, disorganized, forgetful, irrational, confusing, inattentive human I have ever met. I never experienced anger until we moved in together. I used to be so patient. I have completely lost myself and I will never be the same again.  But then I sit here and I read all of the things people say on this sub about how horrible their parters are which makes me realize how absolutely not horrible mine is, but i feel like it almost makes it worse in a way. I wish he was an abusive lying manipulative POS, I wish he was an asshole unwilling to work on himself and make changes who didn’t appreciate anything that I did and didn’t recognize how badly he hurts me. Because if he was any of those things I would have left no questions asked. But he his none of that.   He is patient, kind, supportive, loving, understanding, apologetic, self reflective, incapable of being mad at me for anything, always takes responsibility for his actions, makes me feel so valued and important, and is endlessly outspoken about his passionate desire to be the man I need one day, yet at the same time reassuring that if I can’t take it anymore he understands and doesn’t blame me. I never feel like I don’t want to spend time with him. He is hilarious, creative, passionate, unique, and genuinely good hearted.  I see the making of such an incredible human being in his eyes.   So seemingly this is why I continue to hold on, but why is everything so incredibly contradictory? Do the good things really outweigh the bad to the point that I am willing to have breakdown after breakdown because he failed to do something basic for the billionth time therefore reminding me that I am the only human in my life I will ever be able to rely on? I know my future will be full of stress and anxiety and disappointment riddled with shame because I feel guilty for being unhappy the second he makes me laugh again.  I just need to know why we do this to ourselves. Is this some sort of self inflicted emotional abuse? We are bleeding out and need a doctor to perform surgery, so why are we sitting still allowing a nurse to just keep putting bandaids on us?
138636f3661d9d88fa2b8de9aeefb8311af6554c9d8b56196839bd416a21d494;;;Feeling loved and understood by my non-ADHD spouse;;;DX and Medicated ADHD spouse here.  We've been married 13 years.  I was diagnosed about 3 years ago.  Been in marriage counseling for about 4 years.  Just here to share a praise in how my husband dealt with something that would have previously set us off onto a cycle of both of us feeling unloved and disrespected. Progress matters.    Deep Background: Our marriage counselor asked us each to give each other some reading material that would help one another understand each other.  I gave my husband Sari Solden's Book, "Women with Attention Deficit Disorder."  For my part, I am reading Barkley's, "When an Adult You Love has ADHD"  (sorry for how this disorder impacts others... yuck!)  Context:  Husband came home after being out of town for 8 days and asked why his toothbrush had lipstick on it.  I responded that if a toothbrush has lipstick on it, it is only because I thought it was my toothbrush.  I went on to explain that usually I can tell out toothbrushes apart by checking to see which one is wet (he gets ready for bed first, gets up first).  But since he has been out of town, I can't check that way.  Husband reminds me of the color difference and I again said that I can't ever seem to remember which color is which.    (Remember, working memory can be hard for us ADHD folks.  There is much I do remember... am super sharp.. graduated summa cum laude, ect... but remembering which toothbrush is mine.... IMPOSSIBLE. Yes, it drives me crazy, too).    For our first decade of marriage this admittance that I had used his toothbrush and couldn't remember would have set him off into feeling disrespected and unloved, which meant that he then treated me as a child and set us off into a downward spiral.  BUT THIS TIME and perhaps for the first time, he didn't take my forgetfulness personally and just PUT A STICKY NOTE ON OUR MIRROR that has our names and which color toothbrush we each have.  I love it.  I go in the bathroom and before grabbing a toothbrush I just read the sticky note.  No condemnation from him.  No telling me I should just be able to remember. He just quickly gave me a tool that would help me..... 'cause I promise, every time I brush my teeth I want to be using my own toothbrush.    I don't know if this will be helpful for any of you -- just wanted to praise my neurotypical spouse for dealing well with something that I KNOW had the option of being super frustrating for him.

My brothers were all very sexist and put ALL the chores on me. My nuclear family consist of 6 people and we were all SLOBS. It was horrific and very stress inducing to be the one blamed for it all.   Anyway, I've been with my partner for 2 years now. We moved in together, living together around 1 year. His inability to clean was a point of contention, and we have argued about it a LOT. He agreed I was doing a majority of the chores/food shopping and whatever else, and tried to work on doing chores daily.   He has significantly improved, and I'm so thankful for all the effort hes putting into this. Esspecially because hes not medicated right now, so it's all on him to find ways to remember. Even though it's been getting better, I still do a fair amount more. I know it's not a sexist thing, but sometimes it feels that way bc of my childhood. It makes me so angry, moreso than doing more of the chores.   I'm moreso venting bc I dont want to discourage him when hes improving. Anyone else perceive the chore imbalance as sexist even though you KNOW it's due to ADHD?

One of those things is reminding him of things he needs to do or when he needs to get up in the morning to make sure he gets to work on time.  I set my boundary and am STICKING TO IT. I am not his mother. He is not my responsibility. He has to learn to take responsibility and do things for himself.   I won't be reminding him or asking him if he called his (extremely enabling and guilting) mother on her birthday this week.  My SO made the biggest deal out of driving 15 hours (yes...15) to surprise his elderly, health fragile mother on her birthday. I didn't remind him that with his line of work (he is a physicians assistant in a busy hospital) that maybe traveling during a pandemic to hot spot areas while living in a hot spot and seeing up to 7 positive COVID patients per day was a bad idea. SO's idea was completely impulsive, and while it came from a good place, not a good idea when you have an elderly mother and 2 small children at home with a F/T working spouse the week before Christmas. "But she would love it!" he said. Yes, she would. Would she love the potential exposure? Would I or the kids love him up and leaving during a pandemic that stretches us all thin right before the holidays? There was zero concern for childcare or anyone's health-it was what he wanted to do. It took his father and brother telling him NO and giving him the reasons why to deter him. The over under on him forgetting to even call her is relatively high considering he makes no effort to do more than send a few texts or sometimes call his family, however I've always been accused of being isolating. (It is never his fault. Nothing ever is and if he is told his impulsive ideas or situations that he has responsibility in are negative, defeatism, self-loathing, etc come pouring out.)  Thursday night he was up late working on a few things (good!) and at bed time asked me to make sure he was awake early so he would have time to shower and get to the hospital clinic in time to see his 7 a.m. patient. I looked at him and said "No, you can do that yourself." When I say he got very angry and compartmentalized...ohhhhh boy. It literally turned him from being tired and ready for bed to lying awake for God knows how long because I fell asleep. The next morning he was distant, cold, and said very few words and gave me the most insincere hug. So I essentially was being punished for making him take responsibility.   I do not care. Do the work or don't but I cannot parent this 40-something man anymore and refuse. I am not going to change him and don't seek to do so. If he wants behavior therapy and a meds adjustment, he needs to see the value in it and do it for himself. The issue being is he thinks things are fine and that this is as good as it gets. He doesn't get it. Everything is an insult or attack. He buries the resentment and keeps shuffling along.   I'm holding my ground.

That’s a big deal because he goes from one place straight to work every Tuesday. He had to run home in a panic last week.   This morning, he was leaving and said goodbye and was like “I remembered my boots this time!”   Later I saw his lunch bag, full of food, on the floor, where his boots go. That’s ADHD folks!

This is my first ever post, but I've felt really validated reading through everyone's experiences, and wanted to share a phone app that has been good for my bf and myself.  My co-habitating partner was diagnosed with ADHD as an adolescent (which I think was a huge blessing) and is medicated. In a lot of ways, after 5 months of quarantining together in a small apartment, the stressors in our relationship were amplified. Without diving in too much, a lot of the tension in our relationship came from the fact that I didn't feel heard in casual conversation, and his frequent distraction would leave me feeling lonely and disinteresting.   Anyways, we both downloaded something called "Love Nudge" and I think it's been good for us. It's an application that we both have on our phone and our accounts are somehow linked. You start out by both taking a quiz on your love language, which is a fun little exploration. But the main feature that I'm grateful for is you can update your "Love Tank" percentage (I know, a little hokey). When I decrease my number, he gets a notification on his phone. This is a way of letting him know that I'm feeling a little ignored, or lonely, or whatever without having to go find him and start a familiar conversation. You can also set it up to remind you to like hold hands, or go for a walk together, or do something that reinforces your needs.  Basically, it's a focused way to just give him a little update on whether or not my needs are being met without launching into it. And it lets me know if he's getting what he needs from me, too.  Anyways, I hope this is useful to someone!  tldr: An app called "Love Nudge" has given my ADHD partner and I an easy, focused way to let the other know if we are getting what we need in the relationship.

This may be useful to those of you with medicated partners, and it may even provide explanations or answers to things you didn’t know you wanted the answer for.    **What happens when you stop drinking enough?**  In short, you become dehydrated and will experience symptoms such as feeling tired or dizzy. The symptoms increase in severity the more dehydrated you become, eventually resulting in fits and seizures. Symptoms that might sound familiar, based on the posts in this sub, are increased irritability, confusion, lethargy and poor sleep.   Normally you would experience feeling thirsty before you experience any symptoms of dehydration. However, some people might forget to drink periodically until they begin to feel mild symptoms of dehydration, such as a dry mouth, before they remember to drink something. This especially prevalent for those people diagnosed with inattentive type ADHD for example.   **ADHD Medication**  ADHD medication is designed to alleviate the symptoms of ADHD, generally aimed at improving attentiveness. A side effect of this is that those people taking ADHD medication become less distractible or impulsive, meaning they may not allow the feeling of thirst, hunger, or the need to go to the bathroom, distract them from their current task. Meaning they will reduce their rate of water intake, possibly completely unaware of their increasingly severe symptoms of dehydration.  Some ADHD medications also act as a diuretic, reducing production of the hormone, Vasopressin, that would normally tell the kidneys to reabsorb water rather than allow it to flush through to the bladder. This results in a greater rate of water loss for those people taking ADHD medication, putting them at increased risk of dehydration.  **The knock on effect**  Most commonly prescribed stimulant medications used for treating ADHD are designed to release their dose over an extended period of time. If you aren’t sure what type your partner is taking, the following is a list of some common brands of prolonged release stimulant medication:   · *Concerta Xl*  · *Adderal XR*  · *Ritalin LA*  · *Daytrana*  · *Focalin XR*  · *Quillivant XR*  · *Vyvanse*  · *Metadate CD*  In general, these medications are designed to release their dose over 6 to 12 hours, however, due to how these interact with the body, the durations specified by the manufacturer will vary between patients. Each manufacturer will have their own, often patented, mechanism for how each drug achieves the prolonged release. Unless the drug is administered by anything other than orally, they generally rely on the mechanism of ***Osmosis*** and ***Diffusion*** to function.  The drugs “payload” will be released as it passes through the digestive tract. [Osmosis](https://o.quizlet.com/6exhTo-2j7S8be7v57NQgw_b.png), in this instance, is the movement of water, through a semi-permeable membrane (the drugs capsule), from a low concentration solution (the digestive tract), to a higher concentration solution (inside the drug capsule).   [Diffusion](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Diffusion.svg) on the other hand, is the movement of molecules in solution, moving from an area of high concentration *(inside the drug*) to a an area of lower concentration (*outside the drug*).   Using [Concerta](https://drgrcevich.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/concerta.png) as an example to help explain:  1. The tablet is designed to allow water to enter the capsule via ***Osmosis.***  2. The drug contained within the capsule then dissolves into the water creating a concentrated solution  3. The drug then ***diffuses*** across the semi-permeable membrane to outside the capsule, in this case, the digestive tract.  **But what does remembering to drink periodically have anything to do with it?**  Molecules have no mind of their own and don’t know that they need to be exiting the drug capsule at a constant rate. Instead they rely on the difference in concentrations between the solutions inside the capsule, and outside the capsule, to control the rate at which the drug is released.   If you are not regularly taking on fluids, the amount of water in the digestive tract will decrease. This effectively *increases* the concentration of the solution outside the drug capsule. This has a detrimental impact on the equilibrium between the two environments and results in a lower rate of release from the drug.   ***Therefore*** you won’t be receiving the dose you should be, reducing the effectiveness of the medication.  **Neglecting hydration**   It should be noted that the blood stream and the digestive tract work the same way. The intestine is essentially a capsule containing molecules that must diffuse across the membrane of the intestine and into the blood stream. Whilst this is aided by [active transport/facilitated diffusion](http://www.phschool.com/science/biology_place/biocoach/biomembrane1/glucose.html), it relies heavily on diffusion as well.  You may notice your partner regularly neglects or forgets to maintain a healthy level of hydration (*and this also applies to short acting medications)*, only to later realise and drink a large amount of water because they “are really thirsty”… (sound familiar?) By suddenly introducing more water in to the digestive tract, you are diluting the solution and reducing the concentration of the drug in the digestive tract.   As a result, it is possible the concentration of the drug within your blood stream may eventually equal, or exceed, that of the concentration within the digestive tract. This means the drug in the digestive tract has nowhere to go because both solutions are of equal concentration.   In extreme cases of dehydration, molecules start moving from the blood stream back in to the digestive tract even though you are drinking and trying to rehydrate. If this is the case, I would expect you to be in A&E and taking some form of oral rehydration solution.   **Tips for ADHDers to help remember to drink**  We all know reminders don’t work, nor do apps designed to keep track of your water consumption. Visual reminders work best so here goes:  1. Get yourself a clear water bottle that you know the volume of, and keep it at your workstation. The visual reminder of a bottle full of water should provide a visual reminder to drink. *Hint: most bottles will be around* *500ml/1pint or 1 litre/2 pints. Go for a bigger one if refilling it is too much effort.*  2. Find out how much you *should* be drinking each day and aim for that. *ToolTip:* [*Here is a calculator that does it for you.*](https://www.hydrationforhealth.com/en/hydration-tools/hydration-calculator/)  3. Set yourself a goal to drink half of that amount by lunch time, and again by bed time. Using the number of bottles it takes to make up the volume. ***PRO-Tip (Pros only): Get yourself one of*** [***these***](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Water-Bottle-Straw-Hydrate-Motivational/dp/B071GNKBV8/ref=asc_df_B071GNKBV8/?tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=214318306971&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=3454650125099271383&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1006598&hvtargid=pla-625646246632&psc=1) ***and hit two birds with one stone!***   **Thanks for reading, happy to answer any questions you might have in the comments.**   *Source: BSc Biochemistry and MSc Chemistry at University of Leeds.

I'm not great at dealing with it when things deviate substantially from my plans, but he's completely unfazed by such setbacks (and really good at correcting from them) because he's had so much practice with his own plans getting derailed by ADHD behaviors.   I also appreciate the way his rapid context switching lets him scan hundreds of news articles, and he passes along the ones that he thinks will interest me, so I get to find out about cool stuff I might never have discovered otherwise. He can skim a huge volume of information without getting stuck in it, because his attention moves on so easily to the next thing, whereas I tend to try to read one article at a time and thus don't expose myself to nearly as many.

a6064742d3a1ead19d253d3ecc1f5b43537c65b83faa3305b84227dbeb20ef5e;;;Offering insight into behavioral components of ADHD;;;Background: I want to offer some insight into behavioral aspects of ADHD as a DX medicated person whose meds are working well (after much trial and error).  In my experience, the behavioral components (impulsivity, forgetfulness, failure in gauging tasks, time blindness, perseverance, etc.) of ADHD can be mitigated by some coping mechanisms, but need medications to REALLY get it under control.  My reasoning is this: Every time I’m on my meds, I start to think that maybe I can keep up without my meds. I focus on my work, clean up after myself, do my chores, go to sleep on time, and generally have my life together. After all, what’s so hard about them? I think to myself. It’s not fucking hard to go to sleep on time. No one likes doing the dishes, but normal people put up with it. I shouldn’t rely on my medication to do basic tasks in life.  But here’s the thing. Work still sucks on meds. I still hate doing the dishes, and cleaning up after myself, and doing all the administrative tasks like renewing my license and booking doctor’s appointments. BUT, when I’m medicated, it’s much easier to “put up with things that I don’t like to do”. It’s easier to get up and do the dishes, take a shower, do the laundry, fold them. I don’t enjoy those tasks, and I may procrastinate even when I’m medicated, but ultimately I get them done. Why?  I have been thinking about the above phenomenon for a long time and why it is so much easier to do everyday tasks when I’m medicated. What is it about dopamine that makes me actually start and complete all those boring tasks?  I’ve concluded that it comes down to time blindness. When I’m off meds, I hyperfixate("hyperfocus") on a task and have no gauge of the passing time. I begin drawing on a notebook and 4 hours have passed, but it feels like an hour max. The result is that I feel like I really don’t have enough time in my day to do things in general. 24 hours feels more like 6 hours. Doing chores feels extra dreadful and overwhelming because I feel like I don’t even have enough time to do things I love. As a result, chores become so low on my mental priority list that I often forget them entirely.  In contrast, when I’m medicated, my time blindness is gone and I feel like I have so much more time to complete things. I can get all the chores done and STILL have time to work on things I love for a reasonable time. This is one of the reasons that I began taking medications on the weekends (I used to skip them on the weekends to reduce tolerance). The weekends I spent unmedicated just went by so fast that it almost felt like I didn’t get enough rest, and the result was that I was very groggy on Mondays. ADHD does not stop on the weekends, and I actually found that I felt more refreshed/recharged the following week when I did take my meds on the weekend.  In addition I found that symptoms such as impulsivity and forgetfulness are incredibly difficult to control when unmedicated. It is somewhat manageable using coping mechanisms, such as setting reminders/restrictions for yourself. But ultimately taking medication has been the most effective and straightforward way to treat it, with very little effort on my part (unlike doing chores, which did require quite a lot of effort on top of the meds).  One thing to note is that when meds wear off, symptoms do come back. So often in the evenings, when your partner comes back from work, ADHD symptoms are less controlled. For instance, I used to make impulsive purchases quite often and wondered why I was still doing it even when I took my meds every day. I began tracking my habits and found out that my impulsive shopping very often happened between 10pm and 2am. I take Adderall XR around 9am in the morning, which is supposed to last around 12 hours. Suddenly everything made so much sense. For this reason I personally feel like taking longer-acting medications such as Adderall XR or Vyvanse would be the best choice, if you want to treat the symptoms consistently.  Of course, YMMV.

No it’s not my job, but I can’t just snap my fingers and stop caring about their well being, move on with my life, and shrug my shoulders at the thought of their lives falling apart without anyone to lean on.   Obviously I may be biased because my partner is a good human with no anger issues or negative feelings towards me in any circumstance, but I don’t think any of us care about our partners any less, and that’s why a lot of us don’t leave.   I also wince at the thought of my partner meeting someone who doesn’t understand adhd at all and therefore could become verbally or physically abusive towards them when they make a mistake, because I know they would be too down on themselves to leave. They would just take it because they would feel like they deserve it, and that breaks my heart.   No that’s not my responsibility to worry about, but when you love someone I don’t think you have a choice in your worries anymore.

I go from spouse, friend, lover, to roommate in a matter of hours. Couple that with my inability to express my wants without guilt (thanks religious upbringing! I am in therapy and working hard on this) and it’s...not great.   We’ve made such strides this year in our connection, but the hyper fixation kills me every time. It gets to where I just stop considering them in how I manage my time because they do the same when they get like this, so what’s the point? Why bother asking when they’ll be home, why let them know where I’m going, when I’ll be back. Odds are they won’t even notice anyways.   I’ve already been informed that I’ll be alone all day tomorrow as they go chase the new thing. I’m not comfortable spending time indoors with friends (pandemic) and it’s January so I guess I’ll sleep in, work on my hobby until I’m bored then wait for it to be dark so I can work on a bottle of wine. I enjoy my own company but sometimes these phases make me wonder why we’re married if their attraction/affection with me is so cyclical.   What’s worse is when they realize they haven’t made eye contact with me in a week, and their solution to spending time is to...sit on the same couch I’ve been sitting on while I wait for them to be done with the shiny thing all week. No talking, just tv. No board game or puzzle to keep us interacting (I have expressed this want directly and it doesn’t happen).   I guess I’m just feeling sorry for myself. We live far away from family, and my closest friends. I don’t want to bother them with this woe is me. But I’m sad. I hate getting picked last all the time in my own relationship, but not in a ‘valid’, ‘they’re cheating’ way. Just the slow, methodical separation that adhd causes.

I am focusing on the activities that affect my life and letting him realize he needs to figure out a better way to remember his own schedule. I am feeling guilty and just wanted to post here since I'm sure someone out there can relate. I just helped him start a new planner app, he's got home automation he can use, he can use a paper notebook. He has many resources available to him. I feel that my assistance has been taken for granted and barely appreciated. In fact he decides randomly that I am controlling him vs helping him control himself. I'm tired of it and rather than resent being overwhelmed I've just given this task back. I just wish I didn't feel guilty but he is a grown ass man and he can do this himself. How did you cope with a transition to handing more responsibility back to your partner? I'm trying to get out of the parent child dynamic. He's not good at collaboration so I can't plan with him a method to take over his stuff. He becomes super prickly and cranky when I try to have a problem solving conversation. I am tired. So I just backed away.

db7a4a7c5cb3947f0d45449ccb7ad03e66f3efda05d20979f8bb75d53f34f895;;;Opinion: The widespread notion that we need to adjust to our adhd partners and meet them where they are is doing more harm than good for all involved.;;;I’m going to save my breath on the common complaint that we all have where it affects us personally. How we adapt in our home, relationship, etc. In addition to all that, I think this mentality of meeting them where they are is harmful in more ways even to the adhd partner themselves.   My husband (dx) hasn’t been able to hold a job for more than 6 months at a time. He’s at his current company for a bit over 4 months. He likes his employer, but up until last week he was “working” from home (bare minimum effort, playing video games). Last week he got a promotion. Similar work, higher pay, requires coming into the office a few times a week. All hell broke loose. What should be celebrated is somehow a huge issue.   Today, after one week of the new position, he met with his boss to tell him he wants to go back to the other team. His boss said no. So now he’s still at work, all mad, and texting me telling me that if he doesn’t get demoted he will “force his hand by not doing any work at all” (his words). I told him if he does that he will lose his job. He doesn’t care.   I’m stressed as hell. I’m still not back at work. The lack of stability is stressful. His rage from the situation is stressful. And I can’t help but think about how people with adhd are so used to getting what they want and people bending over backwards for them that they can’t be told no. They can’t adjust even in situations like work where you NEED to adapt to keep a roof over your head. No, the delusion is that if they don’t get what they want the first time, they will try to manipulate it into happening.  Adhd doesn’t just exist in a bubble at home. Society setting expectations for us to step in where they can’t just enables it in other settings. I wish this wasn’t the norm.

NT partners desperately want to know if something is "just part of ADHD" and DX individuals want to prevent any negative correlation with their disorder.  The bottom line is - the *WHY* doesn't matter. It is a reasonable expectation to be treated fairly and with consideration to your own health and wellbeing in *every* relationship regardless of contributing factors.  Attempting to draw a hard distinction between these factors is not helpful to anyone. Policing what might or might not be related to ADHD doesn't change the situation many find themselves in with their DX partners.  What does help is providing the community with tools to recognize patterns.  Today's post will explore examples of the more subtle, emotionally/psychologically manipulative behaviors that someone might experience. Many of these are daily interactions that may leave you feeling confused, frustrated and mistreated but struggling to pinpoint why.  https://preview.redd.it/lj5z580hpy761.png?width=529&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e34294ab640298a8d7f1a966cb3389466211bd2  https://preview.redd.it/azmmrywmpy761.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=673ce3f46de3d6c9eaf99fbf23a83a017784a804  https://preview.redd.it/j8r7ghltpy761.png?width=529&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7d4148cf51d5d01bdbb8e10a1f31f87883b1baf  You may be thinking to yourself "well some of these things, like excessive talking or changing the subject, just sound like expected symptoms of ADHD" and that would be true. But again, what we're looking for are patterns and intent. Displaying 1 or 2 of these traits occasionally isn't necessarily a red flag. But using ADHD as an excuse to continue harmful behaviors certainly is. Once you're able to put a name to these interactions it will help you make more informed decisions (preferably with the help of a therapist) on what steps to take moving forward.  I plan to make this a monthly series if time allows but for those who don't wish to wait feel free to browse [Abuse and Relationships.org](https://www.abuseandrelationships.org/index.html) for more examples and support.

If we can help in anyway, we want to!;;;I know a lot of people are struggling with the relationship challenges that come with ADHD. I came to this thread about a year ago looking for answers, but found a lot of the posts weren't encouraging or solutions focused.  For more context - She has ADHD, Generalized Anxiety, Rejection Sensitivity Disorder, and Depression. I found out recently I have complex PTSD causing me to be more emotionally stunted, which didn't help our match. We were on the verge of breakup 4 months ago, but we made some giant strides as a couple and individuals that has now left us happier than ever with each other since then.  If there's any way in which we can share some of that hope and joy, or help you and your loved one get over any hurdles, we'd love to help!

That doesn't excuse denial of the disorder or not taking its impact on "us" seriously, but it helps to take a step back and think about how he might be feeling and how his current reactions / behaviors could be interpreted differently when the lens shifts from the effects of ADHD on us to the root pain and struggle he's experiencing.

Eventually I have a sit down conversation where I explain the toll it’s taking. Ask him to make a schedule. He feels bad and helps out more, acting as if he’s always been this way and being hyper focused on cleanliness. Within a week or so, he will be back to only helping if I’m already in the middle cleaning something, which I hate because it gives the illusion of help without actually being helpful. A week after that I swear he stays in the bedroom until I’m done cleaning  My own behaviour is predictable too. I feel frustrated and resentful. Going through phases of polite reminders, to nagging, to just doing it myself. Thinking “I can’t do this forever”.  After talking and seeing improvements I think “oh, maybe I can, maybe I can have a happy relationship with this man. Maybe my sex drive will come back” to once again being disappointed.   Does anyone else have a similar cycle? Any suggestions for how to improve things?   By the way, undiagnosed partner, I have asked him to get diagnosed and try therapy. Nothing so far and not sure how much longer I can handle the lack of initiative. I can’t be the only one putting in the work.

I was fuming, and rushed back to shop to fix it before the business hours were up.   While in the shop and in the middle of fixing this embarrassing mess, my husband's brother (who is the best man and lives in a different country, also with adhd) calls me up to tell me his passport expired. His 13 hour flight is first thing the next day. Wedding is the day after.   I call a few people and the airport about this issue, to no avail. Get a phone call back from BIL an hour later, saying he read the wrong date on his passport (date of issue, not date of expiry). So he's all packed and checked in on the flight.   Luckily, I was able to get married instead of committing double murders.

I’ve been looking for something like this for years!!!   My husband is super sensitive, has zero patience/ is easily frustrated which escalated into anger real fast, and he’s just an asshole.   We’ve been together for 7 yrs (married for 3) and it’s not like I didn’t know this from day one. But it’s gotten worse over the years.   Our biggest marriage problem is miscommunication. We REALLY suck at communicating with each other..   I can’t think of a specific example bc there are so many but here is a typical cycle:   I say something, he “hears” something different or assumes my intention is something different. He gets upset at me about what he assumed. I get annoyed bc (yes he’s doing it again!) and I get defensive. He then continues to escalate things, is super passive aggressive, starts to act like an ass and say mean things. He then starts the self hatred/ self loathing/ pity party. (This continues for the rest of the day or night) His bad mood just continues and literally spills onto everything. EVERYTHING. I just avoid him for the night bc I just don’t wanna be around him or deal with him. Next day he says sorry.   Does this happen with anyone else?

When I read comments from other Partners, they vent/complain and then follow up with the reasons they love their partner. I was hoping to hear more of those loving reasons. I'm forgetting why I'm in this relationship and I'm hoping hearing about the love you have for your partner will help me look deeper.

You probably have a better more efficient way to do it. That’s okay. They don’t want your help. They didn’t ask. You suggested once. They shot it down. Let it go lol if it don’t affect your wallet or your relationship, and it won’t matter in 5 days, 5 months, five years, just let it go.   I have to remind myself of this. I grew up with a dad that owned his own business and regularly said things like “time is money” which he would apply to outside of work, just in regular life. I’m always looking for efficient ways to do everything. So sometimes, the way my husband does things dives me absolutely insane because it’s Willy nilly all over the place. Why zig zag to get the thing done when you can take a straight line?? The answer is...who cares as long as it gets done? Lol  Thanks for letting me work out my control issues here 😂😂😂

But what did he do?;;;I posted this as a comment somewhere else but I really wanted to just share this with you all:  He saw that I was putting a lot of effort into some big batches of apple butter. Because of my joint pain, we got me a crank style apple peeler online, and it was just laughably crap. He helped me try to fit these apples on this dang thing without chopping our respective fingers off and it was both dumb and funny.   So he went online and ordered me a top notch fancy ass corer/slicer/peeler/spiralizer attachment for my Kitchenaid mixer. It arrived just in time for my second big batch, and it worked like a charm. We had so much fun turning this machine on and watching it core/peel/slice all these apples like magic.  So, did he plan on the perfect gift for me ahead of time? No, he didn't.   But what he did do was notice my struggles, address and respond to them in a way I wouldn't have thought of, used his ADHD superpowers to pull some fantastic strings, and showed up for me exactly when I needed him to, exactly the way I needed him to, and helped me accomplish a task I wouldn't have been able to finish on my own.   Sometimes we forget that our partners don't always show love the way we expect, but sometimes that's the exact type of love we need <3

We all know that ADHD is an explanation, not an excuse. But many of us struggle to find the line between accommodating legitimate deficits and simply accepting disrespectful behavior.  A few examples of behavior that should never be tolerated might be:  * Violent outbursts * Name calling * Spending time on interests **instead** of time with partner (there has to be balance and compromise, hyperfocus is not an excuse for neglect) * Refusal to consider partner's needs and feelings once they have been clearly addressed * Deflection, projection, gaslighting, lying, triangulation etc * Refusal to implement available self-management tools i.e. timers, clocks, calendars, apps * Refusal of any treatment option ie medication, therapy, coaching, couples counselling and so on  Examples of areas where you could expect to make reasonable accommodations:  * Time management * Forgetfulness * Emotional lability  (note: not an excuse for emotional abuse) * Inattentiveness * Impulsivity   Here is where you decide what you will and will not accept & what your needs in a relationship are  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/u3dkfoz6ej151.png?width=1057&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fb189054ba59bff1956e590ccca3a0989d69dca  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/l3votc3bej151.png?width=1029&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfb4af4ea513231c919e37bf3b80ff4aae04b17a  These excerpts are taken from [CHADD](https://chadd.org/attention-article/dont-give-up-dont-give-in-survival-skills-for-the-non-adhd-partner/) but there are plenty of other resources available on this subject. I think it would be useful for many non-ADHD partners to ask themselves "Would I tolerate this behavior from a neurotypical partner?". And "Why am I willing to tolerate the behavior simply because my partner has ADHD?" Many of us would face similar issues in any other relationship because we have not learned how to advocate for our own needs appropriately. Expectations for being treated with consideration, compassion and respect should not vary so greatly across NT or DX relationships.  If anyone finds this information helpful I may make a follow-up post highlighting what different boundaries can look like as well as learning how your own reactions/responses can be used as a powerful tool for creating the environment you want to have.

I’m a lurker, and this week, something caught my eye. I’ve been reading some recent posts about Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD). Y’all ... it makes sense now.  My partner has diagnosed ADD, and I won’t be an armchair psychologist, but he does has some of the hallmarks of RSD: attempting to please everyone, when we discuss conflicts, he often takes it personally, saying things like “I’m worthless,” and many of our discussions end in him saying that his brain has shut down. I had no idea what that meant until now, and I’m still pretty foggy on what that feels like to him. Learning that there is a word for this and that many people with ADD and ADHD have it makes so much sense to me.  I am patient and I don’t escalate the situation. He’s never angry or violent towards me, although he does hit his own head sometimes. I do try to assure him that he isn’t worthless and try to have him stop hitting his head. I want to thank you guys for helping me learn what RSD is, and if anyone wants to share some suggestions, they’d be appreciated! I’m especially curious about how you guys handle your partners’ shutdowns. We’ve been together for 5 years but as you know, you’re constantly learning more about someone and how to work better together. I have asked that he consider going to therapy but he hasn’t made any steps towards that yet. I’m beginning to think that couples therapy could be a good idea.

We have a cleaner coming over today and so last night I had asked my husband to do the pile of dishes by the sink that we had. My work load has been lighter, so I have been taking it upon myself to handle most of the house chores. Last night, I decided that I wanted a little break so I asked my husband to handle the dishes.  Well, this morning I go around the house to do a once over and see if there's anything easy I can clean so that the cleaners can focus more on detailing rather than like...picking up dirty paper towels off the table....aaaand I notice there are still some dishes in the sink.  Not the end of the world! I can just put away the clean dishes really quickly and refill the washer.   ...I wouldn't be posting here if it wasn't a big deal. I opened the dish washer, and low and behold...dishes were just thrown in with food crusted, caked on. Dough sticking to the utensils...nothing had been even rinsed before being put in there. I found a mug with an entire TEA BAG still in it.   Now I have to redo all those dishes and hand wash whatever doesn't fit. I'm just...tired. I cried for about 5 minutes over the disrespect that I'm feeling from this. My husband came out and immediately wanted to fix it, but I just am over it and he has a lot of work to do today. I just want to ask for something to get done and have confidence that it's not going to look like someone doing chores for the first time did it the next day.

I don't know if they aren't aware of the problems in their relationships with other people, or they just don't care about them, or what, but it's very telling to me. It explains why so many of us hear them blame shift when we try to address something that is associated with the ADHD. It's honestly not on their radar as a thing that their ADHD is wreaking havoc on relationships. Has anyone else noticed this?

17401dbdeab5a6c7cee6c58fda6edd6916d7c7447ba74b5ed710a1ccd1f1847c;;;My therapist helped clarify my feelings about support;;;Last week, my ADHD partner and I had a long, difficult conversation. He felt like I wasn't being empathetic or supportive enough with all he's experiencing with his new diagnosis, and since I've been aware of the issue for years and am trying to work through my own anger and disappointment, a lot of empathy is not available at the moment.   I expressed to my therapist how frustrated I feel as a wife and partner, that I can't just put my arms around him and tell him it will be ok - because I can't muster it. She reminded me that so much of the time we've been trying to identify and work with the ADHD, I've been doing 100% of the work. I found the articles and seminars, booked the class and put it on his calendar, even found his therapists through the insurance my company provides. He's done so little so far but to feel bad for himself about all this, apologize to me as if it's intentional, and frankly, feel a lot of self-pity. She asked if he'd thought about all he's been asking of me. Planning, maintaining household and financial order, providing resources, AND empathy... and if it's even possible to give 100% of all of those things at once. I realized that no, it's not possible.   I've been backing off the mothering and reminding, letting him make his own mistakes and forget important things (as long as they weren't dangerous to the household), and he's aware that's happening but without the tools to help himself, he's not able to take full control and I know this. He's going through the steps of formal diagnosis and is already medicated, but now he has to find a therapist to work on cognitive therapy. I found that resource for him too.   She asked what I'd need in order for the frustration to take a back seat to the empathy and I told her "effort". I just want to see him find his own resources, make his own lists (that don't just affect his hobbies or interests), set timers for all the things I normally just handle because it's easier and I know it will get done, etc. and she suggested that his need for my empathy and support is equal to my need to see his effort. That took so much pressure off of me to hear, up until now I thought our house and my needs simply weren't as important as this big thing he's going through. But I'm going through it too and have been for years without him.   Because we had a good day yesterday, I'm holding onto that thought until tonight when we sit down to work on the homework for our ADHD & Marriage class, when we'll be in a place to have that exact conversation.  So I'm forgiving myself for not feeling as much empathy as he wishes I would, and reminding myself that - I hope - this is just a really rough start to a very long process.
1b35696bd8533a1dea3183af237f1b3af40380b91a50630bc62fbedb6bde87de;;;We bought a fixer-upper, and it's been a disaster;;;Long-time lurker, first-time poster. Apologies if I make any formatting or posting mistakes!  My husband (36M, DX, medicated) and I have no shortage of issues (which I'm learning is pretty typical), but currently one shows up over and over again. A few years ago, we bought a pretty old house that needed lots of work. My husband used to work in construction and insisted that he would do a lot of the renovations himself. As I'm sure most of you can already tell, that didn't end up happening.   There are half-finished projects EVERYWHERE. Like, our kitchen faucet broke three years ago, there are giant holes in the doors leading to the outside, the basement floods every time it rains. The list goes on and on.  I spent literal years reminding, cajoling, and begging for him to work on these projects. I made lists, organized supplies, put together calendars, and did all of the "helpful" things he asked me to. Even just a little progress would have meant so much. He found all of the time and attention in the world for his hobbies, but our home never made the cut. He got so insulted every time I suggested we just hire someone, saying that was a stupid waste of time and money and that he would get to it "when he had time" or was "less overwhelmed".   When COVID-19 meant we started sheltering in place, it became too much. There are tools and live wires all over the place; it just wasn't safe. I got so sick of living in a construction zone that I started to do a lot of the projects myself. To be clear, I have absolutely zero background in this kind of stuff. But I read and researched a lot, I watched a lot of YouTube tutorials, and I was able to figure out what to do on some of the smaller projects. After all of these years, it feels AMAZING to finally start checking things off the list!   But my husband is a wreck over it. Every time I finish something myself, he launches into the same diatribe about how me doing this makes him feel like a fuckup. I obviously hate that he feels that way, but I'm starting to really lose patience for this cycle. Not only do I work a full-time job, do almost all of the normal household tasks, plus the renovations all by myself, but I'm feeling pressure to apologize for making him feel bad!   I don't know what to do. My expectations for his participation are pretty much nonexistent at this point, but I'm not going to wait for him forever. I guess I could just swallow my pride and "apologize", but that feels ridiculous. I understand that his ADHD makes tasks like this challenging, but soothing his hurt ego feels patronizing.  Does anyone have any experience with stuff like this? Is there a pathway forward that I'm just not seeing? To be clear, these projects are getting done whether he helps me or not - I just don't know how to get him to emotionally self-regulate a little bit! Thank you so much.
4dae3e360c217bfa0193ec571e1552769fea2486a5046466b6a738025916dbca;;;I have ADHD, this is how we manage to massively improve my partner's quality of life;;;... and mine too.  I always had ADHD but got diagnosed only last year at 38 years old and I take medication. I'm a man, my partner is a man as well, we live together for 9 years and got married 2 years ago.  The diagnostic in itself helped a lot. I understood how my brain works, my husband realised that I was not disrespectful or immature. It really helped decrease guilt and resentment for both of us.  The treatment helped for our relationship as well, I can finally give him most of my attention when he's talking to me.  But there is still one recurrent problem: my monologues. This is how we solved it.  Too many things are happening in my head and I actually enjoy having those prolific thoughts, it's even part of what he loves in me: curiosity, creativity, enthusiasm, sincere naive amazement about so many things... but I need to constantly empty my brain of those thoughts like if I needed to make room for more, and I tend to do it in his hears.  Solutions:  * Awareness: Acknowledging that I have that need helped me to learned to make the difference between what I really want to share with him because I know that it's a topic that he will be interested in, and what I actually just need to vent out. The latter is recognizable by my interest in his feedback. Do I care about what he will have to say about this?  Or am I just hoping that he will get as enthusiast as I am about learning about this topic but it will probably not be the case? * Meditation: mindfulness is helping me a lot to note what I'm doing and take control, but also to unload those thoughts. * Other Alternative ways to empty my brain: having walks recording memo voice notes on my phone. I heard about people who have ADHD friends and willingly do that by talking with each other. * but the most important of all, the one that had the biggest impact on the quality of life of both of us, but especially his, is **BLUNT REMINDERS**.  When I start a monologue, I'm listening to my own voice. If the reminder is not obvious enough, it does not work so much. It really needs to be a blunt, very direct statement. The blunter, the better.  A big condition for this to work is CONSENT. Se we did that in three steps:  1. explain how it makes us feel, so we can both have empathy for each other.    1. He feels exhausted when I repetitively do monologues. He also has a lot to share with me and feels like my monologues are taking all the space. He sometimes needs silence to think or to rest. It's overwhelming and exhausting. He feels used as a tool. The monologues do not feel like sharing anyway because it's a one-way conversation. But at the same time, he also cares a lot about me, and know that I need it and he is afraid to offend me or hurt my feelings. Also, I don't always accept easily when he needs a break, because it makes me feel rejected and he finds it unfair, but at the same time, he has compassion because he hates to make me feel rejected.    2. I feel the need to vent my thoughts, I want to share everything that I get excited about in the hope to share the excitement. When I do it, I typically have a kind of second thought effect just after, which makes me feel like shit because I realise that I lost control again and it makes me feel like I'm not an interesting person, because I talk way too much. 2. Accept that both our well being matter.    1. He should not sacrifice his own sanity and well-being for me. It's normal to be overwhelmed, and to need to say "STOP!". It's OK to not always be in the mood for patience and diplomacy. He is allowed to be fed-up and to need a break. He should not feel guilty about that. His thoughts are as important as mines. He is entitled to my attention, he deserve it and can claim it when he needs to talk. It's also OK to not always be able to help me. Its should be both ways, I also have to help him.    2. I should not be ashamed of my need to unload my thought, I'm not doing it because I don't care about him. I'm not selfish. It's not my fault. Even if I have alternative ways to cope with that need, it's OK to sometimes fail to keep the control. I should not feel guilty when it's happening, it's OK to need help to notice/realize when it's happening. 3. Agree on the blunt reminders    1. He's allowed to stop me anytime in a very blunt way. The bluntness is helpful. But even if it was not helpful, he's allowed to not be in the mood. There is no resentment to my lack of control, nor fear to offend me.    2. I commit to not be offended, there is no resentment to the bluntness, nor guilt for the lack of control. I know that he loves me and that he cares about my well-being as much as I care about his.  Here are a few examples of blunt reminders depending on my partner's mood of the moment:  * "Hey, hey, STOP. you talk too much. I'm tired, it's not nice" * "Honey, your word count for today is nearly over, it's my turn to talk now" * "Hey honey, you're literally vomiting your thoughts in my face right now, and that's not cool. I'm not enjoying it" * "Stop, you're doing it again. Stop and listen to your breath for a minute, think about what you really want to SHARE with me and if it really cannot wait, I will give you 2 more minutes of my attention, but after that, I want to have some me-time, OK?" * "Hey, I love you, but what about you shut the f\*ck up right now and give me a long silent hug? I need that" * "OK, you entered in monologue mode, is there anything that I really need to know? I don't necessarily need to be alone or anything, but stop talking at me and start talking with me" * \[Make a "call for time-out" hand signal\] and \[leave the room\] or \[take his coat and go for walk without saying a word\].  Not only it improved both our quality of life, but it also decreased the recurrence of the monologues. Because most of the time I cannot unload my thoughts that way anymore, my brain got used to using the alternative ways in priority.  Also, my husband feel more respected (it feels good to share how he feels and that I'm not offended). and understood, I also feel understood and we both feel more loved than ever.  tl:dr: I often enter in monologue mode, it's exhausting for my partner. We agreed that he can bluntly stop me and I will not be offended. The blunter, the better. That symptom decreased and even when it still happens, the bluntness helps both of us. We are both much happier.

My spouse (Dx, Meds) has been in therapy for years, now has a med routine that is actually mostly working! I should be thrilled, right? By every metric I ever set, things are “better”.  But I’ve got to say that I’m just exhausted.  If this had happened 15 yrs ago, or 10 yrs ago, or even 5...but at this point all I can say is good luck, hun- I’m happy for you but I’m no longer interested.  I don’t know if I even have the space to be guilty about it- I’ve burned all that fuel on being angst full about our drama (see all my previous posts ::sigh::) So yeah- now that he’s in a functional space, I’m preparing for a divorce.  Anyone else finally get out when things were “good”?

In fact, sometimes it just never happens ever.   As the title says, I feel like I have to just not trust them when they say “soon” or “in a bit” or any related phrase.   I have been working towards not taking it personally when I feel forgotten or ignored, but it’s making me sad that now I feel like I can’t trust what my partner is saying. I don’t want to continue feeling like this, but I don’t know how else to feel so that I can also protect myself and not continuously feel disappointed or forgotten.

I feel like I can't express any less-than-blissful emotions without him immediately getting defensive and angry that I'm "blaming him." I feel like I have to either constantly walk on eggshells around him (which means I have no mental rest in my own home) or else deal with being snapped at and made out to be the bad guy because I sighed wrong.  If it was anyone else, I would think they were doing on purpose as a form of passive-aggressive control.

I have always had a hard time talking to friends and family about my relationship with my ADHD husband, they don't seem to understand. This community really has helped me feel heard and not alone.

I will occasionally chat with an online friend but they also have adhd and I tend to avoid them because of it even though they are a wonderful friend.   Because of this I find myself pondering about what it would feel like to speak with a non adhd human.. Imagining having a conversation or spending time with someone who would remember what I say and be fully present in the moment seems impossible to me.   Also someone who follows through and is able to be trusted to handle small tasks without guidance or reminders.. that genuinely does not feel real to my brain. I think if I had an interaction like that I might end up bursting into tears.   Does anyone else feel this way? It’s part of the reason I hold back from leaving sometimes. The idea of anyone I pursue not having adhd just seems fully impossible and I love my partner’s personality and our connection too much for the risk to feel worth it.
4eb30c831fc78835804d6d6d168e6573adcfc1f3b1c3812d489b920e88fd9eda;;;I can’t do it anymore.;;;The pandemic has been affecting everyone. My mental health is not great and I’ve been feeling depressed. I’m far away from my family and I feel incredibly guilty. I realise this makes me very sensitive and there is a risk of overreacting. But yesterday I reached a breaking point and I don’t know how to proceed.   I spoke to my partner (diagnosed with DX) about three weeks ago about getting something sent over from his parents who live in the same country but many hours away. It’s winter equipment that we’d been talking about wanting here for months. Over the past few weeks every couple of days I would ask if he had spoken to his dad about sending it here. As you can imagine he would avoid giving a direct answer. He had reached out and fair enough his dad didn’t seem to sense any urgency.   Yesterday I said look it’s been three weeks, last thing you heard was your dad saying he hadn’t sent the stuff yet. Could you please call him and ask if there are any issues? Winter is coming, my vacation is coming, life is very restricted as it is and I’d love to have the gear here.   He got defensive, accused me of pressuring him, why was I so pushy. And I just lost it. I felt tears coming and I said that I was feeling like shit 90 % of the time and that I was struggling. And all I was asking for was taking care of having the equipment shipped (that he wants here too) and I said why does it take three weeks and me following up 8 times to get this sorted.   I left the room and apparently he organised for the gear to be shipped today as his dad sent the tracking number.   Why does it always have to come to this? Why do I have to be almost at a breaking point for my partner to do what he has said he would do for weeks. It is so hard and I don’t know how much more of this I can take.   He’s unmedicated and he does not want to try medication because he had horrible side effects (depression) from Adderall and Ritalin throughout his youth.   I‘m just at a loss. I understand that it’s a tough time for everyone and that Covid is a struggle for so many relationships. But I don’t know how to make this easier for either of us.

Not med) acted a fool during the admit appt this morning- maybe he was trying to cheer me up or avoiding his own feels. It was embarassing! He wasn't wearing undies, and started getting a chub, jokingly rubbed it up on me. Dude....inappropriate!! Sent me a snapchat of him pissing in a bush next to the hospital while I was waiting to see the gyny. Giggling like a schoolgirl. I told him he's frucking terrible and a pest and to just go and leave me be for today! After the procedure he came for 10 min and announced "I have to poo and shower, Im gunna go home and come straight back". 2 HOURS later, I get a text of Im ready yet. I have been discharged and ready for 30 min at this point. Um, you said you were coming straight back dude. In a nutshell folks, you gotta be your OWN support person, useless as tits on a bull! To all the young players in early relationships with adhd men....THIS is the reality. They don't "change", it doesn't get better, in fact as life gets more complicated with bills, children and work, its infinitely HARDER. GOOD LUCK OUT THERE PEEPS LOL
38f6ddc9e6f24c412d85946d99155b419219e19bba0904a5988fe72cceaffaa1;;;I’m a DX woman;;;I wanted to give some insight into the ADHD partner. So here it goes...  I’m (27/dx) a trainee counsellor and unemployed person. When in the room with my clients, or ANYONE, I am the most attentive, curious person you will have met. That magnetic element of connection is a strong area of hyperfocus for me. But when I’m not in the room with them? It’s out of sight, out of mind. It is no reflection on my degree of love or care, but imagine those feelings are, like a flip book, flipped to the back of my mind while the next page underneath is now the only thing I see and act on. Sometimes that next page is something productive that a neurotypical person would do next, but usually it’s like,  spending hours and hours looking for my ultimate novelty bag on AliExpress because I just accidentally saw one and now I can’t stop scrolling and nothing else matters to me right then. It would be funny if it wasn’t so sad. And let me say, since being medicated, this is only MORE of a risk - because my meds help my focus but don’t tell me what to focus on so I get even MORE stuck doing the wrong thing unless interrupted. Then when that page with my feelings for someone I love flips back up, I feel just the same way as when I left off and have the impetus to act on it.  I rarely even get to choose what page is next in the flip book, and I certainly don’t get to flip through the book and prioritise and reorder the pages. Even if I tried to, my brain is mostly incapable of recognising how to rate the priority of any one thing from the next. I can know it cognitively and emotionally that, say for instance, answering your text from last month is more important than watching a 5 hour long walkthrough of a walking simulator video game I’ve never even played to get to know the intimate relations of all the characters to each other just because I saw one comment about it that made me curious and then BAM my evening is wasted on another useless rabbit hole I can’t look away from. But due the curiosity of the new thing eclipses and everything else falls away. Out of sight, out of mind. That is the rule.  It’s like, I will have washing up in my sink for a WEEK but bc of my ADHD brain, I see *past* the washing up. It has become part of the background, and no longer exists as something to alert my brain. Imagine it like when you look at something specific in the room you are in - while you look at something specific, everything around it kind of melds together in that moment, and becomes a “whole” with less defined lines around each object, because you have razor sharp focus on the one object. This is my brain on EVERYTHING. My life is a room where instead of seeing all the separate elements as what they are, separate parts that make a whole, I see the room in soft focus, except for one focused element at a time - and the focus is largely outside of my control. This means birthdays of people I love are in soft focus, it means that the things I promised I would do earlier that day are in soft focus. I might even be somewhat aware of them in my peripherals but without those clearly defined perimeters around them that stop them from becoming just a part of the background, they are at risk of becoming unnoticeable to me.  I set reminders on my phone - but because they aren’t new and interesting or randomised - they become a part of the background. I start a habit of a reminder to drink water, which sends me a notifications. On day one and two, it’s great. On day 3, I see past the notification, and no longer notice it on my phone. It’s become too normalised, and no longer captures my attention. I don’t read the notification and think “nah”, it goes off, I don’t notice what it says, I just turn it off because it’s interrupting me finding out more about the way that Pied Wagtail birds have adapted to live alongside humans and exploited our environments to get their needs met - meanwhile my washing and washing up has piled, I have assignments still due despite my uni classes ending a year ago. All I can see is how fascinating Pied Wagtails are right now.  The way that I clean is that I don’t notice what needs doing until one day I notice that I feel rubbish because my environment is a shit hole, and so I hyperfocus on cleaning for a whole day and maybe pull an all nighter. And every single time I say to myself “I will never do this again”. It’s a nightmare - I have tried a million interventions. I am now thinking I need to just accept this about myself and buy a roomba and hire a cleaner every month or two to help me keep more on top of it all. My ADHD partner doesn’t want to hire anyone to pay anyonehelp us when we move in together, because he is still in denial of the fact he can’t manage and overestimates his ability to get it done. He makes me want to claw my eyes out, so it helps me understand what you are all going through.  Every single day is a tragic tale of curiosity gone wrong. My relationships are in tatters, my placement and uni find me unreliable, I have been unemployed for over a year now and I’m struggling to complete my work for my degree. I am happy when in my little hyperfocus and devastated when I look up and see the reality of my life. The chronic underachievement, the impossibility of demonstrating reliability and consistent reachability to the people I love most, waking up to notice how my neglect of them has lead them to understandably distance from me or deprioritise me as someone important to them - but the clincher is that I love them just the same as before.  My advice to you is really to focus on your boundaries and self care. You non ADHD folks are superheros to me - you keep the world turning for all of us. Interventions that are helping me are meds - but only if I have a schedule to follow! Or as I said, I’m at risk of hyper focusing in the wrong direction. I also really benefited from counselling for 3 years. I also think that notifications are one of the best ways to remind us but they aren’t bullet proof.  You are not our micro managers, your emotional labour is so valuable and we have often failed to appreciate it appropriately. We need to take responsibility for creating systems that remind OURSELVES, and I think that getting help that outsources the tasks we suck at where possible is key for us - like getting a roomba.  Ask me anything if you like, I hope this was helpful at least. I am sorry for everything you experience due to our problems - and thank you for everything you do for your partners.
073fa2d6528a78c32e7fcb4b977a4b9ad590ae6ddf22397f925ab8682ea7bf05;;;Hi! I am another spouse who feels hopeless about her marriage.;;;I’m at my wits end. I’ve read through countless articles that claim to offer coping strategies for the spouse without ADHD. I haven’t discovered a single thing to help me cope with his ADHD. Every single one can be distilled down to, “do your best, but that’s all you get.”    Understand his symptoms so you can better empathize and see things from his point of view. Build on your partners strengths determine what they’re good at and enjoy doing around the house and set up clear agreements you each understand your responsibilities. Rediscover what you love about each other so you can rekindle that spark. Separate who your partner is from their symptoms or behaviors. Stop trying to parent your partner. Watch what you say and how you say it. Find humor in the situation.  I feel like I’ve been doing all of that for 10+ years. I’ve always been a mindful and deeply emotional person. Pregnancy seemed to permanently heighten that, and the past few years I’ve been constantly working on myself and perspective to improve my ability to stay in the present moment and be more understanding toward everyone. I’ve mostly curbed the anxiety that seemed to have developed and been exasperated by his adhd symptoms.  I understand his symptoms as best I can. I’ve devoured every scrap of information about ADHD and sent him a lot of great, validating about ADHD to help him understand his symptoms better. I know that he isn’t being inattentive or thoughtless on purpose. It isn’t easy to find the humor in him forgetting to scoop the cat littler for the 3rd time in a row and now I am cleaning up cat shit off the carpet (again) first thing when I wake up. He didn’t mean to, I get it. Ok. But what about when those sort of things keep happening? What about when I give up expecting him to do it so I add that task to my long todo list?  What do I do when he so emotionally inattentive? When the mere mention of a negative feeling is seen as an attack? When emotional validation is nonexistent? When I get thrown under the bus or disregarded because he wants so desperately to please his family even if it’s at the expense of my needs?  Sorry for the rant. All that is to say, does anyone have actual ways of coping? Or should I just start working on accepting all of this as an irrefutable reality? He’s medicated, but still trying to find the right kind. Apparently typical stimulants don’t work, his body is really quick to process them and they decrease in efficacy over time. I’m trying to be patient for all of his meds and therapy to start working, but I feel like I’m going to be waiting my whole life.  Thanks for reading, this sub has helped my struggles feel valid. 💕
7a7789a69203b323420e5e52561944e4ae7e8b46196fcc76558a3fa02dcad618;;;Therapist recommended an enlightening book that's changing how I think about my partner's ADHD;;;[The ADHD Effect on Marriage.](https://www.amazon.com/ADHD-Effect-Marriage-Understand-Relationship/dp/1886941971) I started listening to it on my commute to and from work and find myself yelling out loud, "TOTALLY!" and nodding along. It is an eye-opening explanation of how our NT brains react and respond to the ADHD brain, and has tips and tricks to work within those headspaces.  It is written largely for the co-habitating NT so I think there are other books out there that use different, maybe somewhat softer language for those with ADHD who likely already feel like they're failing their partners, spouses, themselves, etc. but for those of us who walk around wringing our hands and shaking our heads, it's good to hear that we are not alone. It also gives ways to approach talking to our partners about therapy coinciding with meds, why meds matter, and how to best encourage them about both of those things (particularly valuable for those of us with partners who won't consider meds and/or therapy).  I highly recommend it, I'm only a few chapters in and I can tell it will help how I deal with my ADHD spouse.
82e3797366b400647dd31bdf611526ccc2c67d1918f4f6ebd15f6247febafb3f;;;Perfect In their own way;;;Just thought I’d post this. I know our partners drive us insane and make us furious, but I just wanted to appreciate how amazing they can be.   How considerate and thoughtful they can be.  How much effort it takes for them to be able to do so but they do it to make us happy.  It may not seem like it but they do try but when they do it have a “good day” it makes it all worth it.  Just thought I’d remind everyone on the rough days to think of 5 amazing things there partner does that an “average” SO wouldn’t   1. Always thinking outside the box and attention to detail (helpful when I’m picking new clothes and need his advice if it works or not)  2. So unbelievable cleaver 3. How hard they try to put my thoughts first or intend to even if it doesn’t come across that way 😂 4. How dedicated they are to trying new things 5. How hard they try to submit there uni work even though it kills them to complete every piece of work  Those are just mine but feel free to share your own. Sometimes just getting outside of the negative mind set could help your relationship.
36a31d815fb0ca2eb7e694b12417dc6b4655b74e36887a22cafc2eca9ee57ef6;;;Her ADHD is tearing our marriage apart...;;;ME - non adhd MY WIFE - DX, currently off meds due to losing health insurance, but was on meds for the last year or so.  To start this off, I love my wife.  I feel horrible writing this, but i have to let my frustrations out or they are going to explode.  I have been with my wife for the last 8 years, since our early 20's.  We got married after a year of dating, and we have no kids.  I just.... I'm at the end of my rope.  She fixates intensely on a TV show, or scrolling through her phone for literally hours, while I sit at the other end of the couch - just staring off in silence.  Silence is easier than asking her "whatcha watchin?"  or "that sounds funny!  what happened?"  each time, I'm met with "just a stupid video."  and then she goes back to her phone.  I'm done trying.  She's been laid off because of covid since early april, and just found out her job no longer exists at her old workplace (they couldn't afford to keep her on payroll after the hit the business took) so now she's all defeated and depressed and doesn't have any idea of where or what shes going to do next.  I'm still working my 9-5 mon-fri and every night I come home to a dirty house while she's just sitting on the couch gaming or watching more stupid videos on her phone.  I swear she doesn't do a damn thing all day long.  The dogs are going crazy because she won't take them for a walk during the day.  She always says she will, and that she wants to get better about it, but nothing ever changes.  I finally got her to help me clean the house up a bit just just asking her to clean up the laundry in the back room, but instead of cleaning up the laundry, she started washing every wall with bleach and for the next week, the laundry was never touched, but the walls are now sparkling clean.  If I slightly disagree with her, she gets immediately upset and asks why im being so hostile - even if the conversation is about something like liking a character on a tv show.  Shell complain shes hungry, so we'll drive into to town and I'll try to treat her to dinner - but if I ask her to make a descion on where she wants to eat, she just covers her head with her hands and says she cant handle making a descion right now.  So I'm left to decide on a place to eat while she's now facing away from me and silently staring out the window - when it was her who was hungry in the first place, I was just being nice by bringing her out instead of cooking and creating more dishes.  Housework never gets done, and I feel like I'm married to a rebellious teen who doesn't want to do anything but play games or sit and watch TV.  I shouldn't have to nag her 5 times before i leave for work to PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE clean up a little bit while I'm gone.  This isn't about me expecting her to cook and clean, it's me getting fed up with the fact that i am working full time, while she collects unemployment and does LITTERALY NOTHING, other than what's interesting to her.  I can't take this, and I don't know what to do.  I'm at a complete loss.  I feel like my marriage is falling apart and I'm the only one willing to keep it glued together, but i'm so sick of being the glue of it.  Just once I'd like to come home to a clean house and some conversation that we both want to talk about, but instead the conversation we DO have is just her going on and on for hours about the TV shows she watched that day, getting mad when I try to talk, or interrupting me mid sentence.  I'm over it.
ff9bda403ee23220ca869bee0779e23db84f6a3020192799c268978706a4a7b0;;;What's the most frustrating / upsetting thing your partner has done?;;;There are many - but the #1 - (even above affairs and other terribleness) - on my daughter's 5th birthday, I planned the party, booked it, filled out the invitations, everything. I was out of town for 2 weeks prior. She was supposed to take the invitations to school and hand them out to the teacher & parents.  She never did.  The day of the party, I discovered this and frantically started calling & texting everyone I knew from her class. Sadly, everyone had other plans. My daughter's party, at a local fun house / bounce place, was just her and her older brother. She was devastated.  My wife has never owned up to this, and insists it was just too stressful to take the things to school and hand them out / follow up with a text to parents.  This is the most insidious part of all these mental challenges to me - the unintended effects on everyone else - including the *really* bad ones.
7e6e9f58d45b4d63daef4f7e6e15aa86d940427f1bd381f4026be4bfaaa4f53d;;;I’m just exhausted;;;My husband displays anger so easily. I’ll ask an innocuous question and he’ll huff, snap, and move with tense anger, like I’m doing him some horrible slight and he is just beyond aggravated with me for daring to interrupt. I get to be afraid to even say anything at all. The reaction can alarm me sometimes, if he’s particularly worked up, but mostly just feel so unfair.   What makes me most exhausted is having to prove that it even happened. I will try to calmly say, hey, I only asked you if xyz, you don’t need to respond that way. I usually get interrupted before I even finish saying this, and he’ll condescendingly/irritably/contemptuously say that that he’s not doing anything to me. The tone varies on the day, and this is the part that really launches the problems — it bothers me so much.   It’s hard to explain just how unpleasant he can be, because it’s not necessarily in what he says but in how he says it, how he embodies anger and frustration in his body and voice. It makes it hard for me to prove that I’m not just crazy when I take issue, or ask him to change his demeanor.  I would say most of our fight aren’t about even the irritable response, but center instead on my frustration trying to even get acknowledgement that something did actually happen. I feel like all I’m ever saying is either to say that he can’t talk to me that way, or crying/screaming because he won’t even acknowledge that he did.   I’m so sick of saying that I don’t want to be spoken to this way. I’m so sick of saying something has to change.  We just had this exact thing play out in the middle of the day, and I just fucking snapped. I was ugly, I was screaming. Every time I was just trying to get through one sentence he would interrupt to tell me I was being crazy, give me a “whatabout” in regards to his behavior when I’m clearly the one being inappropriate. I’m not proud of it, but with each interruption I would only scream more, lose control more — just so fucking desperate to even finish what I was saying without being interrupted and invalidated.  Things escalated and escalated and escalated, me more and more desperate to just have him acknowledge that he reacted with anger to a simple question, him interrupting to demean me or paint me as off the rails or contemptuously ask, “Are you aware that other people in your life might sigh in your presence?” as if that’s what I was upset about. He even threw in a, “are you getting your period?”  And he’s right, I wasn’t behaving calmly. But I genuinely have no more bandwidth to not just be spoken to that way, but to be told that I’m going psycho over “breathing sounds” or “blinking” — when I swear to god *I swear to god* that is NOT how he was comporting himself.   I told him he had to get meds or get therapy but of course because I was positively unhinged and yelling when I said it all he had to do was look me up and down and say, “Yeah, same.”   I feel so unheard. Like I’m screaming into a void and all that comes back are demeaning rejoinders invalidating my experience. I don’t want this to be the end but I’m turning into someone I don’t want to be. I’m so frustrated I don’t know how to even hold it in. I am so angry, and I feel like I’ll never get acknowledged — I just have to keep swallowing it while he tells me it isn’t real. I don’t think I can handle this.   TL;DR: Freetext rant because I can’t fucking handle this any more and I need to say it to someone who won’t interrupt or put me down
2593ab47307ea6c4b22914d90a66e6151964ca3fafcbb17698b71a455dee6c99;;;Wife of ADD Husband;;;I have been married for 13 years. My husband is in therapy for a few years to teach him  skills after learning he has ADD. Anybody married to a spouse with add/adhd can relate how stressful being married to someone with add/adhd can be and the toll it takes on their relationship. I went from being a happy go lucky to the nagging, stressed, moody, anxious, withdrawn  person. I had to pick up all the pieces when he just couldn’t. He recently told me that he thinks that I should go speak to a therapist because he thinks that I have problems. He said that I have these weird mood swings etc...suggesting that maybe I have some type of personality disorder? I seriously couldn’t believe my ears. After years of waiting and hoping that he will get better..putting up with all his add behaviors he thinks that I have the problems? Does anybody else’s spouse with add/adhd also not recognize or realize the effect that their add/adhd can have on their spouse? Does anybody else that has a spouse with add/adhd think that they are the problem?
09f0fbfc2ba6eeda0f7d292032466e69566d4bed17b58ed42e32b11d4c34d821;;;I’m doing it... I’m finally ending the marriage.;;;I have finally decided to end my almost 3 years of marriage with my DX husband. He (25) and I (24) have had an incredibly rocky marriage from the very first day we were married. There was a lot of pressure for us to get married quick. I was not ready. But he insisted and one day said it was now or never. we went to a court house and got hitched. No family... no loved ones. I knew I didn’t want to do it, but I did it anyways. Cause I thought he would leave me if I didn’t marry him (young and dumb). The ADHD has played a significant roll in this ending. And that makes me feel like the devil. I couldn’t stick around because I couldn’t handle his disability? How horrible is that ? We were at our breaking point in the beginning of this year. That’s when he decided to get medication and to treat his ADHD. It helped him a little bit. He has a pretty high dosage. I tried to force him to eat through the whole process, he just wouldn’t eat. He lost 40 pounds in 3 months. He would have episodes of anger and being pissed off for no reason. Even though he was medicated he was barley able to do the bare minimum (if that) I love him. I really do. That’s why I’ve been with him the years that I have. I just know he’s giving his 100% right now. And it sounds messed up... but it’s not good enough for me. It still leaves me feeling like I am picking up most of the slack. I still need to drag him to do things. I still have to beg for his help. It sucks it really does. I just want an equal partner... and this whole marriage has drained me. I feel like I am the mother to a teenage boy. I just can’t anymore... how do I rid myself of all of this guilt ? Makes me sick of myself... I hate it. I just can’t do it.
0349c53b7d1f1e0cb3b67beafbeb6b038f71696d8017f63a113b78a82faecb54;;;I cannot keep reminding you;;;One of the things I’ve been working on with myself about working with my dx husband is that I am not responsible for his actions. I’ve even met with his therapist and was directed that I need to be more hands off with him. So for instance I don’t wake him up for work anymore. It’s his responsibility. I remind him of things a couple of times but then I am hands off. It’s hard for me to do that but it’s also important because I can’t keep being his caretaker. Well for Christmas I shopped and bought all our niece and nephews and his family presents, I wrapped all of them, figured out what time we needed to be at his families socially distanced Christmas. I just did a lot. I’ve been doing a lot. Well because I did all this stuff for Christmas, and I am currently having cramps and it’s my time of the month right now so I am in general just really not able to be in the ring on some things. So he offered to take our dog to her grooming appointment today. And I told him what time and I reminded him before bed that she needed to be there at 11 yadda yadda. And I told myself and him that this is his responsibility. Well I woke up and started watching a movie so I too lost track of the time and when I looked at the clock it was 11:15 and he had still not woken up and I’m just so mad. I’m mad you guys. I know I’ve posted here before but I am mad. I feel like I live with a fucking child sometimes. Our house is just a fucking wreck. I’m responsible for it too but goddamn. I feel like I carry this family and this happens so often and I hate it. Our marriage is and has been on the rocks. I’m not even sexually attracted to him that much anymore because of not only my own self esteem issues but I feel like a mom to him and that doesn’t make me feel good. I hate this so fucking much. I hate it. I really wonder what the state of our relationship is gonna look like after quarantine.

I really thought that if I put in enough work and love, eventually we would learn to live together. We didn't, although we became good at communicating, it only emphasised how different and awful we were together. The night we broke up I could finally breathe. Every day I come home to my own apartment and I thank God he isn't there hammering me about what I do and say. I'm not saying that adhd relationships are impossible, but this one were. The feeling of leaving him behind is relief and new found joy in living - I'm no longer crying everyday or arguing, I simply exist with myself and I feel so at ease at last.

That’s not me bragging, that’s just things I need to know for work. Problems that I experience literally all the time. From my username you can guess that I’m very familiar with how things work at the airport, especially with how my company operates at my home airport. My partner needed to second guess every choice I made with getting her on the airplane today. It blew my mind that she would doubt that I knew what I was talking about.   This just made me wonder, many of you must be experts in your fields or work. Does your partner do that too?

Last night, I went to bed early so they could hang out together. This morning as Roy made us breakfast before Bob came down, Roy started to tell me what he witnessed Bob do the night before. But first, as Bob came downstairs, Roy asked Bob to hand him something from the fridge. I was on the couch watching TV and Bob grabbed the item then stood there watching the TV with the item in his hand for a long time (I didn't say anything, I just waited). Eventually, Bob says, "DUDE!" and Bob turns around to hand him the thing he fetched. They laughed.  When Bob went to the bathroom, Roy turned to me and said:  "I watched him open a beer, walk over there and set it down, then stop to watch the TV for a long while, then walk back to the fridge to grab another beer. I pointed out that he already opened one, he looked at it and laughed. Then he picked up a bag of snacks and stood there eating them at the counter, created a mess of garbage, and walked away from it without a thought. Then he said down on the couch and held the remote to change the channel, but just watched the TV for about five minutes before asking where the remote was. I pointed to it and he laughed again... is that what it's like?"  I just walked over to Roy, hugged him, and welcomed him to my world. He was astounded, he'd never seen it in real life before, and now he knows. Let the healing begin!

Sometimes he won’t touch them for months, other times it’s all he does for extended periods of time. I’m currently a stay at home wife while I get through college, and I have no friends at the place we live at. So when this happens, he goes to work, comes home, hops on his game and talks to his friends all day, and then comes to bed long after me and I get no human interaction at all that day.   I’m currently going through a bad period with my mental health and the social isolation I feel makes it so much worse. I’ve tried to tell myself I should be happy he has such an innocent hobby. At least he’s not spending money, or out doing something he’s not supposed to do. But it still hurts. I feel like I’m not important at all and that he doesn’t value the time we spend together.   When I bring up how I feel, he makes more of an effort to be near me. Unfortunately he thinks sitting next to me watching videos on his phone is the same as spending time with me, or he’ll ask if I want to watch a movie so we sit together in silence for 2 hours and then he hops right back onto his game.   I’m just so lonely right now. I want to throw the damn computer away while he’s gone at work. I never would,  but that’s just how I feel.

I broke up with my ADHD bf. I couldn't take anymore. The drinking got to me in the end, he told me he'd be home in an hour, I don't care when he is home, he is free to enjoy himself, what I had a problem with is these weird promises or expectations to gives me and when he isn't home in an hour, I'm the one with the problem. I rang him, and he said to his friends "I'm gonna go, I'm in enough trouble as it is!" - I also expressed him being rude to me when drunk which I don't like. I don't like the bath full of vomit so it's clogged, I hate not being able to shower or the stench that it left, it blocked the drain. This is most nights when he drinks, he spends hours being sick.   I am intolerant to alcohol, he knew this. Once I said I'm not comfortable, he asked his friends to back him up and say "Yeah, drinking is unpredictable, can't help it if we vomit for hours when we get in". This has been the case for 3 years. This along with any other requests just makes him go into defensive mode cus he wants to be "normal". I always say ADHD is not some horrible thing, it's something we can work with and improve on the stresses of life together. But alas it was not to be. Thanks everyone on here who has helped me and support me.

We have a 6 month old and he barely does anything to help. He also has no patience. I'm back at work and he is unemployed right now so he is technically watching the baby but I come out every chance I get to play/ feed/ put down for naps etc. Whenever our little one is fussy, cries, is clingy etc (which is basically everyday bc he's a baby) he gets in a MOOD. I can hear his frustration and stomping around. I can hear him raise his voice at our 6 MONTH OLD. Ugh.   Parenting is hard enough and I have no idea what it's like for him. I try to have empathy but at the same time I'm struggling. I literally do everything around the house already, i do most of the baby care, while working full time. He sleeps in till noon, and all he really needs to do is play/ engage with our child but it's like "too much" for him.   So back to this baby #2 deal... I really want another one. We had always talked about 2. But I honestly don't think he's a good parent, he's a mediocre husband, and I don't have it in me to take care of both kids and him and work.   But I can't exactly tell him "I don't want another baby because I don't think you're capable of being a good father" ... bc well that would crush him.   Sigh. This wasn't meant to be a vent but it turned out to be one.
c76a43389be1d003f0de934ba0ab4fad79402b48eb417e938b23ab35c42b7556;;;Have hope, it can get better;;;I recently started [Melissa Orlov](https://www.adhdmarriage.com/)'s non-ADHD partner class that will go for eight weeks. Almost all of the attendees (all women) in the class are in the early stages of anger, frustration, sadness, and contemplating divorce. That was me in a lot of ways only nine months ago but my ADHD partner has embraced what it means and how it works, and we've turned around the ship.  Every Sunday night we sit down and go through our dry erase [weekly/monthly calendar](https://www.amazon.com/Calendar-Whiteboard-Magnetic-Calendars-Refrigerator/dp/B07K2DBNDP/ref=sr_1_11?crid=2IO85X8PQLOFX&dchild=1&keywords=magnetic+whiteboard+for+fridge&qid=1600104516&sprefix=magnetic+white%2Caps%2C161&sr=8-11) to make sure all the tasks are accounted for, we organize our medications for each day thanks to pill sorters, and he set timers in his phone to make sure meds were taken and tasks completed. I'm so proud of how far he's come in these nine months, in spite of the frustration finding a good and consistent doctor and three medication switches.  There is hope, if you can partner up and tackle the problems together, you can work as a team to create the home and life you want to have. It takes responsibility to handle it and it definitely still gets frustrating sometimes even when things even out, but once you get on the same page as a team it can get so much better than it seems today.  I really recommend Melissa Orlov's classes if you can afford it. The couples class completely turned it all around for us.

I love how in-depth our conversations can be about it, even when its things like how he's learning how to skip rope properly and the progress he's made etc.
539d5af16286227f9f8b5b522f674e43abfce1fd4711efccb2c9620dc14ed7c4;;;I just figured out why ADHD partner gets MORE done than me.;;;So, this evening I had a revelation of sorts. I was feeling frustrated / resentful that my ADHD husband has been tackling so many projects during quarantine (WHERE ARE THEY COMING FROM!? He's taken up woodworking, y'all. I don't even know.) and yet, things that have been on my own personal To-Do list for ages are still there, taunting me, even with all the "extra" time. It occurred to me that, *of course* he's getting more done than me. His ADHD brain only sees the things it wants to see. Whereas I can be working in the yard and think, "I really need to mulch the garden too. But, it's getting late. Not a good time to start that. Need to clean up these tools, shower, get kids to pick up their toys, prepare supper, eat supper, bathe children, put them to bed, and then hopefully have some time & energy to spend with my partner before we fall asleep..." He doesn't see any of that stuff. His full attention is on one thing, the latest addition to his home office. His sole focus and concern is, has been all day: build, sand, glue, paint. I always figured the struggle was for ADHDers to get anything accomplished, but in this case, he is able to hyperfocus on his hobbies and projects, at the exclusion of all those little demands & things that get in the way for neurotypical me.

For the last month it's been like living with him before he was medicated and I've fallen back into the pattern of walking behind him to shut doors, turn off lights, put food back into the fridge, remind him of appointments, and try not to throttle him in his sleep. He apologizes, I tell him it's not on purpose and I get that, but it's difficult being back in the place of having to make sure doors are locked and the garage door is closed at night, etc.  Today he was supposed to go see his doc in order to have the meds re-adjusted and Adderall refilled. But he forgot. Because he didn't put it on the calendar. Because the Adderall isn't working anymore. They moved his appointment to five days from now, and I will welcome that day with open arms.   I marveled at how easy it was to change the appointment without penalty because, of course, they must have patients miss them all the time. Ahhh, you have to laugh.
0b782c1ab16dc7f3dc719522e5ba2c34a07da1efb36529cc27d7527402bbf7fd;;;I feel so alone sometimes;;;Hey. I'm a long time reddit lurker but have never posted before... But I feel so lost and hurt right now as I sit in a grocery store parking lot, that I figured I would try give writing a post a shot and see if anyone could give me any good advice or even make me feel less lonely.   I'm a 25 f dating a 25 m with diagnosed ADHD. We have been in a relationship for just over 2 years. We have a lot of issues and fight so much. He lives with me and my parents because he's been handed a shit hand in terms of life and we wanted to give him a fair shot at picking up his life.  I don't want to get into many details but atm I'm just feeling overwhelmed. I try and ask him to please keep track of his cups and dishes better, since he has a habit of constantly leaving them wherever he uses them and I'm left to pick them up. I know it is due to his ADHD and I try to be patient. Just like I try to be patient at the fact that he rarely ever comes to check up on me to see how I'm doing or to give me affection; meanwhile I'm constantly making sure he's okay as he plays video games or cards in his room.  But today--and subsequently the reason I'm posting this-- is that we got into a fight. Except from my POV I wasn't trying to fight... At all. I had just been trying to explain my feelings. See, I have a 1 year old German Shepherd who loves going out on walks, and me and my Bf have been trying to go on walks more to be healthy and to improve our relationship... But I was told to wait since he was in the middle of a video game and had to finish "one thing." I'm an avid video game player myself so I get it-- take 10 mins to get to a good and safe stopping/saving point and then good to go!  ... Except the dog and I ended up waiting about half an hour. Now, normally this wouldn't be a big deal... Until it dawned on me that I'm constantly expected to wait for him to do whatever he finds that he needs to do, before getting what I want. If I cook dinner and ask him to come eat, I have to wait until his game is over. If I ask him to help me take in the groceries and he spots a stack of magic: the gathering trading cards, I'm told to wait until he sorts through the whole stack... To the point where I'm usually done by the time he puts it down. If I need help with something, I have to wait for him to finish what he's doing or else he gets angry with me.  Well today I was feeling kind of sad about it. I have my own issues-- chronic anxiety, depression, ocd... So I told him I was sad and he asked me why, and I didn't really have an answer. So he left me in my room for a solid 15 minutes to go back into his room to finish his video and came back, which had only made me sadder in his absence. Eventually I admitted that it made me sad that I was left constantly waiting and felt put second in a lot of aspects. I made sure to say it in a calm way that didn't sound accusatory or like I was BLAMING him-- I was just trying to be truthful about my emotions.   He got angry.   He told me about how he has explained this a million times and that it has to do with his ADHD and that he can't change anything about it and won't apologize for the behavior. I ended up falling into silence as I usually do, as he tells me that since I don't have ADHD, that I "won't get it." And he's right-- I've never claimed to be an ADHD expert. But this response made me feel so unheard and made me feel like my emotions or feelings weren't important at all. I've been holding in tears for over an hour because I had to drive him to work, and he recovered from the fight rather quickly, but I didn't want him to know I was still upset about it as I didn't want to stress him out before work.  I'm just feeling so sad. I feel like I'm not allowed to say anything if it pertains to a behavior caused by his ADHD. I feel like I'm always told I have to deal with it and the emotions it causes by myself, or else I'm being unfair. I'm so sick of feeling so alone and unheard and unimportant because of this. I love him and do my best to care for him but this sort of thing always just tears me into pieces that I have to pick up by myself, lest I make him angry and self-defensive again by trying to talk about it. I don't know what to do.
a6064742d3a1ead19d253d3ecc1f5b43537c65b83faa3305b84227dbeb20ef5e;;;I understand both DX and non-DX perspective (Emotions);;;So my situation is a bit unique in that I am DX and medicated, but my meds, along with effort, are working incredibly well, to the point that I can almost function at the NT level (with some exceptions).  I want to start out by saying that I understand why everyone here is so frustrated. *It’s incredibly difficult to empathize with your ADHD partner when you’re directly affected by their actions over and over and over again.*  In fact, when I’m medicated, I also see myself judging others and getting angry when they can’t live up to NT standards. For example, a coworker in my team told me that he also has ADHD. Constantly submits his work late, which directly affects me because my work is dependent on his. When I learned of his ADHD, I thought, I should really give him some slack since I know exactly how he feels. But after a year of dealing with it, I grew to resent him, to the point that I just wanted to scream in his face, “WHY CAN’T YOU JUST DELIVER ON TIME? THE WORK IS NOT HARD AND I’VE REMINDED YOU 5 TIMES ALREADY. STOP PROCRASTINATING YOU PIECE OF SHIT”. I would ask for his progress multiple times before the deadline and every time he would say that he is able to deliver. Then, on the due date, he would tell me that he hasn’t finished and needs more time. I am ashamed to admit that I fantasized about choking him (and not in a good way) more than a handful of times.  And these emotions were coming from *me*. A *diagnosed ADHD patient* who is an absolute disaster without meds. In fact, when I’m not taking my meds, I would do the exact same thing. And by "the exact same thing", I really mean exactly the same. When a coworker would ping me asking about the progress on my project, I would confidently tell them I can finish on time (while procrastinating). That is the REALLY terrible thing about the ADHD brain. I wasn’t lying at the time. I really wasn’t. *At the moment, I actually believed I can finish on time*, even though I hadn’t even started the work, because my brain is just so shitty at gauging my own abilities. And then, on the due date, I couldn’t submit it. Why? Because I hadn’t started until the day before it’s due.  You know what’s worse? You would think, at this point, I would feel ashamed and try to learn from my mistakes and stop procrastinating, right? But no. My thought process is somehow entirely different when I’m off my meds. I of course feel shame (on the inside), but I would feel more resentment towards the person scolding me. I would think, what’s the big deal? It’s only going to take a couple more days. Give me a break - I have a mental condition that hinders my executive abilities. Also, you were late last month, too.  As you can see, I was defending my ego by:  * Downplaying the seriousness of my actions * Showing victim mentality and helplessness * Bringing up things that the other person did in the past (“you did it too”)  I honestly don’t know why I do this. In my experience, it’s a natural thing that the ADHD brain tries to do, due to RSD. I don’t even realize I am doing this in the moment because I’m so emotionally heated and I actually believe I’m in the right. It’s not even that “it’s difficult to admit I am in the wrong”. *In that moment, I actually believe I’m justified in my anger and resentment and everything seems so logical*. Laughable, I know. But it's true.  I’ve actually gotten, much, much, better about this, once I begin to realize what I was doing. The key is that the person with ADHD has to actually realize that they do this, and how immature and embarrassing and *dumb* it is. It stings to admit it, but it's a step towards improvement. Then the person has to actually want to change, and make serious efforts. These days I still can’t help but feel the above emotions. But the difference now is that I bite my tongue, tell myself to shut up, and own up to my mistakes. Then, at a later time, I think about what I did and pat myself on the back for it.  In my experience, the emotional components (lashing out, blaming others, not taking responsibility, etc.) of ADHD can be managed largely even when unmedicated, but only when the person realizes what they are doing and puts in serious effort to fix them. It’s easier to work on it when you’re medicated. BUT, even if you’re medicated, these emotional issues won’t automatically resolve itself.  I know I have written quite a lot, so I will stop here. I can also write about my findings on the behavioral components of ADHD as well, if anyone is interested.
700dba06b66c6bbeee7007c3af323388d8fd6b7564f6a6339197b0884ad81e0e;;;ADHD wife preaches self-care from the couch while I keep the house running;;;We ended up fighting again tonight after she sent me another video about prioritizing self-care over household work.  This is all fine and good if you have someone else pulling their weight. What do you do if you don’t have that option, and outside help isn’t an option because of the pandemic and immunocompromised children?  Our division of responsibilities:  Me - earn the money (able to work remotely, thankfully) - manage finances - manage medical care and insurance - grocery shopping, cooking all meals and dishes/cleanup - housekeeping (except the bathrooms, which we have our older kids starting to manage—such a relief) - clothes shopping and laundry with the kids  Her - Supervise kids while they do online school - Supervise kids during the time between when they finish school and I finish work - our laundry, which sometimes gets finished by the end of day 2 without my help - manage her ADHD, anxiety and depression with medication and regular therapy   I’ve laid this out for her before and talked about how it’s killing me. She offers to take on more, then doesn’t actually take care of it, and then I get to play catch-up on the stuff she’s neglected. If I push her on why she didn’t take care of it, she spirals and blames my unrealistic expectations. I don’t know how many more times I can take this “you should take care of yourself first” conversation without absolutely losing my shit. I know her brain is unkind to her, but a little recognition of her own part in my overwhelming workload would go a long way.
9d6ab50131cad7b46bcde45cb2864ffb65a27e3e5dd0d5450bdef5b1ee4bc9c4;;;Today I F'd Up By Moving The Papers Pile (I know you know it);;;Our cat has been on a vengeful pee rampage, so this week while my partner (DX in childhood, no treatment ever) was at work I moved all of our soft things and papers out of the areas the cat can get to as a precaution while we wait for the vet appointment where we say a happy farewell to the cat's fuzzy little balls.   This included, unfortunately, the paper pile. I know you all have one or something similar in your space if you share it with an ADD/ADHD partner. It's where mail, paystubs, magazines, business cards, random receipts and everything else goes to die. It is forever about to be organized. It creeps to encompass any surface nearby. If you ever break and organize it yourself, it reforms almost immediately. It is my enemy now and forever.   I briefly flipped through the pile, recycled the old grocery store ads and empty envelopes, and put everything else in a big basket in Partner's office. I did not attempt to organize it for him or make judgements about what was important or needed.   He got PISSED. He was going to do it on his own time. He's mad that I moved his stuff. He can never find anything because I do this.   Ya'll I am TIRED. I know it's frustrating to have your things moved and I can respect personal space and personal things as much as anyone, but we cannot have a mountain of papers smelling like cat pee in the kitchen. We are adults.

Barkley: The Importance of Emotion in Understanding and Managing ADHD;;;I've come across some in depth lectures from Russell A. Barkley, explaining the process of how emotions work within ADHD. Keep in mind: it's written for professionals, so the content is pretty "dry", but I personally found the *willpower fueltank* diagram pretty interesting. It explains how selfregulatory strength, the ability to control strong emotions, is a limited resource pool. There are things that deplete that pool, and there are things that replenish it (you can skip to 1:29:43 for this part).  For those that don't mind the theory, he also talks about how emotional disregulation has been a part of the core diagnosis of ADHD in the past (DSM), and how it shifted to comorbidities such as ODD (oppositional defiant disorder). He's an advocate for keeping emotions within the ADHD criteria, as it would better explain the struggles it brings.  [The lecture (free)](http://adhdlectures.com/lecture-view.php?LectureID=16)

I've viewed some pretty toxic comments toward people with ADHD, and it's both unhelpful and not very thoughtful.  Everyone deserves some compassion, there is always something left out of a story, it is not our place to judge people we do not know, rather, if we are able we should be encouraging education to further the understanding of anyone going through a particularly tough time.

The first year was great, he was very attentive and I felt attracted to him. But my attraction went down when I noticed him becoming dependent on me for things like meals and cleanup. I didn’t have good boundaries but after working on it in counseling, I have been able to communicate when it’s becoming a parent-child dynamic.  But since that time I’ve struggled to want to have sex, and sometimes when I do he’ll end up doing something a bit childish that turns me off. He seems to get really excited and then just kind of... grab at things? I know he’s trying but it doesn’t feel good to me. Or he’ll be careless and accidentally pull my hair or something.. lol. It’s like he’s just hyper focused on his own enjoyment and thinks I’m enjoying it too. Ive asked him to be gentler or just more mindful of time (if we are kissing he will want to continue indefinitely, every time, so it makes me not want to start). Or if we are hugging during the day he will grab my behind for as long as possible, until I pull away. It leaves me feeling like I have to always say no at some point, and it’s easier to just not get close sometimes. Does anyone else have this? I’ve never experienced it in other relationships. Ive talked to him  about it but it’s like he doesn’t notice in the moment to apply what we’ve talked about.    We moved in together just after the pandemic started, and though we are good at living together, I feel like I can’t rely on him to do what he says or if he will suddenly get too busy with work to cook or cleanwhat he said. So it creates a very unsexy dynamic where I will feel attracted to him when he is being attentive to contributing, but it doesn’t last long enough for me to actually want sex.    I want to acknowledge and reward his progress, he really does try, and things are a lot better than before. And he is such a sweet and caring guy, and I love how he makes life fun and cares about creating the best life for us. But it leaves me feeling drained because I’m the one to have to take care of most of the un-fun every day stuff. I’ve asked him to get diagnosed but he says he’s too busy to go to a doctor and go to counselling,  but says he will one day. I just don’t think I can wait that long. I just keep hoping that we will be able to work through these things and I will find my sex drive again. But I’m the only one pulling the cart most of the time.   I feel so conflicted, like it’s my fault for not wanting to be intimate, but when I write it all out I can see why it’s the case. But I know he loves me and is trying. I want that to be enough but it’s not.   If anyone can relate to this experience or give insight on how they got out of this dynamic, whether within the relationship or apart, I’d love to hear it. Maybe some shared experiences will help me feel less alone in this experience. Thank you.

I am ADHD and medicated living with a non ADHD partner and while I know they love and care about me; I also know they are getting to a tipping point.   I do my best to listen to what they tell me they need and internalize those things. It is however really difficult.  They do so much work trying to understand what ADHD is like, and why I do things like hyper focus or forget I am in the middle of something and leave it mid task. They are starting to understand but I need to do my part.   I want so badly to do my part and I am seeing a therapist, but ADHD is a curse that way. It's very difficult to work on your ADHD because you have ADHD. It's all the standard issues.  * I can't stay on task doing research, and working on me * The extreme guilt associated with the above * Exhaustion from the emotional energy it takes me to stay mindful for half of the time at best  * Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria  I know they are frustrated and I completely understand why how frustrating living with me can be.   There absolutely are other compounding factors, and I know its not simple at all... but what are some things you need to see from your partners?   What things could we do that would show that we are really trying, that we care, that we are as frustrated with ourselves as you are with us?  I feel lost and scared that I can't be what my partner needs, and wanted to get some partner perspectives.  Edit:  I wanted to thank you all for your advice and encouragement. I know I am from "the other side" so thank you for being so welcoming. I don't want to speak for all ADHD partners, but you all are inspiring and frankly put up with a lot from me/us... Just know that I/we see it... I/we just struggle with showing that on the outside even though its screaming on the inside. I might be on an emotional swing right now... but I think this one might be warranted.

WTH.;;;I feel like I have been gaslighted heavily and manipulated a lot in my marriage. I found something crazy recently so I was already planning on calling things off. So much avoidance, defensiveness, minimizing/blame shifting/denial/justification. No accountability. No willingness to problem solve. Unable to acknowledge the context of my reactions (i.e. I am frustrated because I want to discuss underemployment and how you plan to work on fixing this issue and you are refusing to have the conversation).   My relationship has been such a mindfuck. Anyone else here been accused of gaslighting as the NT partner? I feel like I'm with a narcissist. So much confusion, frustration, hypersensitivity, lack of empathy as well as lashing out if I ever reflect back to him any results of his behavior that are less than heroic. Am I alone in this?

I'm currently reading the book "Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents" by Lindsay C. Gibson, and while it focuses on parent/child dynamics, the basic description of emotionally immature people seems to fit a lot of the ADHD partners posted about here. I'm wondering, does emotional immaturity masquerade as ADHD, or is it more common for those with ADHD to have a harder time developing emotionally?   I don't have an answer, there would have to be a number of studies done to get any idea, but I'm curious what everyone here thinks.  This was the quote from the book that really struck me: "As a result, their natural style is to promise something, not do it, apologize perfunctorily, and then resent people if they keep bringing it up."
3e9c50bae701579df14ba3e61c70776ddbac074fe94d46e24509d0be4660f4e0;;;Do you ever get the feeling you're being played?;;;Do you ever wonder if the explosive temper tantrums are more of a planned episode rather than just a knee-jerk overreaction to an issue? For example:  Your partner and his buddy mention during the week how it would be awesome to hang out Saturday, play some music, just chill. Your partner thinks, okay, now how to convince my gf/bf/husband/wife that this should happen, considering I've hung out with friends every night this week... Then  Saturday rolls around and they realize they've also not done the dishes going on 4 days since they said they would. "The house is a mess too, and surely, the bf/gf/h/w is going to want me to stick around and help clean. Hmm..." they think to themselves.  Next thing you know, something so miniscule happens and they're flying off the handle. "I can't take this, I gotta relieve some stress, I'm going for a walk"; banking that we're surely not going to say "uh, what, you have shit to do" when they're that heated. After a couple hours, a "where ya at?" call is made. "I walked over to buddies house to play some music, you know what a stress reliever that is for me!"  Couple hours later, they walk in all smiles, "yeah, man I needed that!" Cuz ya know...stress of dodging chores gets pretty overwhelming.   So yeah, I'm definitely thinking that all this "temper tantrum, flying-off-the-handle" shit is often done to get their way, with no argument on our part; that is, when the tantrum preludes their choice of hobby/entertainment. Just seems rather convenient sometimes. But maybe I'm just too suspicious of people.

I've always taken on the brunt of the housework without really thinking about it, and in the past couple of years have been gently trying to get my partner (34, DX in childhood) on board. He does his own laundry now but rarely shared laundry like towels and linens, takes out the trash and scoops the cat box when it gets bad, and will do a sink of dishes maybe once a month if I beg and remind him to the point of a fight.   I don't think he's ever wiped a counter, cleaned the bathroom, grocery shoped, cleaned the fridge, or swept and mopped in the entire time we've lived together (3 years). He also has the habit of leaving piles of mail, unfinished projects with dozens of tiny screws, and dirty dishes and empty drink cans on every surface.   Some days I come home and want to cry seeing the counter where I have to cook dinner covered in cans, dirty dishes, mail, tools, etc and knowing I have to clean all of that before making dinner and cleaning that too. If I ask for help he tells me to relax and he'll do it, but he often forgets and we move on with our day or leaves to help a friend with a project. I can't relax in a messy house, and I want to enjoy the home I'm working to pay for.   We have tried everything - lists, reminders, splitting chores up. In the morning, I write everything I'm going to get done that day on a whiteboard in the kitchen, then send him a few reminders through the day while I'm at work asking for help knocking some off. This past week, I did just that and came home from work to find nothing done, but his home office totally rearranged. I honestly didn't mind - it's a big project for him and I'm so happy he has a nice workspace to concentrate in.   So while he got a little work done before our show and dinner, I tackled the to-do list. He called out that I didn't have to do all of it, but I've heard that so many times before and I just wanted it done. It took me maybe 45 minutes. I knocked on his door to see if there were any towels he wanted me to throw in the laundry towards the end, and he blew up at me, yelling that I was making too much noise while he was trying to work, that he was going to help clean, and why couldn't I just fucking sit down and relax?   I cried. I can't help it. I cry when I get yelled at and I felt awful for disrupting him. I didn't know I was being loud. He sighed and said we should just 'go do our own things tonight' and asked me why I always have to cry. I felt completely lost. I still don't know what to do. Certain chores have to be done every day or every week, and I can't wait until he gets around to it. I don't mind doing more of the chores, but I don't want to be yelled at for doing them. Is this RSD or do I just need to get out? Is there any way to work on this?   Edited for typos and to clarify the end.

We stayed together for about 1/5 years.  Typical story where the first 6 months were amazing (the best) and after i started realizing the excessive talking and inattentive listening. Then we started with the fights. Fighting about things that didnt matter at all, just stuff that she came up with blaming me for things that i didnt do, not acknowledging all the help i was putting in place in order to maintain the relationship stable.  Felt also that i was the only pillar holding the relationship together, that I had to do everything, almost all the chores and all that.  She was taking meds but I think the doctor was giving her depression meds, and the ADHD wasnt being treated. That´s what i felt anyways.  Then recently, she had one of those impulsive hurtful comments that not even my worst enemy would say it to me and I feel like people should be responsible for the shit they say regardless of any issues. That one broke my heart in a way that i´ve never imagined.  I have never loved anyone as I love her, but I made the decision to end because i felt i lost the values of who I AM. I lived the last 2 years of my life emotionally supporting her, but I felt like I had very little support back and in my humble opinion, relationships should be equal compromise from both parts.  Now im feeling like shit, guilty and still very unhappy. Anyone has been through this to let me know how long until I start feeling better ?  Thanks,

He takes his meds but it ends there. I can’t do it anymore. I can’t do it for him anymore. When the baby comes, I can’t be on top of him. If he’s taking his meds, did he make the doc appt, how he is on refills? All while trying to maintain my sanity and keep a baby alive. I’m scared. I’m tired. I’m resentful. I’m not asking for much. I know it can be hard. And it’s also as if I enable. Because I do it. But if I don’t, it affects both of us. It affects me. I’ve given the whiteboards, the lists, the apps, therapy #’s, men’s group info. He’s an amazing guy. I love him to death but I’m going to have a mental breakdown if he doesn’t try methods that work for him. We started counseling and I really wish we did it sooner. Anyways, this was my vent. It’s my last day before maternity leave and I know he doesn’t remember and it’s all just sad.
a31ac1f34478ab73eaa19af36ba596f96e13830728cd66afe369674a1a55e755;;;I've realized that it isn't just ADD, it's also the marijuana.;;;We just started marriage counseling, and at our first session I talked about how I've told him (DX medicated) that our marriage was ending. He called me a liar, that I never said that to him.    How does someone forget their spouse saying "This is the end of our marriage" and the entire conversations surrounding that?  I'm talking about two, separate, in depth conversations full of tears and emotion.    I started to really think about our history of fights, and his disconnectedness, and it all started clicking.  Every time we fought, I would cry and beg him to step up and be a husband, and then he would make promises, and then he would smoke a bunch of weed and act like nothing ever happened. Now I realize that he really doesn't know what happened. He smoked away every fight and every uncomfortable conversation. I had been blaming our problems on the ADD, but this kind of complete amnesia goes beyond ADD.    I had a one-on-one with our councilor and she brought up his weed use before I even mentioned it. She recognized it's affects on our marriage...probably because he thought we were there for a casual chat on communicating while I was bawling that I was exhausted and couldn't take being in our marriage anymore. (He already forgot everything about our counselling session.)  The councilor wants to ask him to stop smoking. I don't think he will.  I'm having a really hard time reframing everything in terms of ADD and, well, being stoned all the time. So, I'm asking if you can share your story. Do you have experience with your partner mixing ADD/ADHD with weed? I'm open to any discussion on the topic while I try to wrap my head around this. It would be great if someone could tell me that their spouse quit/ cut back on their weed usage and how that turned out. Or if you observed how marijuana has an effect on your partner's ADHD/ADD symptoms.   And honestly, I'd be happy to hear from anyone about now.
521f64baa652b2433a6629a68afbadca53df82a999cef92b4ba56dbba0d5f89f;;;Is it finally time?;;;Hey guys, I (25f) have been with my partner (25m, Dx) for almost 5 years and live together for just under 4 years. He has never really talked much about his struggles with ADHD and until recently I didn’t realize how much ADHD was affecting our relationship. I started researching the affects it has and different ways it can present, especially the issues that can arise in relationships. I stumbled upon this subreddit and it has given me a lot of comfort in realizing it’s not just me. He hyper focuses a lot and that often doesn’t leave a lot of room for me and he doesn’t express his emotions effectively so it can leave me feeling unloved and questioning where we stand more often than I’d like. When I try to have healthy conversations about these things he will often shut down and not say anything. I have had anxiety and depression for a number of years and have a fair amount of trauma so I would often just minimize my feelings so as not to cause one of his shutdowns. This obviously has shutdown a lot of our communication and when I approached him about whether or not he would be willing to go to therapy, he said “Nah, I understand that the way I deal with things is different than other people but it works fine for me.” As someone who is currently in therapy trying to improve myself, I see it as a really great thing for all people who struggle with mental disorders. Even times where I can talk about it and I tell him I need more affirmation and quality time, things get better for a few weeks and then go right back to where they were. I’m at a point now where I am growing very tired and all the effort I put in feels unmatched. I understand how hard this can be from his perspective but at some point I think he started wearing it as his personality and has made it inseparable from himself.   So where I’m at right now, I’m going to have one last conversation about whether or not he is willing to seek treatment in the form of medication or therapy, preferably both, and if he isn’t willing then I need to accept that and move on. My main issue is that we haven’t really talked much specifically about his ADHD and while he was diagnosed as a child, I don’t think interventions were taken. I’m going to try in this conversation to approach it from a standpoint of how the symptoms are affecting our relationship. We either grow together or grow apart. Any insight, advice, consolation, etc. you can offer would be appreciated.

All of my past relationships were really intense sexually & I always felt desired. Now we don’t even kiss except to say goodbye sometimes, we barely touch at all. After 4 years of marriage our sex life doesn’t even exist anymore. At this point I feel like the sex/intimacy part of our relationship is dead & I have a messy roommate or kid. There was some trauma in their past that caused issues around sex but it wasn’t like this in the beginning. Now I’m wondering if the ADHD is the really issue more than the past trauma. While it doesn’t seem to bother my spouse I feel like it makes me less close & more agitated by the bad habits.

And it's just been over a year of  being together (we're both 25, he's diagnosed and medicated).

I'm so exhausted with being understanding and filling in the blanks all the time with no help. And I'm tired of constantly having to have talks with him because it's starting to sound like nagging to me. Those who have been doing this for years, please tell me how you do it.

I know partly this is due to depression and I know I didn’t used to feel this helpless years ago. I’ve always been one to handle life and just work on things I can and accept what I can’t yet or at all. I believe I’ve been depressed over the past 3/4 years due to my partner and also other things in life like jobs that didn’t work out or family problems. My partner wasn’t really that supportive through my family problems over the years and that hurt. I mean I’m not ever wanting to be up their ass and around the corner but I think if you can and it makes sense for all parties involved, having a good familial bond is a good thing, they’re your support system and that shouldn’t be pushed away unless they are toxic. My partner is like the opposite of that with his family and they’re not all toxic. They just keep to themselves and there’s not much communication going on or it seemed as though they just all kept to themselves and I thought that was better than my family for awhile. Now I realize that that style of communication isn’t healthy either, it just seeks to disconnect and also push things under the rug that should be discussed or hashed out. So I feel like the way I grew up and dealing with problems head on wasn’t the greatest either all the time cause sometimes it caused problems too.   Anyways I’m getting to the point of like we used to be so different and I still am, but I feel like I’ve become more avoidant to people because of the dysfunction of our relationship and people just not getting being a partner to someone who has ADHD/ASD and their lack of empathy towards the situation and either partners. I get anxious and don’t want to talk to anyone about my issues anymore because people just tell me to leave the relationship. I get anxious not being able to talk about things with people and that adds to more anxiety and me not taking care of myself and procrastinating on life goals. It’s bad. Like I do the bare minimum to sustain my life and my pets life and then want to just lay in bed for hours on end not wanting to live my life. Therapy adds up over the week and I only have so much money to pay someone to listen to me and give me more sound advice, rather than listen to the people I know who have not been in an NT/ADHD/ASD relationship before. I feel like I’m experiencing symptoms and I know I don’t have an executive dysfunction.   Anyone else feel so stressed out by your relationship that you feel like you somewhat absorbed your partners ADHD/ASD? Like ADHD by proxy? Maybe it’s a codependency thing too. Idk I just feel like I should be taking better care of myself but I’m lacking the motivation to do it.

He has all the classic symptoms and struggles because of them. He hates the doctors becausehe fears he'll be rejected, he'll never go even if he's really sick or injured, so I was very proud he went.   He got the referral but the GP had to go and say "I don't think you have it because you hold down a job"   I'm gob smacked. He works in programming and his jobs always changing and solving puzzles, so it suits his characteristics well.   So he's come back feeling defeated and like he doesn't want to try (rejection sensitivity is something he really struggles with)

Like my husband will randomly just be super helpful around the house or spend the day making ‘his’ room (it’s the guest room but he’s taken it over with his firefighter stuff and his computer set up) look nice, or the other day he went to the store, got all the makings for dinner, sent me into a room to relax after work, while he made dinner and poured me a glass of wine. He’s unmediated so these sort of things only happen like once every 2 weeks unless he’s really stressed out. But it’s nice to forget he has ADHD for a bit and have him contributing to the household

He may see this post (hey boo) and I wanted him to know how much that meant to me. His effort to understand me above and beyond makes me tear up, all the people who never bothered to understand me, they just dismissed and punished me when they were supposed to love me. I feel so loved. It feels amazing when someone is willing to do the work to understand you.   We are both diagnosed so this is an even bigger deal as I know how hard reading can be for him. I decided to post because there are plenty of partners, on both sides of the adhd fence, who might benefit from understanding that making the effort to learn, to not take things personally, to try to truly empathize might be the best thing you could do for your relationship.

If there is an issue, I'm usually the one raising it because he is very avoidant. But he universally takes the position that I'm just picking a fight. I'm usually reacting to poorly managed ADHD. Today's issue was around procrastination and lack of follow through on tasks. How can I get him to problem solve productively when his position is "she's just picking fights, this is all her fault and she's wrong/crazy"? I was doing some reading about blaming others and how it relates to self esteem issues and I can totally see that applying here but after six years I am really out of energy to fight for the right for my own side of the story to exist. There's never emotional space for my concerns in the moment. Occasionally he will circle back to them way later but more often than not, I'm the problem. And sure I play a role in things but his reflex blame shifting is driving me nuts. How the heck do you actually get your partner to understand what you're upset about so you can find solutions if they never try to see where you're coming from?

His ADHD has broken me literally and I couldn't leave if I wanted to.;;;Married 6 years and I will spare you the background. Usual stuff. Feeling lonely and neglected. Nothing proactive except personal interests. Head in the phone. Super ufking defensive even when I phrase things just so, or skip the complaint and go right to the request. Death by a thousand papercuts. Roller coaster relationship and a walk through a funhouse mirror when I try to work through an issue with him because he turns it around, or adds his own complaint or denies or tries to discount the validity based on unimportant details.   I am so ufking exhausted. I am broken. Literally. I have a chronic autoimmune illness that I believe came about partly from the stress of this relationship.   He takes meds, no consistent therapy. Lots of shame and self esteem issues. Underemployed so I'm the breadwinner on top of all the administrative stuff the partner has to usually manage on some level.   So lonely. I resent that he is so passive about behavioral self support. He just let's it all hang out, path of least resistance. I've had to resort to too many ultimatums over the years. He can be quite kind, thoughtful and generous but also can have a severe lack of empathy, super avoidant, thinks I just want to complain or pick fights.   Decent father, very swingy partner. Untrustworthy because of the ADHD. I have a trauma history so his untrustworthiness is SUPER difficult for me. The chaotic life, lack of routine, is also hard. The mess oh dear God the mess. The lack of effort to talk through anything fully or problem solve. He wants me to just tell him what to do. I feel like that's so lazy and again neglectful to the relationship. We have seen 2 counselors together. Currently I've said no more as a couple until he works on himself first. The self esteem issues make communication impossible and I'm over it.   We have a toddler. Because of having a toddler, and having a chronic illness, and him already saying he would move away if we divorce (too far for me to even get parenting breaks every other weekend), I'm trapped. The stress makes my illness worse. It's hard to vent to friends without feeling like my husband is right and I am BPD because the relationship is so up and down. It's hard to work on my personal issues because his crises and the pain points, resentment and hurt of the present keep taking over my energy.   His daughter volunteered to help him remember a dinner option tomorrow and I nearly lost my mind when he thanked her proactively and with warmth in his voice.   Like dude, where the ufk is the warm, proactive appreciation for what I do on a daily basis for the last 6 years?!?!? He says she volunteered without also giving him ish for it.   I suspect anyone in my shoes, having to reconcile this chaos on the daily, would eventually not be able to help without also being exasperated.   I'm so tired. I have let go of so many expectations. I'm not ready to accept that my practical needs for equitable distribution of labor are never going to be met AND I will always have to feel worthless and beg for attention. Why can't he just set reminders to schedule active effort to nurture the relationship? I feel so taken advantage of.  At the same time when I'm sick he helps without complaining and will take on all of the immediate domestic needs. Things may not be perfect but we survive. He's good when I'm incapacitated but somehow expects me to handle way too much when I'm not. Which means I'm incapacitated more and more often since I have this autoimmune disease.   I get angry and hurt and stressed then break from the stress then I'm too sick to voice my pain and he treats me better but then I recover and try to calmly express my hurt over some lapse and he gets agitated and defensive.   Sorry this is so long. I wouldn't be surprised if no one wants to even bother reading. Thanks in advance for reading if you decided to.

5b5f74f13af54aa4f0d7781215e5c55c9f74a119ed629860e3b549a5396ad1ef;;;My partner can't handle it when I'm sad or grumpy. Is this an adhd thing?;;;When he is struggling and is short or cold or snaps or just doesn't respond to what I'm saying enthusiastically, I don't say a word. I always let him be grumpy because usually it passes.   90% of the time i am grumpy and go quiet, suddenly I'm really "rude" and he goes quiet in response, and when I come out of my funk, he stays in his. He takes it personally. Instead of just standing by my side while I ride the wave he makes it into a thing.   He has had a fucked life. So much abandonment and death in his family. I'm all he has. Sometimes I wonder if maybe its that? Every other orphans I've been close too has been a rocky journey because they have such high expectations of me. Especially if I'm their only support network.  Could this be that? Is it ptsd and fear of abandonment? Or is this common with adhd?   I know he cares deep down, but its like in the moment he cant socially grasp what I need when I'm upset or grumpy.   If Im with my friends while i'm grumpy and I snap a tiny bit, they just back off and give me a second, or just hand me a cup of tea. Usually I come back and say sorry for snapping and they get it. We move on.   I wish my partner could do this for me. I feel like I have to stay strong for the both of us.  I'm always the one that initiates affection after a fight. Even if its a fight about something he has done to me. I always end up comforting him.
db7a4a7c5cb3947f0d45449ccb7ad03e66f3efda05d20979f8bb75d53f34f895;;;What are some things your partner does that shows you they’re trying, but they’re one step short?;;;I’d love to hear about the progress that your partners have made where they almost have it down but they’re just one step away from doing the thing all the way through.   My husband (dx) is messy but one thing he’s gotten really good about is taking back all dishes and garbage to the kitchen. But for whatever reason, the final destination for these things is the dining table instead of the trash or sink which are right there. I don’t mind it as much since it makes clean up easy for me but I still don’t understand the thought process.   What are some habits your partners have that make you say, “ah, you almost had it!”?
a3b2753f10652936dd6ce01ceeddd8a6ebd0a9870adef3cd74f38ec076d5cbd6;;;Persistent over-explaining issue?;;;My wife (D/med) and I have an ongoing issue with explanations and I'm wondering if anyone has insight about it.   Basically the pattern is that say, for example, she said she would do X and then the time came and X didn't get done. I say, "hey did you do X?" and the immediate response is a list of reasons why she didn't do X. The explanations come across to me like excuses, even if I try not to hear them that way. We've had good conversations in therapy where I've explained that all I really want is some acknowledgement of responsibility and a solution. Like - "oops yeah, I didn't do X, I will set a phone reminder to make sure I do it tomorrow." Easy.   BUT. She is really committed to making these explanations. She will not stop doing it. I try not to be bothered by them but I just can't sometimes. After so many years of this stuff they really come off as excuses. So I've started saying "look I really don't care why." And I've made it clear that I always assign a benign reason - it's not like I think she forgot X on purpose to hurt me (although it can start to feel like that at times). Of course there's some reason why she forgot X, and or course it was unintentional. I know.    This is where we get stuck. She loses it when I say that I don't care or don't want an explanation. When I ask "why do you feel like I need to know the reason?" I can't really get a good answer. She's so triggered at that point that we can't really have a conversation. The best I can come up with is that she feels guilt or  shame for not doing X, but if she convinces herself that she didn't mean not to, then she's not a bad person. So she has explain to me so I don't think she's a bad person. And I don't think that. I just want X to get done. But she is really angry that I don't want to hear the reasons why, and straight out says that I'm a terrible person for not caring about it. It's become an issue all on its own. I honestly, after 13 years, do not have the energy to care about it. And it has never been helpful, except in the case where she needed help doing X or something, in which case "hey I could use some help with X" is much more productive.   My question for all of you is: have you experienced this? Do you have any insight or tips?    I'd like to be able to just let her say her thing and listen, but I'm just so tired. I can't run a gauntlet of explanations every time anymore.  :(
4773e3d5162ee39ccd933719ee33f30428aaded34087a146686415360f61ac20;;;DAE ADHD partner rather insistent about things of their interest being your interest?;;;This drives me bananas.   My SO will be doing something or have an idea and then he will carry through with whatever it is (sometimes). He will then insist on a rather compulsive basis that I also be involved in whatever is he is doing/wants to do etc. Whether it is a business idea or fitness or project or trip idea or restaurant he saw driving down the road - he seems like he has an internal motor that drives him and straight at me.   I had been working all day and have a chronic health issue that is flaring up. I was also doing holiday preparation while working and mitigating my last minute to do list when I noticed I just felt icky and was swelling. I asked my partner to come check me out quick (he is a PA) and his response after glancing at me? Go for a walk. Go use the treadmill.  (Yes, I'm aware from a medical standpoint I should be exercising but Jesus Christ I could say we are out of milk and he would bring up something about the treadmill)    He has been on this kick for a few weeks now. No matter what I communicate about stress or my health or even if it is just as simple as "I have a lot to do but better go shower first", SO will bring up *something* about the treadmill or how I should work out because that's what he is currently focused on. A few weeks ago it was Minecraft. Weeks before that it was starting a business for UV light sanitation. I could keep going but he gets literally obsessed and makes sure he brings it up in almost every conversation.   God forbid I get enough after the compulsive bringing up his idea for the moment and say "No that's not happening/not doable/etc" because he immediately retreats and becomes sullen and pops off with "I'll never mention it again" and it is just so over the top dramatic. I'm not rejecting him. I'm telling him that whatever he is obsessed with at the moment isn't the answer to all of my problems.   The working out one is particularly embarrassing for me as I'm aware I've gained weight and I am rightfully sensitive about it. He is aware of this fact. It doesn't seem to deter him from making sure he mentions how I need to workout. It is just not ok. I wouldn't do that to someone. I'm wondering if he doesn't see his own behavior or thinks he is helpful or doesn't understand that while I appreciate his sharing, he gets down right obsessed with making sure whatever he is doing or wants to do, then that's what I should do too.  Edit: thanks for the down vote. We wouldn't want anyone to learn anything or just move along if they didn't like my post.
4e69cf5ee491f680c6a94744bcb4c14275349e59d8c323ec3de2c34a90d31fe0;;;The Mess.;;;I came from a clean household. Mess and clutter was not tolerated and if there was a little bit, you were called out on it fast. As a result of this, I’m a fairly clean person. My adhd dx partner seems to have a hard time with cleaning keeping things fairly tidy. I know it’s not his fault but it drives me crazy.   He will put fast food wrappers under the sink and on the kitchen top instead of in the garbage, and if the garbage is full, he will wrap it up and toss it to the side instead of where it’s supposed to go, I do all the cleaning in the kitchen because there’s only so many days I can go seeing his mess. I’m careful with my tone. I never yell or get angry about messes. I usually casually say something along the lines of “hey, when your done (with your gaming round) can you please help with picking up your clothes on the ground” and if he’s in a good mood he’ll say yes but if not, he’ll ask why I’m always bitching about messes and stuff.   What pushes me to the edge is when he uses my pc in my office (which is very clean since it’s my space alone) and leaves his papers and his stuff all around it.    It makes me feel like we’re incompatible because I can’t imagine having kids with this man and dealing with x3 of the mess with what feels like myself. I know this is a bit of a rant, but does it get better??
661087e5cc34555abfc9c392cca1a8fca175779a682d0a1ac24d3d7039672d75;;;All or nothing;;;My ADHD wife of 14 years frequently gets stuck in all or nothing mentalities.  It's gotten that way with parenting.  She is miserable and keeps talking about how she wants to be able to do art (btw, she's an artist).  I LOVE that she's an artist and wants to do art.  The problem is that she seems to not be able to do art unless she rents an expensive studio space, and is locked away in the solitude of her off site studio for 8-10 hours a day.  If she can't give her hyper focus for extended time and uninterrupted, then she just can't do it.   If she can't be creative, then she HATES her life and becomes resentful towards me and the kids as we are the reason she can't be the person she wants to be.     But she's a stay at home mom of two small children and I am the only income provider of the house.  I work from home right now, but I have to work, not do child care to afford her the time away from home to do it.  In too if that, the times in the past that she has been able to work on art, she can't do anything because she becomes paralyzed with a host of other mental and emotional blocks.  I keep asking her to help find a middle ground, but she either can't or won't.  She just stays stuck in this mental loop of everything and everyone else in her life telling her she can't.  She is constantly miserable, dealing with extreme anxiety, and on the verge of panic attacks at all time.  The fact we are living in a pandemic makes all if this q million times worse.  I'm not sure if I'm asking advice, or just getting this off my chest....  I don't know how our marriage survives this.

But id like to know if this happens to other people aswell.  Ps: please dont tell me just break up with him. I need to make sure its the right thing first and i need to think about it well.

c94bd35cde3787bcfec05bcc472307efd772a2cf47c377c6adba732b742594a0;;;How many of you have a female ADHD partner?;;;I joined this sub a long time ago and only occasionally read though it. I can sympathize with a lot of you in here and your struggles with your partner. But I’m not seeing a whole lot of people who have a female AHDH partner. I know it’s under diagnosed in women and even then it’s hard for most of them to accept. But the behaviors are so different I’m finding it hard to get much information or  resources on the topic.  We were having a lot of problems before Covid and only starting to work on looking for a new marriage counselor (we have had 3 different ones, the first two didn’t pick up on it and the third had zero idea how to handle any sort of therapy and was just charging us for what felt like essentially talking to your moms friend who took a psych course in college). Now marriage counseling is almost impossible to find and those that have any background in ADHD are solidly booked. We have been on a waiting list for 5 months now.  Idk. I’m just looking for some support and that’s probably why I’m posting here. Any advice?
c56e0a05ac726b68252053627bccc1aa9f087737e356a41f569922dd646ae172;;;Forgetfulness, ADHD, & Recurring Issues;;;How do you as the ADHD partner handle forgetfulness with your spouse? I’m not referring to quotidian things like forgetting to take out the trash but bigger communication issues.  Before my spouse was diagnosed, he could be incredibly emotionally cruel to the point where it’s deeply affected and altered not only my self worth but my goals in life since day to day success became contingent on not having a breakdown over pursuing life goals. He’s improved in some ways but basically when we have any serious discussion, he completely and totally forgets everything we’ve ever been through.  We now have more stasis in our lives but if any problem surfaces, he takes it out on me for being weak and sensitive rather than helping to fix things that he himself broke.  It’s at the point where he is delusional about what’s unfolded between us and I’m put in a position to recount the past even though I would rather not do that and then he uses it as a reason to get angry with me.  It seems like he has genuinely forgot everything that’s ever happened and then he refuses to take my word for it that these feelings are coming from a genuine place that deserve consideration. He really can only comprehend the pain he’s inflicted if my attempt at healthy communication spins way out of hand. First it’s a fight, then I’m crying & begging which annoys him and makes him meaner, until I’m eventually packing a bag. Only then does he seem convinced of the problem and our past. He gets rational and nice and understanding. But then of course this loops all over again in life ad nauseaum.  Has anyone faced this issue with a partner and come through it? Like many people on here have experienced, my partner is erratic with his treatment and were in another iteration of him swearing more therapy will help. I think it will and he finally has more money to spend on therapy, but how much can it really help?  I come here for the community. I feel alone and need help and can’t rely on my partner for it. I’m wondering if there’s anyone here that’s experienced this and come out the other side or this is just something I have to accept or walk on.  The comfort of a relationship is being with somebody that understands you. You touch a stove to learn not to touch it again. It feels like by now, we have enough of a difficult shared history that my partner should know not to touch the stove. But he still touches it and then berates me that it’s hot. I have soft spots that are a direct product of him treating me poorly and he forgets this and just treats me like a burden for having them. It doesn’t seem intentional. It’s a stupid way to live. But is there any hope it will change?
7d68709600208579c640d41e1498d4d7f9561bb0d94e3d5e045788a6fa236123;;;Recently caught a glimpse of why my ADHD spouse loses jobs;;;ADHD around the house is annoying and frustrating, as we all know and discuss frequently. But have you ever seen your ADHD spouse do something you know they've done at a job and probably resulted in discipline or firing? I just did the other day and I feel like I got a window into what happens.  I asked my spouse to run some errands for me since he's not working and I'm working at home full time. I gave him a pile of returns, some to the post office, and some to a store. When I went into the living room after working all day, I found two of the return items still sitting there even though I knew he'd come back. I asked him why those were still there. It turns out that he packed the completely wrong things and mixed up the returns.  He sort of froze instead of answering me, then hopped on his phone to retrace his steps and (I think) re-read my text to him with instructions. I heard him try to call the post office to see if the package could be stopped (no), and I got hold of the warehouse that would receive the wrong package as well as the intended recipient to tell them there had been a mistake. I had never seen him make such a huge, easily avoided mistake before that touched so many other areas and people. He was laid off months ago after making, he said, some stupid mistakes. I think this is probably what it was. Just not paying attention at all, not double checking instructions, and messing up royal.  He's made similar mistakes that were easily fixed (by me), wrote his birthday instead of today's date on documents that I caught and changed without telling him, things like that. And now I have a whole other level of anxiety when it's time for him to go back to work...
06c2766a1d625b1372b7670df8f8982fedf46977028ec80108312a4306fd4215;;;Exhausted;;;Do you every just get tired. Like really tired....... Sometimes I look at other relationships and envy how simple they are. (I feel horrible saying this :( Sometimes I just really not in the mood for my SO to have a melt down or be grumpy. Sometimes when they are having a down day it’s literally like dragging another human around all day, like a led lined jacket. It’s exhausting. All I do is worry about wether they are okay. If they took their medication. If they got enough sleep. Have they eaten. I love my SO very much but sometimes I wish we had a normal relationship and I feel horrible for saying that.
655f9b67a368c86381476d277af683c74c57c3b219618c6b82c4bab693c1eb98;;;Exhausted wife with ADHD husband - I'm New to this group;;;hi everyone, I'm glad I found this group. I'm a 33 yr old female married to 40 yr old husband (dx ADHD in childhood). we've  been together for 12 years, married for 5. While my husband has made a lot of progress in his therapy, I'm still so exhausted and I feel like I go back and forth between some days loving him more than anything,  and some days feeling like I can't stand him. it's really hard and I don't feel like I can talk to anyone that would understand.   In my opinion,  his ADHD is pretty severe and is very hyperactive. When he does manage to sit down and focus, he's always super irritable and restless afterwards.  i can literally count the number of days in 12 years that  he's stayed home an entire  day (even throughout 2020!). He always wants to get out of the house, and can't ever just relax, and will annoy the sh*t out of me until he gets his way (to go do something outside or go somewhere).  it's very contrary to my personality and drives me crazy after a long day at work.. He absolutely  refuses to take any ADHD medication,  since he had really bad experiences in childhood and was very overmedicared for ADHD and PTSD. I understand that, but I'm also feeling angry and frustrated that he won't even talk to a doctor about it or consider it.   we met in college 12 yrs ago where we both were very driven and academically successful, and  that was part of what I loved about him. Fast forward to now, and I've been in my career for 10 years and he's been in and out of jobs, not progressing with his goals or career, I've been supporting us financially for 6 years now. This year he's now in a promising job, but I had to cry, beg, plead for 2 years for him to get the motivation to get that job. i definitely have  resentment about that.   I'm just overall so tired and worn out. I'm tired of the mental and emotional energy I constantly have to expend to manage everything in our household. I'm tired of not being able to have peace and relax in my own home when he's there. I'm tired of the constant cleaning,  messes, and picking up after him. I'm angry and frustrated that he won't even consider medication that might help him immensely. Thank you for listening, I appreciate it!

Sometimes, when we get into arguments, he ignores me and goes on like everything is fine. He plays his games, he laughs at videos on his phone, he posts funny videos of himself while he’s at work. Meanwhile, I’m miserable. I’m hurt, I’m laid up in bed, I’m crying, I’m anxious.   It really confuses me because my husband is an extremely empathetic person. When I cry, he cries. When I’m hurting, he’s hurting. But then he has times like this where he just acts like he completely doesn’t care, which makes the hurt that much worse. Just wondering if anyone else experienced this too.

3e9c50bae701579df14ba3e61c70776ddbac074fe94d46e24509d0be4660f4e0;;;Here's what ADHD looks like in our house...;;;Me(38F/): Babe have you seen my jean jacket?  Him(37M/DX/NonMed): Jean jacket? You mean that ratty one in the closet?  Me: Ratty? Its a vintage Guess? jacket that doesn't look like it was ever even worn once... What does that even mean? *I look at him and see he's wearing a jean vest*   Him: What? I didn't know this was yours! I've never seen you wear a jean jacket in my life!  Me: It was Summer!!  Him: I said sorry! Here, just take it, you can have it!  Me: I don't wear jean vests!!  Moral of the story: Ask yourself, Did I buy this item? Was this item gifted to me? Was this item previously, and currently, still mine? If you answered "no" to these three questions, DO NOT mutilate, paint over, cut, bend, twist, pull apart, crack, break, stand on, write on, wash, dry, sand, wax, take apart, add to, nail, screw, heat, freeze, juggle, de-grease, set fire to, The Item you are about to "redo/fix/alter/change/make cool" without first asking if it is okay to do so. It can potentially save someone's life one day.  Edit: I buy and resell clothing, so he assumed this was something I was going to resell, which I normally don't mind if he finds something and keeps it. I'm upset because he ASSUMED incorrectly. Which is where the"ASK me first before mutilating" comes into play. He's not an asshole. Just clearing that up :)

Is this something people experience across the board?
96819be240c6caec02d516f3279b0482f0fe89c0757f2f1b55c7d4452825f500;;;How to get him to stop deflecting blame about cleanliness onto me?;;;I talk to my ADHD (unmedicated) partner respectfully and try not to use blaming/nagging tones, make it clear that I don’t care if it’s perfect. But regardless, any time I bring up an issue he will deflect by saying I do the same thing. For example leaving dishes on the counter instead of the empty dishwasher, or putting items away after using them. Instead of a simple “Sure I can try doing that”, he immediately says something like “But you do the same thing. I pick up after you the same amount and you don’t always put away your dishes right away”.  He doesn’t see that me very occasionally leaving an item out and putting it away an hour or two later is different than him leaving every single item he used out, not putting away dishes, not cleaning the counters, and leaving some items on counters for over a week or until I remind him? Why do I have to be perfect in order for him to acknowledge an issue? I feel like I can’t talk to him about anything without him playing the “well you do that too sometimes!” card. So it feels like nothing changes. I can’t be perfect and don’t want to get into “evidence collecting mode” just to justify how I feel but it feels like that’s the only way he might listen.  Has anyone else experienced this type of thing? Anyone resolved it? I feel like I’ve tried to be as healthy at communicating as I possibly can through therapy and reading and I’m tired by getting nowhere.

My husband has a telehealth appoint in a couple weeks and I am SO excited!!!!! Yesterday, was one of the worst days for me, feeling overwhelmed and I think it scared him a lot. It was a mix of a breakdown and panic attack for me, where I was crying so bad I was hyperventilating. We’re both kind of emotionally exhausted today so finding a doctor couldn’t have come at a better time.  I’m so hopeful that this will be the help that we need for our only 7 month marriage.  Also just learned his brother is now being treated for it as well and takes meds for it so at least I know I can go to his brother’s wife to help me feel as sane as possible.

I was planning on making this homemade ham and bean soup that I love to make after we’ve had a bone-in ham, since I can make my own broth and all that’s in it is ham, broth, beans, and onion. I realized I didn’t have any onion and was dreading having to run out to get one. My sweet partner offered to go to the store to get it, and I was so happy and touched that he would go out of his way. He was on his way out the door, asked me if I needed him to grab anything else. I asked him to pick up litter trays from the pet store as well, and he was like “okay! Let me know if there’s anything else!”  He left. A while later he returned, litter trays in hand, a bag with coffee creamer... and no onion. He felt so bad for forgetting but I couldn’t help but laugh. He came back without the one thing he went out for specifically. I told him it wasn’t a big deal and we had a giggle over it, no harm done. But it just felt like such a classic ADHD moment.   What little mishaps have you and your partner encountered?

Not because I want to, man do I not want to, but because it’s the only way they’ll ever be made. Then I do the labor associated with that choice. Then, fairly frequently, my adhd partner will come to me and let me know that he doesn’t like the choice I made. Maybe its me, but it feels like he’s pissed that I didn’t consider his side of things fully before making the choice. I try to stay calm and ask him what his alternative suggestion is. He thinks this is unreasonable. That he should be able to object without ‘having all the answers on the spot.’ Now he says he’s ‘terrified’ to voice any concerns because I’ll get visibly angry and then demand he have all the answers.   Anyone else experience this? How do you navigate this? Seriously? I want him to have a say of course - it’s our life. Our family. But it feels unfair to voice vague objections after the fact when you have no intention of doing the work that would be involved in changing the course.   Today was about us moving. Ive been the o to one organising finding a place, have found an area that I think is perfect and gotten aggressive about finding a place there, and now he’s upset that he’ll be 5 minutes further away from his friends and favorite golf courses. This happens for little things to and is just a huge issue for me. For instance, I’ll make dinner for a month and he’ll then complain that ‘we’ eat out too much and are just typical unhealthy lazy Americans (my husband is European, so this is a big insult, etc). Like, I’ll make 25 home cooked organic dinners and we’ll eat out once a week and the first time we eat out twice he’s all over how terrible ‘we’ are with cooking. When in get mad because he’s basically saying that I need to step up more (when I do kind of **everything**), he acts outraged and says that he’s aiming the comment at both of us equally. This is such BS but I’ve never been able to convince him of that.   I care about what he thinks and want him to feel free to express his opinion - but it feels completely unfair to shoulder me with all the responsibility and then complain about how I take care of it.   Please tell me some of you have found ways to address this? Because it’s been 8 years and I’ve tried every thing I can think of.   Thanks for reading.

My wife of 20 years has ADHD and, I suspect, rejection dysphoria (DX - diagnosed nine months ago and medicated). We have three children. I suspect one has ADHD too.   I love her and she has some amazing qualities but I’m broken by our marriage. I desperately want her to get better but we’ve been in couples’ counselling for three years, she’s had individual ADHD counselling for 12 weeks, and I feel like we’re just not getting better enough.   I want to say again that there’s so much to love about her before I say the rest. She doesn’t listen, she lies, she forgets things, she rages sometimes, hates me, is sarcastic with me, interrupts me constantly, ignores me, makes awful comments in front of people and sometimes just gleefully (metaphorically) tears me apart.   She desperately want to improve but just can’t seem to sustain anything for more than three days.   The only time she seems interested in me is when our relationship is in trouble. She’ll do just enough to calm things down then lose focus and forget to bother any more.   She desperately wants to be loved and to feel safe. I want her to have those things but, after her last 36-hour-long meltdown a few weeks ago, I look at my life and wonder why I’m here in this relationship.   She’s not my child but I often feel like that’s our dynamic. Just recently I’m looking at it all again and wondering why on earth I’m staying.   I feel broken by 20 years of undiagnosed ADHD but more broken by the hope I had when she was diagnosed followed by a creeping realisation that this remains very unpredictable and very hard.   I love her. I want to give her a loving and safe home. But I’m so exhausted and broken by her.  I don’t know what to do.   Thank you for reading this.
ca5185ba1c523051a41adae16733f31f8c65739e93e77975e4a424308e9bff1d;;;Diagnosed Partner’s Ability to Provide Support in Times of Hardship;;;My (29F) husband (diagnosed and medicated 29M) is having a really hard time effectively providing support to me in times of hardship. I had a really difficult counseling session yesterday where my therapist suggested that I begin taking medication for the anxiety and depression that she is noticing that I have developed as a result of being a chaotic relationship for the past 6 years.   I felt absolutely spent after my therapy session and my husband noticed and asked me what was wrong. I told him that my therapist is recommending medication at this point and I expressed that I was feeling very upset about this because this relationship is now having such serious consequences on my mental health that I require medication. I have been warning my husband for years that I would eventually reach this point if nothing in our relationship changed.  This is after years of me providing accommodations for his disability and trying to help him find effective strategies for managing his ADHD. He now has a therapist with a background in ADHD, as well as a psychiatrist, but we still have issues with his ability to remember to stay dedicated to the improvement of our relationship.   He ran out to pick up food for us after this conversation and when he returned he was visibly distraught and run-down looking. He told me that he wouldn’t be able to watch a show with me and he pulled out his laptop and put on an episode of his anime show. I perceived this as his using a negative coping mechanism to receive a dopamine boost while also escaping the issue. I became overwhelmed with emotion and started crying. I think it hit me in that moment that I do not have a partner whom I can share my feelings with, without there being a serious guilt response in which he ends up taking up all of the room. His RSD just cannot handle anything that he perceives as criticism.   Every single time I initiate a discussion about the imbalance in our relationship, he brings up that his needs aren’t being met and I explain to him that the root of these issues is his ADHD and that a lot his needs not being met has everything to do with the fact that I don’t have the desire to be intimate with someone who doesn’t keep up with their hygiene, and behaves in the way that child or surly teenager would. I firmly believe that if he was able to better manage his ADHD, that any issues around intimacy would be resolved.   My husband also has some serious trauma and neglect from from his childhood. He also grew up in hoarded house. His therapist describes the aforementioned as a “double whammy” when combined with his ADHD. We’ve recently been searching for a couple’s therapist who specializes in ADHD, but we haven’t yet found one.   I guess my question is, is it unreasonable of me to ask that my husband work on reaching a place where he can serve as an emotional support to me without it turning into a severe depressive episode for him? He just keeps saying that he is tired today, and I find myself feeling exhausted with the pattern of almost feeling sorry for even bringing anything up to him.

Vacuum, garbage (when remembered), recycling (when remembered), yard (when it's gotten to) are the household tasks my (dx) husband and his brother who livea with us share.  I hate vacuuming and now we have a dog and cat... As you guessed, vacuuming never gets done... So I bought myself a roomba. I saw it at Costco for $80 off and got it. It will make me happy and hubby happy! Totally worth it.
b5a157efcc1635fd5bcfb920437397470d90d702bec714646f9d6cdaca846293;;;IDK how I can possibly stay sane throughout these next 4.5 months;;;I want my boyfriend out of my life. I can't deal with all his untreated ADHD bullshit anymore. I have spent nearly every spare moment of my life for the past 3 years trying absolutely everything to make this relationship work and he has provided me nothing in return.   In 3 years I haven't gotten a single sincere apology, not a single sincere thank you, not a single strategy presented by him on how to make *anything* better. I feel like a fucking shell of myself.   It feels like he understands me as well as a someone I met 10 minutes ago would with zero interest in learning beyond that.   I literally feel that I am just filling the the "girlfriend slot" in his life but could put any woman at all in my place. As long as they let him "do what he wants when he wants", "loves him for him", and can drop every ounce of respect they have for themselves he'd be happy with them.  I have gone back on every single boundary I've ever made in this relationship because he flat out refuses to budge an inch on anything.   I don't remember what being loved feels like. The best I've gotten is the cute things a crush would do when they are trying to peruse you...surface level niceties.   I hear from people quite often of how relaxed and easy going a person I am. Well my BF pushes me to such a heightened state of frustration and exhaustion and despair that I started self harming when we'd fight because I felt like I was trying to work through problems with an angry brick wall. He cared about that...for a little while.    The only reason I have called out of work in the past two years is because of anxiety and depression that I've always had but only rises to intense levels due to situations involving him.   Our roommate is trying to move out early because she doesn't want to be in this toxic house any more than we do. She has gone from a friend of mine and a best friend of his to an enemy who doesn't even look us in the eyes. This falling out is due in large part to my BF because his contradictory people pleaser lies indirectly caught up with him.  We have 4.5 months left of our lease to ride out. If/when this roommate leaves we will have to absorb her rent but it's better than breaking the lease and moving in elsewhere.  We already have a vacation half planned to California a month from now. Naturally I have gotten no assistance on planning this but he has still already paid for half the trip and I cannot afford to last minute end up going on vacation alone...again.   I am so devastated that I loved this person enough to start dealing with my own issues because I felt like he deserved the best and he opened my eyes to my areas of improvement. He is the reason I ended up being diagnosed with ADHD myself. I am not important enough for him to open his though. It was always one sided.   I hate my BF for allowing me to spend my life trying everything under the sun to deal with his rampant ADHD knowing that he wouldn't put an ounce of effort into any of it himself. I don't hate the forgetfulness, I hate his view that it's not something to improve. I don't hate the sudden defensiveness, I hate being told it's an appropriate response and never hearing an apology or seeing a hint of remorse in him.  I didn't fall out of love with a man with ADHD I fell out of love with an asshole who is intentionally remaining in a state of emotionally stuntedness because it's easier to date a new girl every couple years and say "if they can't love me for me then they don't belong in my  life" than it is for him to face himself.   I am a rambling mess and have no idea how I can survive any of this.
d8842ededaea78a77ab571c4aa6c4b95b7e706c82634f38e98f8f687ddd013d1;;;I'm really proud of myself;;;My partner (ADD, unmedicated) and I were (trying to) discussing an issue. I disagreed with his approach, and was trying to explain my reasoning and research. Little did I know, he was in no place to entertain a cerebral discussion. Out of nowhere, he became super angry and frustrated. I just left him alone because it was clear that he didn't have the bandwidth for that kind of interaction at that time.  I am finally able to see his (very infrequent) blow-ups as an ADD issue. I gave him space, and he calmed down and we proceeded to have a normal day. I'm proud of myself for not trying to force resolution, recognizing that he needed some space to self-regulate, and not taking it personally. And I'm proud of him for getting back to resolving the issue and eventually fixing the problem on his own.

We get up before then, of course, and have coffee, get ready for work, etc. But until they take their medication, they are unbearable and annoying. I try to take my time in the rest room and dress slooooooowly to avoid them, all the while thinking, "I cannot *wait* until you take your meds!"   If I only really like the medicated version of my partner, do I really love them?

And I'm done.

ed2222eb96cb34c827c4eb577d8e0ec58dd27049c505c40b322349eb1ad32f68;;;Bringing Myself Back;;;(TL;DR at bottom) me-F31 NT Him-34M NDX Ntx Ok, I’m regularly going through this group, searching old phrases reading posts from months and months ago etc.   I know a lot of us can relate to the fact that who we were prior to the relationship (for example: I felt fun free confident in charge of my life) slow faded away after years of fights. While dating we almost broke up over fights. I now know it was his RSD but that don’t change anything. Hurt still hurt. I wasn’t used to arguments and yelling and nasty comments.   My parents didn’t fight in front of me (I was a super sensitive kid and would freak out n hide under tables). My dad had/has undx untx ADHD so he also had quick triggers but was older and more tired by the time I came along. I mostly got the emotionally unavailable side and you never knew when he would randomly lose his crap, but it was pretty rare (mostly happened in my teens).  His parents scream and yelled and called each other everything but the son of God. His mother (who passed away before we met) seems like she was the emotionally unstable one, bad temper, impulsive, verbally abusive. He has other close family members who have really nasty, disrespectful fights. So this was all normal for him.  But it wasn’t for me. And I told him when we were dating that every nasty fight like that would break me just a little bit. And when I almost left, the fights stopped! I believed when he said he would change and be better. And they did! Until after we were engaged and right before the wedding. I knew what I was getting into. I made my bed, I accept that. I married my dad. The fights and nasty comments are so much better than they were, but I think that first year really broke me. Then the losing interest in me a couple years later broke me further.  My question is, have any of you ever found your way back to the old you while still with your partner? I’m in therapy and I’ve shopped around therapists looking for one to help *me* and not try to therapy him through me (it’s actually pretty difficult idk why, they all just wanna get their hands on him). Was there a specific type of therapy that worked for you? Do I need to see someone who specializes in ADHD?  . TL;DR I miss the old pre ADHD partner me, is getting back possible without leaving them?

He working really really hard to make changes to help but I know I have some work to do also to get out of this role. I want to acknowledge his effort by putting effort in as well (not that this whole marriage has not required effort).  Does anyone have any books, videos, articles that helped them get past this dynamic? Bonus points if it helps with the sexual intimacy issues that come with this.

He's in his mid 30s and undiagnosed/unmedicated. Just recently realized what's been afflicting him his entire life is ADHD.  Since day one, we've had countless fights. Explosive. Brutal. I've wanted to leave since the beginning, but he would always gaslight me, guilt-trip me into staying.   Yesterday he locked us both in a room during a fight and wouldn't let me out. He took my phone. He spat on me multiple times. I hit him when he blocked my way out the door.  I had enough. Finally, when I got out, I went to the neighbour and asked him to call the police to come escort me. Unfortunately that also resulted in him getting arrested.   I'm freaking out to a bit now. I'm scared he'll hurt himself. I don't know what to do to protect him but I can't be with him any longer...

That mindset seems self-defeating. How can you ever grow or improve if you simply “can’t”? Maybe I am just being a naive little neurotypical, but I believe in the brain’s plasticity and ability to change.  My issue is really that whenever I try to talk to my partner about something she is struggling with in an attempt to find some way to help manage or strategize, she deflects and avoids. Just today we were talking about getting up in the morning and how she “will just go back to sleep” if I don’t turn on enough lights. Her language and tone are just so 100% positive that she will fail at getting herself up. I just wish she could shift her tone more towards, “ADHD makes it harder for me to do some things”. I worry that her ADHD diagnosis has given her an excuse to stop trying. As if she has reasoned that, “Oh I guess I have no control since ADHD is behind the wheel and I’m just along for the ride.”  Am I silly for wanting her to fight for herself more?

We have 4 kids 12 and under, 2 with adhd, as well as him. He is a good guy with good intentions, but he will never be able to give me the help I wish so badly I could have. He is the breadwinner and does work hard for us, but I literally do everything else. Everything. From all the yard work, cleaning up the garage, fixing things that break, bills, chores, kids and the list is endless. When I'm struggling or mentally and physically exhausted I can't talk to him about it, bc he immediately gets stressed out about it.(I don't talk to him in way to ask for help or blame, just merely talking about things) I do all the bills and sometimes I like to run through our expenses and budget, but he can't do it without freaking out, so I feel like I have to carry that burden alone. I'm so exhausted of being the brain for 6 people. It's so hard. He is against ever hiring for help (like someone to mow the lawn) but sometimes I do while he is at work bc I just can't single handedly do it all. I dont see a light at the end of my tunnel. I am happy  in general but Im also so so burnt out. I cant have this conversation with him, he would probably be nice, if done right, and vow to do better, but he just never does do better. I dont blame him, I know his brain works differently, but how do I lighten my load without a helpful spouse? How do I see my light? How do accept that I run the show and always will. I'd love nothing more than for him to take me out and him plan it, but that will never happen. I'd even love if he would just make me dinner, or cookies! Or just see that I'm helping 4 kids by myself while he is sitting on his phone. When I do ask for help, he just says, "what? Everybody is fine." It seems impossible for him to naturally help with anything. I know I have to support him and help him, but Im tired of that, it takes SO much energy, I feel like I need a break from constantly helping and supporting him. I want a break from having to live in his life in his adhd world...Anyway, I dont know what I'm looking for exactly, just a little glimmer of hope I suppose. Thanks for reading if you made it this far.

Even if I don't post, I come here to read your posts, so that I don't feel so alone and misunderstood at times. Sometimes I ask for help and others, I try to give my "five cents" on your posts.   Today, I came here to share with you a resource that probably most of you know already. But if you don't and this helps you as much as it helps me, then I am happy.   [How to ADHD](https://howtoadhd.com/) started as a Youtube channel, created by Jessica McCabe, who was diagnosed with ADHD as a child and has been dealing with it her all life. Me and my partner found out about her channel, after watching her Ted Talk: [Failing at Normal: An ADHD Success Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiwZQNYlGQI). It was actually because of this talk that my partner ended up being diagnosed with ADHD. If you have never seen it, please do.   Jessica's videos are incredibly helpful, in my opinion. First, they are very educative and, foremost, research-based. There is a lot of misinformation about ADHD out there and I honestly think she does a very good job fighting it back.   Her videos also help me on a whole other level though. As non-ADHD partners, we take on a whole lot:  it is not uncommon for us to end up taking most of the family's chores and responsibilities. Frustration, impatience and resentment build up and it is incredibly hard to not take things personally. After a while, it becomes difficult to be patient or to feel empathy for our SO because most of the times, we are the ones dealing with most of the shi#$y downsides of ADHD.   Our feelings are justified, and that is why her videos are helpful to me. Personally, having someone else openly speaking about the ADHD struggles, somehow makes me feel more generous towards my partner. Maybe it is because he himself doesn't share most of his feelings/frustrations regarding his own ADHD, I somehow find Jessica to be his voice sometimes and it becomes easier to understand his behaviour.   I am sure some of you will disagree and that is okay. Each one of us finds our own way to cope with our partner's ADHD and to fight for our relationships, with its ups and downs. I just thought that, nevertheless, this was a nice source of information to share with you and, again, if it helps one of you, as much as it helps me, then it is worth it :) Have a great day!

I love my partner but there was over a year and a half period where I felt like his mom.  I turned from the relaxed and fun person I was to nitpicky and frustrated. It's gotten better in the last few months so maybe I will feel differently if things stay this way for a while. He is now accepting of his ADHD and wants to get diagnosed, but is still reluctant to consider meds. I'm letting him take his time and not pushing him.   We want to have the "kids" conversation but I don't know what to say. The chances of us having kids with ADHD would probably quite high, and on top of a forgetful partner, I am afraid to be the only responsible adult taking care of the household.  I think he wants kids but doesn't see all of the work, he only thinks about the fun aspects. I have thought about adoption and I was basically adopted, but I always envisioned it with someone I could rely on a bit more. Even when he tries his best I have to double check everything because half the time it isn't done. I don't know how to bring up these concerns with him without making him feel terrible.

I recently found this sub and honestly the support and conversation has been really helpful. First time posting and on mobile so please forgive any formatting!  Basically, my partner and I have been together for 4.5 years, known each other for almost 9. We're also really really good friends on top of our relationship. One thing we've struggled with though is intimacy. He has quite severe adhd, and he gets very overloaded when it comes to physical sensation. This is not just sex, but touching, hugging, even when it comes to fabrics it needs to be a certain feel to it or else he gets extremely agitated and distressed.   This has impacted our sex life, and it's honestly left me feeling lonely and insecure. I know this isn't his fault, and I want to be compassionate. I want to work through this with him, but I'm not sure where to start. I was wondering has anyone else gone through this?   Thank you for reading!

Being the partner with ADHD many things have been trial and error.   But some of our biggest successes have come from a book called Fast Minds.  It has tips for people With ADHD and tips for people who know someone with ADHD.  It helps understanding for both sides and provides things for both parties to do.   Additional note:  Some community members from r/ADHD are reading this book as a "book club" so to speak to discuss topics.  If anyone would like to be a part as an active participant or to be a fly on the wall and see how we function and discuss please feel free to message me and we will coordinate.  :)  Edit: If your DX/NDX wants to join they are welcome!  But for the best of the group and the DX/NDX please do not attempt to make anyone join.   - anyone is welcome to just see/add ideas  - To join shoot me a message and I'll add you in!

How do I get through this?;;;I'm tired. I'm tired of the tables being turned on me, the arguments, things not getting done unless they're important to him, the uncertainty of whether he'll be interested in an hour, the shutting me out, the emotional roller coaster...I'm just tired.   He won't go to therapy or get help because of his family's negative views of it. He has said that when we move out (which he has made no effort to help me with, despite the fact I've been asking for help since January and my lease is up in July) he'll go. I don't know whether to count on that.   He had a bad experience with ADHD medicine a few years back and doesn't want to try it again. I get that, but I feel like he should at least be going somewhere to get help other than medicine. I get help for my depression because I know I can be a wrecking ball if I don't have weekly therapy and I want better for him AND myself.   I have been having such a hard mental day. He called to check on me, then said that he doesn't understand why I'm having a hard day and am so stressed, then said nothing seems to be getting better. Naturally, that just stressed me out more.   He told me he'd apply for jobs today to ease the stress of trying to apply to apartments. He didn't. He hasn't helped me look anywhere, even though he said he would. My renewal date for my current place has passed because he told me, "Don't renew, I want to live with you. We'll figure it out by then." He always asks what he can do, I tell him exactly what would help me (ex. applying for jobs so he can at least be taking interviews in June), and he doesn't do it and asks why I'm so upset and says it doesn't make sense.   I'm tired of shouldering the weight. I'm about to just let it all fall down and crash. I love him so, so much...how do I get through this? Can I get through this?
d20e19bbf9bbdabac63bd2ff968c581a53e8e4c35861239c715b00e6aeb8ee88;;;He apologized;;;This maybe aught to go in the weekly victories thread, but I also felt that this tale came with a valuable message.  My husband has this annoying learned behaviour of seeking to pacify someone when upset, even more so with me, I would guess because he can't handle seeing me hurt. I get it, but it's not the right way to go about things sometimes.  Well, yesterday marked thr 9th year of my dad passing, so I tried to keep busy and the usual. My husband asked me to talk about him; memories and things. I tried, but there's no much good stuff from my own past, and before I knew it, I was snot crying and in a mess. Instead of consoling me, he moved to pacify me.  I felt particularly vulnerable in that moment, as I hadn't ever said these things outloud, so it took it's toll on me. I got triggered, it didn't end well.   But it did end better than any other time something like this happened.  No shouting, no screaming. He did not push me once to talk to him. (previously would do anything to get me to react to him out of fear I suppose). He gave me my space, didn't react to my own sharp tongue, which means I also wasn't put in a position to say horrible things to make a point.   I woke up this morning feeling pretty low, and upon reflection, because he handled himself well, I was able to get my thoughts in order. I sent him a message outlining the main issue:  "I listen to you vent a lot, sometimes for hours, and when i was having a moment you sought to pacify me, after we literally had a conversation about how your mum does that to you. It's just not cool. i had never vocalized any of that to anyone in my life, not even anna, so i didn't know it would even upset me so bad. i didnt even know it was there. anyway, gonna try and work out to see if it helps me feel better because it's just not healthy for me to be feeling so low like this."  Even though he was at work, he called me back immediately.  He told me he understood completely what he had done, it wasn't his intention, he did not mean to hurt my feelings, and that I was right, and he will work harder on listening, and active listening. (there was more to it, but you get the idea)  There was no backpedaling, no anger, no trying to justify himself, no making it my problem; just pure acknowledgment of a mistake, and being quite remorseful for that mistake.  So guys and gals, if you know, you know. This just doesn't happen. Ever. There's always a fight about him not taking accountability for what he's done. The denial, the "No that's not it!". None of it was there this time.  The releif I felt in that moment was just.. I can't even tell you.  To see and understand that kind of progress from someone, I was just lost for words.  I wanted to share this with you all who might be struggling to work at your relationships, as there is a light at the end of the tunnel. There is hope.   Communication, respect, boundaries - all of these things help give a person enough foundation that they can manage them selves, grow, and learn.  Happy Friday everyone!

As an ADHD wife, with a non-ADHD partner; I have recently decidEd to get treated with medication again. Although the medication helps on many levels, it doesn't do everything. *Because it is only of recent, within the last few weeks that I have learned how deeply ADHD behaviours have affected my marriage - I just want to share my thoughts and understandings at this juncture*. Of course this is just from my point of view but it may shed some light on what's going on inside our minds and at least help me get this off my chest.  **ADHD : no medication, when the meds wear off**  * We are constantly changing our minds and that's just us * **We don't intend to hurt you** or others by what we say, forget or don't say * We are very **emotional and overly reactive** \- but I assure you, once when we get upset and say something we don't mean, after some time - after we actually are able to cool off - we will usually see somewhat rationally again and say what we do mean. The intensity on how deeply we feel emotion is about 10x-20x how deeply you feel an emotion. * **We have no idea how much we live in awareness we have**  \- we are literally constantly distracted or daydreaming even if we think we are focusing * We are great at putting the **mask on of "normality"** and although we may get used to it - we are struggling inside in ways most cannot imagine. It zaps us of energy * **We are operating on auto-pilot**. We literally are a series of conditioned reactions. Not because we want to, but because until we are diagnosed and take action for some sort of treatment (medication, behavioural or both) - we have no idea that this is happening * When we are crying, upset or in a emotionally vulnerable state, **please don't give us advise - just listen to us compassionately.** Wait until we are calm and better to offer any advice. * You may feel like you don't really know us because we can't properly communicate our thoughts * **We may text you or interrupt a lot** **in conversation**\- but that's because we want to share something before we forget it. * Self confidence is usually low for us - and a chronic condition. Just as are negative thoughts. * **We aren't lying** If it seems like we are lying, you have to understand that because our emotions and thoughts change so rapidly - we often have a different perception when answering your question the first time than the second time. Or we just freaking forgot. Our perceptions, and therefore related memories, change with our moods (which are related to our changing thoughts)  **ADHD :** **with medication/recently began being treated**  * **Give us some time to get used to our new working brains**. We are now processing things differently and beginning to see things with fresh eyes. * **ACCEPTANCE**. Please also give us some time to accept this entire ADHD diagnoses and the treatment. There is so much social stigma with it that it can be hard to swallow. For me, I have spent time looking back and seeing how many people I inadvertently hurt and have gone through periods of grief too. We may be relentlessly researching to understand ADHD, but understanding and learning is key for us to move on to acceptance * **Meds are only part of the solution** \- and that's if we can get them right. We also need to re-learn some habits that may not be addressed with medication; procrastination - how to organise - how to communicate - how to listen and a zillion other things. Your support is also invaluable and I ask that you all take the time to educate yourselves. * **The meds wear off** (psycho-stimulants) - and when they wear off, our ADHD comes back immediately (see first part of post). Until we get used to this and find/learn coping mechanisms this will happen  and/or the proper treatment has been found (duration of optimal efficacy with little or no side effects). It has to wear off sometime, or we may be up too late at night. * **If we behave differently** please let us know. * **Remind us to be patient with ourselves.** Even with meds we still have this hardwired need for perfection and to get things done NOW. We aim for that even harder with meds sometimes. Remind us about this. * **We may re-evaluate life and see things from a new point of view because we are finally able to truly be self aware and introspect for the first time.**  EDITS OCTOBER 6, 2018:  * If we are trying a new med/dosage and end up staying up later than usual (or sleeping earlier), don't give us crap - our bodies need to adjust. * If you have an important message you need us to attend to - please take us away from our daily environments to stimulate and emphasize that "this is important". The same surroundings can lead to day dreaming. * If we discover new hobbies, nurture us - learn with us. We haven't had working brains in a while and when they do work, we discover life. * Try not to force us to talk about anything, suggest something smaller first or a letter (email) * Help us create systems that work for us, not mold us into systems that work for you. * We process language differently than neurotypicals so clarification on both parties is often needed * Sit down and communicate with us, not just talk. Let's Have a conversation.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;
c94bd35cde3787bcfec05bcc472307efd772a2cf47c377c6adba732b742594a0;;;Do you ever regret saying things you really mean?;;;We all reach the end of our ropes. My wife HATES saying that she has ADHD. She was diagnosed as a teen and refuses to believe that she has it. She blames it on her neglected upbringing. Admittedly, she was very neglected. There’s a lot of trauma from her childhood that she refuses to deal with. But I know her father. There is no way he would ever be able to talk a doctor into giving a fake diagnosis like that. And at the time, a girl being diagnosed was almost unheard of. When I bring up that she probably does have it and that we should address it. She completely shuts down and refuses to even talk about. She said it hurt her that I would think that about her   My response was ‘get over it, that’s what you tell me to do’ She brought it up that I would told her that 6 weeks ago, it was two but that’s not the point.   I feel bad about telling her that. But also, I meant it.  I don’t want to play by different rules that I have to just deal with her lack of impulse control, and her neglectfully meandering though life. While I pick up the pieces behind her.   What have you said you feel about about but it was true.
db7a4a7c5cb3947f0d45449ccb7ad03e66f3efda05d20979f8bb75d53f34f895;;;Small victories...;;;My husband (dx adhd, meds but inconsistent) and I (dx ptsd, anxiety and depression) have been struggling more than usual lately with chore division and responsibilities etc. We’ve had many arguments and conversations about it before but nothing changed.   And then, yesterday, this man rinsed and put his used dishes in the dishwasher. Took out the trash. Fed the cat. Cleared the snow off the cars. Made the bed. Replaced the toilet paper roll. Wiped his spills. Cleared the counters. Put his clothes inside the hamper. ALL WITHOUT BEING PROMPTED OR REMINDED!! No lists, no conversation or arguments about it recently. He just did it. And that behavior seems to be continuing again today.   I know the cycle will continue and he will regress again, and struggle again, but this is a first for us and it makes me hopeful that one day we will find a working balance in this. Still a long road ahead of us, but man am I proud of him today.

Think ADHD, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Dyslexia and other learning disabilities. The mission is to shift societal thinking away from the norm of "people with disabilities" to one that celebrates neurodiversity.   In our winter issue, we're focusing on the theme of dating and relationships, and the unique struggles neurodivergent people face. We're especially interested in stories where only one partner is neurotypical. We'd love to hear stories from you, and/or your partners, about what it's like. Even if you don't consider yourself a writer. Hoping some of you will contribute. The magazine is online and in print, and you can see guidelines here:  [https://www.divergents-magazine.org/submissions](https://www.divergents-magazine.org/submissions)  Hope to hear from you!

And I just have to say.....  &#x200B;  I never knew. I didn't know that there were others out there. Who had partners like mine, and are able to so accurately describe how I have felt in situations. The hurt and the frustration, but also the strength and the immense sense of understanding. I'm tearing up cuz now I'm not alone.   &#x200B;  I do have a question or several... My spouse (35M - DX Medicated) and I (30F - DX not Medicated) have been together for almost a decade. And we both have grown and learned alot in that time, but now I'm questioning what behaviors do I just need to accept... how do I know when I'm asking too much of my partner? And how do I get him more active in our daily life? I love my partner desperately, he has the kindest heart, and when he's off his meds he's super funny and quirky (while being a little chaotic) and I really want to do what is best for the both of us, but it's hard to know when I'm pushing something that's worth pushing, and when I need to just accept I'm pushing against a brick wall, and maybe even doing more harm than good. I'm just stumped.   &#x200B;  But I'm glad to know I'm not alone in these struggles!
ca5185ba1c523051a41adae16733f31f8c65739e93e77975e4a424308e9bff1d;;;Partner applying newly learned psychological terms to our conversations...;;;This is my first time posting here, but I think I've read just about every post in this sub.   Anyway, my (29F) husband (Dx and medicated 29M) and I had quite an explosive argument last night. Lately, I've been feeling very neglected in our relationship. I feel that there is a severe imbalance and that I am basically here to meet his needs (i.e. manage his ADHD when he doesn't, cook, clean, manage the household, etc.). He doesn't deny the imbalance in his more rational moments, but his RSD makes it extremely difficult for me to discuss any of my concerns with him. I explained to him that even though his actions are often involuntary or unintentional, they can still cause me to feel emotional or upset, especially if they hurt my feelings. He often in these moments accuses me of trying to make him feel guilty, or bad when in actuality I am just sharing my feelings. This leaves me feeling like I have to accept the consequences of his ADHD quietly, which leads to more resentment.   I feel like he takes up so much room in our relationship that there is very little space left for me. He finally started seeing a therapist who specializes in ADHD about 8 months ago, and this was after years of me begging him to be more assertive in his ADHD treatment (i.e. medication, therapy, ADHD tools, etc.). I feel like we have so much potential right now because I too have a good therapist that I am working with to try and sort out some depression and anxiety that I have developed as a result of being in this relationship. I am so happy that he is getting quality intervention, but he has recently started applying terms from his therapy to me and I can't help but feel that he is most times missing this mark on his assessment of specific behaviors because of his gaps in attention, social awkwardness, and overall lack of observational skills.   We had a conversation and he told me that he believes that I mind read a lot. This is a term that his therapist brings up a lot with him, only he thinks mind reading is occurring when I literally comment on a specific behavior that hurts my feelings. An example of this is when we are having a conversation and he tells I am upset and tearful, he will shut down emotionally and become very curt and short in his responses, and he might even interrupt me to say "ok", where a neurotypical person might apologize or offer comfort. I'll comment on this being hurtful to me, and he'll tell me that I am mind reading and assuming that he is doing something that he is not.   These moments are especially frustrating because I am already upset, but also because I feel invalidated, and it seems like he's attempting to shift the attention away from what I am trying to share with him. At some point tonight, he asked me why I am emotional about behaviors that occur as a result of his ADHD, and I used the example that if he were to forget my birthday due to ADHD, I would understand that ADHD was the cause of him forgetting, but it would still be very hurtful to me because I wouldn't feel acknowledged on a special day.   I'm not even sure what I am writing this for, I think it's to speak to people who can relate but to also maybe hear feedback. Please be kind, as this is my first post to Reddit and it's a little scary for me.
51bf2f6f5c08ebd01998054d8cabaf3026166d92e53daabdec15e459b8045a8b;;;Tips for empathizing with ADHD partner;;;My ADHD husband just told me that he tries very hard to empathize with me, but he feels like I don’t try to empathize with him at all. And it makes him feel like I don’t think he’s worth trying to empathize with.  I’m at a loss because 1) I truly can’t understand some of his reactions that are filtered through his ADHD / depressive lens, and 2) I’m sick of trying to understand where he’s coming from. But I want to stay married and keep our family together, so this is something I must do.   For background, I almost left him due to his terrifying emotional, angry outbursts that made me feel physically unsafe. This on top of emotional neglect, being a disengaged husband & father, and bringing a depressive cloud to sit on top of the household.  Because of this, he has been in intensive treatment for his ADHD and depression for around 8 months, and I am so proud of all the work he has done and improvements he has made. However, things are not perfect and of course never will be.  Part of my therapy has been to stop trying to be his at-home psychologist. I have let go of responsibility for his emotions, which has been a huge positive shift for me. Kind of like in Al Anon when you lovingly detach and stop counting the drinks your alcoholic loved one is drinking.   But on the other hand our marriage counselor is trying to encourage me to take responsibility for my role in our fights / arguments, and I find it almost impossible. I feel like I’m just constantly reacting to problems he is creating. And I don’t think I’m wrong. I’m sure this feeling is understood by this community.  So my question is... how do I have empathy for my ADHD husband??
bafda2c8e12894c335301c2f89f8f21400d83dfd083be2271293e1ae2ea0f95c;;;Starting to question if it’s worth it to keep pushing through the pain;;;DX You can read my post history if you want more background, I just need to briefly vent right now and ask for some advice. I love my boyfriend with everything in me but I can’t stand his flaws. I’m so miserable and the fact that nothing he does wrong is necessarily his fault makes me want to vomit because if I leave him for things he can’t control I will never forgive myself. I have no friends in real life and I don’t talk to my family about my relationship so I have nowhere to turn if we do split up. We have been together for nearly 6 years. I’ve never loved anyone or anything more, but I’m beginning to feel as trapped as I felt when I was a teenager living with my emotionally and verbally abusive parents, and yet all he does is love me. He makes mistakes but I know if the adhd was gone he would do nothing but love me entirely. How do you silence the growing resentment when there seems to be no real solutions to what’s truly eating at you? Are things just dead in the water? I want kids one day but Is it possible to be successful parents when the father is incapable of caring for himself properly? How can I expect him to help care for me and a child? I’m just exhausted.

It's such a huge help to hear each other, hear what works, vent, cry, etc. The session was 10 people, all women, all wives of men with ADHD in various states of help and acceptance. It's made me realize how far my husband and I have come since his diagnosis and medication, and I've learned how to listen to others who talk about it. If you can afford it, please seriously consider attending her next one. It's such a relief to hear others speak about their experiences, and she offers great advice while she leads the sessions.

2ee23a9ecbc7a01176c3c5899e1115cbe9f6b621721aa54177936652fdee97f7;;;Spouse and Kid are killing me;;;I married what I thought was a together, motivated, semi-organized person 20 years ago, and we had a kid 13 years ago. Kid was diagnosed ADHD about 6-7 years ago, at which point spouse announced they also had ADHD.   Every speck of ADHD literature I have read has one piece of advice in common: structure and routines. I am the breadwinner, spouse stopped working when the kid was small, and is now stay at home parent. Which is to say, my own ability to implement structure and routine is limited, as I am literally not present from early morning to early evening. Kid is late to school a couple of times a week, homework doesn't get done, house is a disaster. I come home and spouse is usually sitting in the middle of the mess, kid running wild, homework not done. Most times I just swallow it and start cleaning up the mess, trying to get the kid to do what he needs to do, other times I ask spouse if there's something I can do to help. I go back to the familiar refrain: structure and routines. I can't make you do this but I will help in any way I can. Everything will be easier if you can get into a rhythm, I promise.   This is met by one of two responses. About 25% of the time, it's "I can't do it, I need help, let's work on something together, I promise I'll follow through, please help me." The other 75%, it's "FUCK YOU, BACK OFF, I'M AN ADULT." Either way, nothing changes. I work with spouse to create a routine and it gets ignored. We discuss house rules and they are forgotten within days. I point out that kid is breaking a rule Spouse thought of right in front of them, and Spouse acts as though a) they have no idea what I'm talking about and b) I'm an asshole. I've tried every version of helping I can think of: getting super involved, backing way off, everything in between.   And that was before covid. Now Spouse is homeschooling the kid (I could not believe Spouse wanted to do this but I figured it beats paying for super pricey ADHD school that will likely shut down again, and Spouse used to be a teacher), kid is running wild, they are getting maybe an hour of work done per day, kid entirely setting the agenda, while I work from home in the basement. I can see what's happening, and I'm trying to help as best I can, but getting a lot of resentment for interfering. It's like I am parenting both of them, and I don't have the best control of my temper, I find myself doing a lot of yelling when I'm repeating direction (that started out gentle) for the fifth time. Spouse seems to feel that the whole problem with our family is that I'm angry. And I am angry, but I'm not angry at nothing. Kid talks back in a super shitty way when I ask them to do super basic things, it turns into an argument, spouse watches in total silence, and then wants to tell me everything I'm doing wrong.   I saw an article in an advice column recently that said, if I had been able to see my future with this partner I never would have married them, and since then I can't get it out of my mind. I don't want to break up, it's the only thing I can imagine that would make things worse, and believe it or not I really love my spouse -- except as a co-parent. We are a great match, a great couple in most ways, but a terrible match as parents. I am well aware that I have my flaws, it's true I get angrier than I should, but I deeply resent being treated as though the whole problem in our house is that I'm not sucking it up well enough.    How do I get back to sanity? I am finding myself feeling that I hate them both, and like my only recourse is to stop caring -- stop caring if the kid gets educated, stop caring if anything gets done around here, stop caring if the place is a mess.

He’s not talking to me but more at me, and it’s about a range of topics that he read about online and found interesting.  It’s getting to the point that it hurts to hear him talk. I can’t respond to emails, read cooking directions, or silently pay attention to anything while he is in the room without him talking at me.   The problem is that he finds it hypocritical when I ask for some “quiet time” at home but then start talking to him about things like cleaning, planning ahead for joint activities, reminders about things, etc.   How can I communicate the difference between him talking at me instead of to me (sometimes he’ll ask a question but then barrel on over me and thinks that it’s a conversation...), and explain that sometimes I don’t have the bandwidth to engage with his one-sided stream on consciousness but at the same time need to talk to him about adult things?   I dread him waking up or him coming home because regardless of what I’m doing he just starts talking at me.  If I ignore him and keep doing what I’m doing he gets upset and asks if I’m listening and then continues.  It’s starting to drive me crazy, and I’ve noticed myself subconsciously start to avoid him.
c5dad54e7feeeb99ff86ce33a476825d265ce2b7ef6758c70931fea708231254;;;TOO Honest? No empathy.;;;Hi All,    This is my first post here, though I regularly scroll through and read posts and comments which helps immensely in not feeling so alone in this struggle. I am curious as to if any of you struggle with your partner being "too honest" if that makes sense? Or delivering messages with no empathy.  I understand ADHD can lead to strained social manners and anxiety which hes had all his life, but it can still be too much. I'll just give an example that sticks out in my head. This happened the third month into quarantine:   My partner and I are both in pretty incredible shape. We met at a gym. He is a fitness trainer and manager. I am an active gym goer along with pole dance and pilates instructor. Needless to say, without being conceited we both have "nice" figures. With that being said when quarantine first hit and still NOW (though we have found a private gym to workout at) ..both of our places to workout were closed. So I was diligently doing home workouts which of course do not compare to gym workouts and now no longer had 8 hours of dance cardio in my routine. I definitely was no longer as LEAN but definitely still in shape. However, my body holds weight in nice places like my hips and my ass and my waist stayed very snatched so I did not mind the weight, I actually kinda liked it. SO when i was walking by the mirror with him I said "hmm I like me body right now surprisingly." I was not even talking to him. just outloud to myself. And he chimes in "lets be honest though, we've all gained weight since quarantine. Your body is nowhere near in its prime anymore like it used to be."  I blew up and lost my shit and as all of you know with an ADHD partner that goes nowhere. They will always outdo you even if you are dead wrong. he could not fathom what he did wrong. WHAT? DID I SAY SOMETHING THAT WASN'T TRUE? IT WASNT MEANT TO HURT YOUR FEELINGS, JUST A VERY TRUE FACT. DONT BE SO EMOTIONAL. ... yadda yadda. THis happens ALOT and drives me insane. HIs dont be so emotional RANT. AND IM LIKE you have ADHD.. you are the most emotional you just dont see it. ughghghghghghgh I SERIOUSLY SERIOUSLY WISH HE COULD SEE HOW DIFFICULT AND EVEN HURTFUL HE CAN .. DO ANY OF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCES LIKE THIS
de56dbf0def89ac27fed0f55640d988f653a2d1b9ba4500b6ab76caacee0404c;;;Family Planning;;;Hi, I'm new here, this is my first time posting and I'm sorry if this is really long...   My partner (DX, 33M, taking medication since childhood) and I (29F) have been together for five years and married for 2 years.  I am responsible for most of our lifestyle tasks such as paying bills, cleaning the house, cooking, caring for our pet cat, and keeping us on task/on schedule. He works very hard as a software engineer, and we are still trying to find a way that works for him to support me in our day to day chores and responsibilities. My partner has beautiful qualities about him, he's creative smart and funny. He also lets me down a lot, even though he doesn't mean to.   Recently, we have been discussing when we'd like to have a kid together, and I am truly concerned that it would overload me, because I wouldn't have the support of my partner. If the life we've lived together so far is any indicator of the distribution of the responsibilities and how they'll be divided with a baby, I think I would be miserable. It's hard for me to express this to him without hurting his feelings. When I tell him things about himself that he can't control, he shuts down and just plays video games all night.   Even when we talk about having a kid, while he tries to assure me he wants a baby, he's so fixated on the fact that he'll lose sleep during those early months (he has sleep apnea and really poor sleep hygiene). I am learning not to take his fixation as him being selfish or making the conversation about him, but it's hard not to feel concerned when that's the top of mind thought he has around having a kid. I also understand having a baby's not a cakewalk, I work in early childhood and have cared for infants for years.   Overall, I'd love to know if anyone has had to navigate this conversation or even the process of getting pregnant and figuring it out with their partner?   What worked and what didn't? Anything helps!   &#x200B;  Thank you EDIT: I just want to say I had no idea how supportive and validating posting here would be. I feel really strong and cared for in this community. Thank you to everyone who courageously shared their experiences and gave advice. I’m so grateful!
ad84bd4088c75d7c6eca53b3fb2df2ba1e0a0abdd2425744ea446bdd777551ba;;;Is there a possible way I can bring more balance into my life? I hyperfocus on things so hard that everything and everyone else in my life gets neglected - children, pets, food, spouse, payments, chores;;;I have ADHD. Although undiagnosed i know it for a fact that it is 200% it. My entire life can be summed up by a timeline of series of things that I hyperfocussed on and excelled in. But it has come with a cost. Everything and everyone else gets neglected in the bargain - be it children, pets, food, payments, my own health, eating habits etc. I was wondering if there ever is a possibility that i could hope for a way i could have a work around or find a way to balance things just a little bit more. I am tired of hurting people because i got so lost that i forgot i had to put meals on the table. I am tired of disappointing my children especially. For example : they'd come back from school so hungry and hope there would be food in the house but all i did the entire day was scrub and clean and declutter an area of the house - hyperfocussing like a beast. Then when they'd be sad that i was neglecting them, I'd make up by ordering take away food - which is neither healthy, nutritious nor helping my budget.   I really hope some of you'll can help me with some hacks or work arounds you'll learnt along the way and share them with me. I'm desperate to bring some balance into my life so this mountain of guilt i can put it down, it just keeps growing. 😞
56b27f3504d97835a23e78fa26be61b3fe4bcd2b617a710bdd7fbe2c56da750f;;;I’m dying inside..;;;I’m (26f) recently diagnosed w/ ADHD and my husband (24m) non ADHD. We’ve been together for almost 10 years total and it’s been a rough 10 years I was diagnosed at around 20 with fibromyalgia so for years my husband had to help take care of me and now I’ve got my fibromyalgia figured out and don’t need his help.. we’ve always struggled when it comes to arguments I could never communicate right and I always thought it was my fibromyalgia so I kept making promises that I’d figure it out and I could communicate better and nothing I tried worked I still got over emotional couldn’t figure out what was wrong. A month ago I go told by our therapist I have ADHD I’m really realizing that this is why I never could communicate I’d get so confused by the argument and then just start babbling.. after years of or not communicating right my husband resents me he struggles daily with bad thoughts about my ADHD and it’s made it to we’re I loose my emotions they get so high I go crazy panicking and I don’t want him to divorce me but I know I’m pushing him away with my over emotions... it’s like I’m turning our disagreements into a blame game when I just feel like he doesn’t understand me. I’m hopeful going to see a doctor this week I really just want to be medicated so hopefully I can be normal... has anyone else had a really hard time with their marriage... I know this is a mess I just don’t know what to do..

I work at a large law firm and my wife (DX) is a stay-at-home mother. We have four kids under age of 11.  We’ve been married 10 years, but this wasn’t really an issue until about 2 years ago.  I work at a large law firm, which pays well but is stressful and a tad bit soul crushing. It’s not unusual to put in a few 10-12 hour days a week with a normal day of a solid 8-9 hours. It wasn’t until COVID and working from home that I realized how much ADHD was affecting our lives.   I’ve been working from home for about nine months now and seeing my wife on her phone, in bed, or watching TV more often than not is starting to make me bitter.   I’m usually the one to get up in the morning and get the kids ready (my wife has trouble falling asleep at night), and I’m usually the one to get the kids going to bed. I’m also usually the only one of us to do any housework after 7:00pm. We spilt meal prep about 50-50 (less so pre-Covid).  I feel like a jerk because she has been improving and addressing her ADHD. But 2020 has added significant stress to both our lives, and this issue is really festering inside of me.   We’ve tried to have discussions about this, but they seem to be making things worse. She shuts down, and when we can get past her shutting down, the discussion turns to how I need to do better about dealing with her ADHD, which really gets me angry and upset.
9d6ab50131cad7b46bcde45cb2864ffb65a27e3e5dd0d5450bdef5b1ee4bc9c4;;;Blowup, then acting like nothing happened?;;;I've seen this on here a few times and I'm curious to see if it's a common dynamic: does your partner come back 20 minutes/an hour/the next time you see each other after a fight and act like everything is fine (but without resolving anything?!)   For me this is something I experience almost every time we have a huge crying yelling fight and let me tell you, it is CRAZY MAKING. I'll spend all night sad, hurt, thinking of ways to work on whatever went wrong, and the next day Partner will be making jokes and telling me about something funny that happened over the night shift. It's like I'm walking around with a broken leg and he's ignoring it.   Is it a 'let's drop this without confrontation' thing? Is it that they're over the emotions, even if we aren't? Is it avoidance?? Most importantly, what's a good way to handle it without rekindling the fight???

My partner and I have been married for 6 years and he's been treated for ADHD for the last 9. He takes meds and has worked with a therapist in the past, currently doing a more self-help type approach. My question is about responding to hurtful or thoughtless behavior that is ADHD related, and what are reasonable expectations for behavior given that he has a disability. Some examples:  1. My partner has issues integrating information that get worse when there is a lot of distractions or stress. He covers for this often by using rote phrases as responses, and it's obvious to me that he's not actively listening. For example, we were at a somewhat loud bar with several TVs.  My partner kept getting distracted by the TVs and at one point said "that's cool, man!" in response to his friend talking about how their father was having some serious medical issues. I said something like "wait, did you say that your dad needed surgery...?" and my partner snapped to attention and said something like "oh sorry I misheard, is your dad ok?" 2. Sometimes he struggles to speak clearly in stressful situations and it causes conflicts to escalate. Example: I asked him to help secure some shelving that was unsteady. In the process of doing so he knocked one of my plants off the shelf and the pot broke. When I came over and asked if he needed help, he gave me confusing instructions ("Hold the thing over there"), and when I didn't respond how he wanted he got short tempered with me.  I then got really upset with him because I was still processing that my plant was damaged and then he's there yelling at me because HE can't communicate effectively. 3. He can be excessively self-focused. He will talk at length about things he cares about without gauging whether others have lost interest or if he's monopolizing the conversation. He complains bitterly about how bad other drivers are and then does the exact same things himself (example: he gets annoyed when people take too long to pull out of parking spots because they're on their phone, but then will do the same thing). He will have days where he is mostly complaining to me about the same things he finds annoying (drivers, our crappy public transit system, capitalism, etc) and I have to interrupt and tell him "you've just complained about five different things in a row, maybe we could talk about positive things for a while?" It's like negativity is so self-stimulating that he doesn't see/care how draining I find it even though I've told him many times. 4. He doesn't take negative feedback well. For example he keeps forgetting to shut off the stove, I've nicely asked him to be more mindful at least half a dozen times. Well, recently he forgot the stove was on and accidentally put some fabric on the burner and it got burned. Later I tried to talk to him more seriously to ask "what can we do to help you remember when the stove is on?"  He had no suggestions. I offered that a red light comes on when a burner is on and maybe he could pay attention to that. He claimed to have never noticed this light (plausible) but then speculated it was broken (it isn't) and asked me to stop pressing the issue. I told him it's a safety issue and I have a right to express my concerns and worries to him. Why is it so hard to say "Sorry, I'll pay attention to whether the light is on next time"?   I feel like I'm constantly setting boundaries or redirecting behavior, like "if this bar is too distracting for you to hear what's being said, let's relocate" or "please don't yell at me when you just broke my plant" or "you've hit your complaining quota for the day so let's move on" or "I am worried your behavior is unsafe and will not 'just drop it' because I am entitled to my feelings and concerns."   I think this makes him resent me for "correcting" him all the time (hello rejection sensitive dysphoria).  I just don't know what the alternative is. I think ideally he would get some sort of occupational therapy for adults with ADHD but the few centers around us don't take his insurance. I have been encouraging him to get some sort of therapy especially to learn to respond better to negative feedback and he says he's open to it and then doesn't do any follow up.
1153fb0a2341ed0b395891f0b7b0cb74862c55b6cecbbeac2fab2992502189e4;;;Hears things I'm not saying and wallows in shame;;;He hears me assaulting his character when I'm expressing pain and frustration about how his symptoms affect me. And then everything falls apart. I tried to call him because I realized he was filtering my communication in the wrong way that was going to increase his suffering and I wanted to try to help him see his interpretation was wrong before he was in the situation that he felt bad about. Basically some people we know have talked about importance of consistency in child raising, and they are aware that we do not both approach things with consistency. But nobody was judgmental and he assumed they were.  He hung up on me and effectively accused me of having bad intentions in trying to reach him as if my goal was to sabotage him and prove the judging people right as he was scrambling to prove them wrong.   Fuck man how do you keep trying after they accuse yo if the opposite of what you're trying to do. I'm so depressed.
fbb3f54f5621a08ee13ffb68ba0125a7998be2ce2a42d0c815695d1a22dbe0ad;;;Today I am defeated;;;Just needed to vent.   Today was a hard day in a series of hard days. Recently diagnosed hubby is so full of anxiety, rage, and confusion I'm walking on eggshells. Looks, tone, and phrases I don't know are issues seem to be triggering him. I know he has PTSD and RAD to boot, but it's just been hard.   He knows it's an issue. He is apologizing daily for being in a bad mood and is tired of apologizing. I'm telling him he doesn't need to apologize for his mood, just his actions. He's tired and frustrated and just wants to be "normal ". In addition we have to apply for LTD until he is stable on his meds.   Were trying to keep open communication but I feel like he's able to express himself but I'm not. I needed to tell him tonight I understand this is a difficult time for him, but he needs to grant me the same grace. I'm not the one struggling with ADHD but I deal with his fallout, regulating our son, regulating the dog, and if I have any energy left, regulating myself.   I'm just so tired. I'm miss my husband
3c398bc979c9b82d5f5bd1817f7ba4530795464231c6d74e2b8756d698b546b3;;;I shouldn’t have trusted my partner;;;My partner proposed to me last year. I gave them the task of figuring out how to apply for a marriage license. I wanted to get married this month or last and made sure to tell them.  They say that they have it figured out and that we need to go to the county office at some point to apply.  So we go in today and guess what? All applications are online only. I’m baffled. I turn to them and wonder how the hell this happened. They swear up and down that they looked at the whole website and read it closely and that it didn’t mention that at all.   I go onto the website on my phone and first thing I see is the link to apply online. I can’t understand how the heck they didn’t see it. It was right at the front of the webpage. Not to mention that this makes much more sense given the current context of the world (pandemic).  I trusted them. Maybe I was too naive to do so. Maybe I shouldn’t have left this task to them.  So, I took care of it on my phone. It took like 20 min. But now we are going to have to wait 2 months at most. I really wanted to get married this month after a year of waiting and after a total of 6 years of being together.  I’m just so upset and feeling conflicted guys. Is this an omen to not get married? Stuff like this happens all the time and all I get from them is a victim mentality. They go on and say that how useless they are and etc and what am I suppose to do with that? I was the one who was hurt here and now I’m expected to give emotional support????  I am so tired.  Edit: I thought this may be useful context but I gave the task because I’m currently in grad school. They are neither employed or in school.  Edit 2: I found a better way to express myself. I didn’t give them the task like an order it was more of a mental load type thing? Like I mentally checked myself out of looking into how to obtain a marriage license because I was too busy to do so. And I trusted/believed in my partner to do it properly since we had a discussion that they could do it. I hope this explains it better. I don’t assign tasks to my partner haha.

We’ve always been open about things and interested in crazy/weird/unknown phenomena and taboo/occult topics through the years. This past year has been difficult, honestly the past 4 have been since my partner has been a fan of 45 in the 2016 election and most recent 2020 election. He watches so many grifters on YouTube I can’t keep track. I had to ban him listening to Tim Poole in front of me because his videos are so annoying, inaccurate and just outright divisive. I don’t want to bring political debates into this post, I was just wondering if anyone has had their partners special interest be right wing politics/alternative facts. 2020 has been really hellish in our household.
06d1e39bb9cbad6bda578705dec0213e00226bbf3a0af2e2726c1bc5c5df1eda;;;Things my husband used to do that now make complete sense;;;Now this is looking back in the early days of my marriage to my adhd husband, when I still was very much in love and eager to please, and as such crushed daily by the negative attitude and aloofness of my husband...We are now separated, ten years later, and I just thought about these memories as I am slowly going back to myself, my habits and what makes me happy from underneath the heartbreak.  So I have been making pancakes this morning and every Sunday for a few months, to the intense satisfaction of my kids, and it has become a family thing that we are looking forward to. I am so pleased that they want to help me make the dough, cook them, and their faces lit up when we look at this large plate of fragrant golden pancakes. This is a special time. Well just this morning, as I was enjoying it, I remembered that I used to do that when the kids were little, waking up early and cooking up a storm, pancakes, eggs, a nice breakfast on Sunday. My husband and kids loved it... until the day he actually started to make a face and looking disappointed instead of happy. When I asked him why, he said it was nice, but just the same every Sunday... Boring and predictable...( Not that he did anything to suggest something different or take any initiative...) . The fact that it was a predictable, nice thing to look forward to, was actually the whole point for me. I felt hurt and disappointed at his lack of appreciation,and ended up not doing it as often. He had managed to turn a nice, lovingly prepared pancake breakfast on Sunday into something boring and depressing to complain about, and my pleasure of doing it was gone.   Same for the parc that was next to our house. This is easily one of the nicest parks in the place where we lived and many people would come from a distance to spend some time there on the weekends. We lived just across, which was one of the main reasons why we moved there in the first place. We had two young kids who loved it, and we usually went every day on the weekends, for a jog, a walk, to the playground, etc... (it's really big so you don't have to stick to the same area at all).   Well after a few months he just started going "oh no, not... Park, we ALWAYS go there...". Uh, yeah, it's the nicest Park in the region and a two minutes walk? The kids and us love it, or at least used to...? We could go to a different park but we would have to take the car and it would be less nice, more crowded, etc...? Not that he, once again, had something different that he wanted to do or suggest, just the wish to piss all over our simple pleasures and habits and complain, apparently.  Of course it changed things for me, what used to be a nice family activity was now tainted, either I felt like I was forcing him to do something he didn't enjoy, or I had to go by myself with the kids. Also since he was railing against how boring the Parc was, then our oldest started to declare it was boring too, making it harder for me to make the kids go...  So now I understand that his adhd brain was craving novelty and that even pleasant activities he once enjoyed registered as the biggest bore on the planet but as I was making my pancakes this morning with unmitigated pleasure and without his negative outlook, it made me reminiscent of the small, subtle ways in which I had let adhd and this marriage ruin pancakes, then my favorite parc, etc... And ultimately my happiness. And I had no-one to share these thoughts with but you precious people.   Now I am out of this relationship and I am not saying that this is the only way, but please, whatever your situation, don't let your partner's limitations take away your joy. Keep doing what makes you happy, if they want to be sad sacks let them but you don't have to become one. Happy Sunday!

Need advice;;;My (31f) partner (27m) is undiagnosed but I strongly suspect he has it because he has all the symptoms. I think his mother and/or father have it too because they also strongly exhibit symptoms and have normalized them for him.  I’m eating dinner rolls for dinner tonight again because it’s his turn to cook dinner and he’s forgotten and has also forgotten to look at his phone so he hasn’t seen my texts and calls. I’m feeling sick tonight (I’m taking antibiotics) and getting really hungry and annoyed. This happens all the time.  When we first met 2 years ago I thought he just had a lateness problem. I asked him to just let me know when he was running late, it didn’t matter as long as I knew and he struggled to even do that. He’s had the electricity/internet turned off at his place because he forgot to pay the bill. He’s paid his taxes late every year (and I mean late on the extension). His friends have told me they do the thing where they invite him earlier than the actual time so he’ll be on time. And honestly, for the longest time I thought he was just being a dick and selfish. But I started to pay closer attention.  I literally watched him all day once. Watched him want to get started doing things and be thoroughly unable to, and I started looking up symptoms of adhd. We have talked on several occasions about what he thinks his difficulties are (at first I didn’t mention adhd but then I gradually started to bring it up) and he thinks he has a lot of the symptoms. He’s unable to keep his apartment clean, focus at work, pay his bills on time, keep up his end of our mutual responsibilities. It’s frustrating. I am a super punctual person who tries to be efficient and not waste time when I don’t need to.  So why am I still here? Well other than this he’s a fantastic partner. Kind, empathetic, loving, a great listener. He’s the best partner I’ve had. And sometimes for a few days the timeliness and responsiveness gets better, and I get hopeful, but inevitably it goes back to the way it was. We’re just dating and live separately but I worry about our future together. Maybe I’m a dumbass for staying.  I asked my therapist for some names of some therapists specializing in adhd and passed them onto him but he hasn’t done anything yet. He says he doesn’t want to be hounded and badgered. I guess I’m asking - should I just cut my losses and leave? Is it worth continuing to gently nudge him to see a doctor or therapist? I’m just at a loss here.
fb8299ea294cc4227f1e9f511bdc49b0f167c606cb57ac12e0fb6234e176227d;;;Placing Blame (dx);;;My husband and I got into it this morning before I had to leave for work.  He struggles with communication and instead of asking for clarification if he isn't sure he just assumes and carries on with what he's doing.  Of course, this creates problems.  A miscommunication lead to me feeling frustrated and being short with him.  In response he became rude asking "what is your problem this morning" and telling me that I hadn't been nice since I got up.  I let him know that his poor communication is frustrating to deal with and that I wasn't in the mood to deal with his stuff this morning.  I don't remember exactly what happened after, but I feel like he either made excuses or tried to justify what he did because the next thing I remember is me telling him that he sucks at communicating, problem solving etc.  His response to this was to yell at me and told me to "fuck off". We do NOT speak to each other this way, but when I told him that I was not going to tolerate being yelled at or spoken to that way he tried to justify it by saying that I told him that he sucks at communicating and time management.  He then said that I'm the only person in his life who thinks that about him.  He also accused me of gaining satisfaction from accusing him of having terrible communication and organizational/problem solving skills.    I don't understand how he could justify screaming at me and telling me to fuck off by telling me that he was equally offended by my telling him that he's terrible at communicating etc.    I also don't understand how I can be the only person who encounters this issue with him.  He just started a job as a first year teacher and he's doing great.  I think he finally found his place in the world and I'm excited for him.  However, this is the second time that he's brought up how great he's doing at work and how I'm the only person who has an problem with his disorganization and communication.  I've tried to explain that he and I have been battling his ADHD for 12 years (10 undiagnosed). Our relationship isn't comparable to any other and just because his brand new work relationships seem to be perfect we have been through a lot.  I don't know how to make him understand that comparing our relationship to his with other people isn't fair.    It also confuses me that he thinks I get satisfaction from pointing out his flaws.  The only reason I point them out is to bring them to his attention so that he can fix them.  I would LOVE to feel like he can recognize them on his own and fix them but that's not the case.    This sucks because I have a hard time not taking the blame for things but I know I need to stand my ground.  Any advice on how to handle this would be appreciated.
e636991324f0d23e1f8e0fd652355bb001e6a01af9de71f00bc5167c6217827c;;;Losing patience;;;Hey all.   So I my patience is wearing thin with my bf (DX/27) He for all things considered is a fantastic bf. We’ve been quarantining together and he wants me to move in, but he’s so messy that idk if I can deal. He does stuff like cook and leave dishes out for days claiming he’ll get to it later, he lets dishes and clothes pile up in all places...when i try to talk to him about it he blames his ADHD and gets defensive (yes he’s medicated and takes it on schedule) it feels like an excuse if anything and like I’m the one responsible for cleaning constantly. We keep having fights about it and all he can say is “I’ll get better” but he isn’t doing anything to do so. I’ve gotten a White board to write reminders, ive texted them to him, I even did sticky notes all over the places in the apartment he goes to all the time. I don’t know what else to do, but I’m thinking of breaking up with him. I am exhausted trying to take care of him and everything then do my stuff too. It feels like I’m a mom taking care of a kid. Is this normal? Please help.
f0ef87596dfbeffcdcfec2d70a536e2323c9e32c83709cdbfcc1d92b25c4bbb6;;;Forgot to lock car door and we got robbed!;;;Soo.. we arrived in Paris yesterday and this morning checked out this morning to carry on with our journey, packed the car up and then went to get some breakfast to take with us. We were gonna leave the puppy in the car but i decided against as I don't trust paris or anywhere with my dog in the car.   Anyway, got our breakfast and returned to car, it appeared to be messy I couldn't understand and then it hit me I asked my partner (male ADHD) to check for ipad...gone! Wallets, cards, weed ( my partner is not medicated and he uses weed as dopamine boost which I have to say is a godsend and without it he would struggle with moods, tantrums much more)   I'm gutted as my partner never locked the door, he always forgets and I didn't remind him today as I was busy organising the wee puppy when we left the car.   So now I'm im paris with the puppy on my own while he travels all the way back to uk to get some money as we have no cards, also he needs some weed other wise the holiday will be a nightmare with his moods and argumentive behaviour.   I'm kinda just venting and upset because stuff like this happens all the time and its super stressful. I feel really sorry for him too as I know he feels like shite because of it, he really wanted to make our anniversary special he even got me a room lookng out to the eiffel tower and had roses and champagne in the room for me.   I think I'm more empathetic than angry. But it still hard when thing's always go wrong. Imagine we did leave the dog for 5mins, she would have been gone too. However, I think I would of checked if the door was locked if she was in it. Anyway, never leave the dog in a car is probably better.

Usually he is loving, attentive, kind, and *actually cares about how his words might affect someone.*  Anyone else feel like those things get thrown out the window when your ADHD SO goes unmedicated?  Especially what I wrote in my title. If he feels slighted even a little, usually over something so small, then he will say whatever just to hurt the other person and feel like he gains control of the convo.  It hurts and I'm crying and I try to give him space but then sometimes I come back and he is still on whatever it is that is making him so angry. And unless I kneel to the floor and kiss his feet, nothing I can say or do makes him "better."  I HATE unmedicated ADHD in my SO. I probably will get downvoted for saying this.  I just needed to rant/vent.
1c577de525ebf5db6deb7c9e2ff15891f02f890735e7b3b94f5e97b1a71471b9;;;I, non-ADHD spouse, am really, really, reallllly struggling with my DX ADHD spouse and my marriage;;;Update: My husband and I had an amazing counselor. He began seeing her on his own to work on some of his stuff. He also saw a doctor that prescribed in Wellbutrin and Lexapro and it is the magical prescription cocktail he (and I) needed. He is upset he didn't get on medication sooner. My marriage was saved because of his willingness to get help and be on meds. I appreciate everyone's input. My husband and I got through that really rough patch and are stronger for it.  \---------  I am really struggling in my marriage. I share a lot camaraderie with others on here, and know this is a safe place to share experiences. I'm going to sum this up as best I can, so here it goes.  I have resentment. I have anger. I have sadness. And I have a lot of anxiety (recently put on anxiety meds). My dx ADHD husband became unemployed two weeks before we got married, which was in October 2018. He found part-time work in May/June of 2019 and became unemployed again due to the pandemic. He refused to take unemployment both times he became unemployed and I basically had to beg him and seek an employment attorney's advice so he would file for unemployment. I am self-employed and my business started to boom right around the time he became unemployed in late 2018. Of course this was good timing, but I effectively became the breadwinner (which I hate being) and it was the first time in my life where I could enjoy the money I made (I didn't make much starting out in business for myself at first), but this feeling of enjoying the money I make is kind of squashed with my unemployed husband and our bills. There is also an incredible imbalance because of this in our marriage. I am buried in work while he can play hours of video games each day (resentment). I forgot to mention that he would NOT discuss his unemployment and how it affected us, he'd refuse to talk about it and get short with me. I would acknowledge how difficult it must be for him and ask how I could help, yet he could not acknowledge the toll it took on me.  I do want to say my husband is trying, and I know he's trying in lots of ways (I do tell him this). But what I've come to realize is that while he had a good (ish) handle on his ADHD for him personally, yet it's affecting our marriage as we are a unit together now and I don't think he's considering how his ADHD affects our marriage. I find him to be selfish (I can list reasons), I find him dismissive of me and my needs (I can list reasons), he can have anger issues, not that I've ever felt unsafe physically, but I've certainly and often feel unsafe emotionally. This evening he asked what was on my mind. I shared, and he got defensive, basically told me I didn't remember correctly, I challenged him, and he became silent. I asked if he wanted to talk about what I brought up and he said "no" and shortly walked away and proceeded to get on a call with friends and laugh and act like everything is fine while I'm upstairs balling my eyes out feeling so unheard, so unseen, and frankly miserable in my marriage right now. I know the kind thing to do is be direct and I try, often (just like I did tonight), but am often dismissed and invalidated.  The good news is we are in counselling together and I am very grateful for that. We do not have kids, but I am terrified to have kids with him (these terrified feelings came after we were married seeing different sides to him: I'm nervous about his anger, I'm nervous about me having to be even more responsible in our relationship than I am now (I've tried to avoid the parent-child dynamic, but definitely feel it come out somewhat often, and I'm terrified that will only magnify when we become parents).  Long story short, I feel lonely. I am becoming distant to my husband. I am on anxiety medication. I am sleeping in a different room (the last few days and am crying myself to sleep each night). Our sex life is really dwindling. I think he is in denial about how we are as a couple even though I tell him I am really struggling.  Any advice (good/bad/in-between), and even encouragement would be awesome.  TLDR; I have anger, resentment and lots of anxiety in my marriage with my dx ADHD spouse. I am becoming distant out of resentment, I'm on anxiety medication, I sleep in a different room and am crying myself to sleep often, our sex life is dwindling and I think my husband is in denial even though I tell him I'm really, really struggling. We are in counseling together though.

That I should know he didn't mean it that way. He can't focus. That he's frustrated. Sure.  So that gives you the right to be a complete jackass?   Tell me to shut up and fucking listen. Tell our son quit crying after you made him feel stupid.  I'm fucking exhausted!   If I acted this way I'd have an ear full but he has ADHD so everything is to just be swept under the rug and get over it.  Telling an adult they need to adult is impossible.
3e9c50bae701579df14ba3e61c70776ddbac074fe94d46e24509d0be4660f4e0;;;I need an honest opinion: Am I "making this a big deal"?;;;This is how it went down: As I'm waking up, He's (37, DX, meds when he remembers) almost done getting dressed, obviously leaving. I asked where he's going, since I need my car to run a few errands. He said he's going to his friends real quick to grab something and he'd be right back. "I'm not going anywhere else, I'm not picking anyone up, I'm going there and coming right back" he reassures me when I start to object, because I know his "be right backs" are longer than the average person.  The trip, if he's really just going and coming right back, should take 20 minutes, maybe 30 if he hits every light and there's traffic. He pulls up around the 45 minutes mark. He comes in and says "I think I got my drone sold!" I asked who to. He said his friends name. I said "you have to go all the way back over there?" To which he replies "I haven't even gone over there yet!"  Well what have you been doing for 45 minutes?? "I went and picked up other friend, He's gonna go with me." I then start to go off. That's literally exactly what he promised he wasnt going to do. "What's the big deal?!" He yells. The big deal is that you tell me one thing and do the exact opposite, all the fucking time. "Plans change" is what he says, every fucking time.  "I can't believe you don't think this isn't a big deal, that I cannot trust what you tell me" I yelled. "Its not a big deal, you're making it a big deal!!" Is his response. Please be honest, am I overreacting? When do "plans change" and "saying what I need to say to get the car and get outta the house" become clear? I don't know which it is. Am I just being a stickler here? It happens so often, him doing what he says he won't and chalking it up to "changed plans last second". Anyone have anything similar happen? Ugh   It ends with him pissed that I can't adapt to plans changing, that I'm not "go with the flow." Please be honest. You won't hurt my feelings. I have to have someone else's opinion!

But I’m just wondering what are you not allowed to do or have to ease up on. I’m just trying to post something lighter for once.

9b1a8a86f7d031e3c55299852fb403edcb53d9a6f9c338920854add5b9685651;;;RSD rages;;;How do you cope with RSD rages? It is a real barrier to the normal give and take of conflict resolution. My partner stonewalls or lashes out, and hears any negative feedback as a character assassination. I tell him that his anger is scary, and I worry he could lose control and strike me, and he gets mad at me for thinking of him that way because he has never done it. He becomes more concerned with protecting his image of himself than with the feedback he is getting. Now, I'm not even sure that's an ADHD thing (the narcissism in that), but I do know RSD is a factor in this more generally.   I am trying to get through to him that he has to get the anger under control. I don't know how to do that in a way that doesn't just feed his avoidant coping style. If I walk away whenever he's lashing out at me, it rewards the behavior with the exact thing he wants. He wants to shut down the conversation. I cannot negotiate for any changes effectively much less have a calm discussion to find a compromise for areas of distress or disagreement because he is not managing his emotions well enough to accomplish that. And somehow he behaves like it's my fault he's mad, when he's responsible for learning the skills to stay calm and present despite RSD making him hear things that I am not saying.   We have been working hard on our marriage but this is an area that continues to cause a lot of problems. Any ideas?
c76a43389be1d003f0de934ba0ab4fad79402b48eb417e938b23ab35c42b7556;;;Feeling frustrated today, like I'm carrying all the weight;;;My husband has grasped his ADD, he gets it. He is medicated and understands how his ADD affects our lives.  However.  He's been out of work since March, laid off right before lockdown. I work full time from home and do well so we've been fine financially, but his unemployment runs out very soon (and our state hasn't made a payment to him in two weeks without notice or reason, but he won't get on the phone about it because he says has to sit on hold for hours). I helped him revamp his resume and he has an interview soon, but the kitchen is a MESS (his turf), the garbage cans are tipped over and still sitting in the alley after being put out there on Tuesday, and he's currently asleep with our dogs while I'm in front of my computer for work. Whenever I stick my head in his office, on his computer screen is hobby stuff, not a job search. He knows the house is his to manage while I work but I still have to make lists of what needs to be done even though it should be obvious. If I make a list and point it out he'll do it, but he'll do only 80% of it.  I've told him before that I feel taken advantage of, since I'm bringing in a good paycheck we can live on, and he says he understands but here we are. I know that in his mind, he thinks having an interview means he doesn't have to keep looking for work so he's free to slack. It's so frustrating and I've been very gentle and nice because he hurts easily but my patience is wearing so thin. I don't want to parent him, he's an adult and should know he needs to get up and do stuff, but apparently he doesn't. I don't know how else I can say it or what else I can say, I'm getting near the end of my rope before I snap at him.

We just purchased a house, moved, and helped myom move in with us.  As you can expect, this has triggered a lot of her OCD issues.  No matter what I do, I can't unpack and organize correctly. For those familiar with OCD, it is typically treated with exposure therapy. That is a process that is anxiety and panic attack inducing at it easiest. I feel like everything I do is an exposure therapy to my wife. She had a melt down in the car in the Chipotle parking lot tonight and she kept trying to pin the issue on me.  Help.  I can't find any resources on both OCD and ADHD. I can find one or the other, but nothing relating to the pairing. Help me please.  Right now, everything I do is resulting in break downs, panic attacks, and fights, and she always trust to pin it back on me.  I feel like an abused spouse that is being told that I wouldn't get hit so much if I didn't act this way. (I'm not being physically abused)  I feel broken.
9b1a8a86f7d031e3c55299852fb403edcb53d9a6f9c338920854add5b9685651;;;Everything is last minute;;;I am irritated and stressed because my husband never plans anything in advance and if he tries, he loses track of time and then doesn't keep the commitment. Last night he asked if I wanted to hang out and watch a show when I was done with my bath. I should have said no, but I have also complained that he doesn't initiate shared activities so I was trying to be cooperative. I cut my bath short because I knew it was late enough that there wasn't time for the relaxing bath I wanted and time to watch something before I get sleepy. I'm a morning person and work at 7am. I can't stay up til 2 like he does. He knows this. But of course he lives on last minute everything. I got out of the bath and he said he had to go do something before we could watch the show. I got so angry. Why ask me to do something if you aren't ready to do it. I cut my own self care short and he wasn't done piddling around.   Is this really just ADHD and I have to deal with it? He says this is just how his brain works and he can't fix it. I think maybe he could learn to check the time before suggesting something and say "I know it's kind of late for you but..." To just show some tiny awareness of other people's needs. Is that really too much to ask?
e8e04b68672d27eda1e6d28434f54b8ab70e1b06a9162e38018d08d7a532af12;;;Does it get better?;;;My husband’s (30M-DX) ADHD imploded our marriage. It took him losing his job, failing out of college, and our separation/impending divorce for him to finally realize that he needs to treat his ADHD.   He was diagnosed initially as a child, but comes from a narc family and his parents refused to let him be treated. We both have a lot of anger towards his parents as he is incredibly intelligent and his life now would be so different if they had just started treatment for him as a child.   He is finally on medication. We’ve struggled to get him consistent therapy-he doesn’t have a therapist right now and is sometimes resistant to the idea. Any help in getting him to see that consistent therapy is crucial?   Likewise, his ADHD created major anger and resentments in me for the years of our relationship where I had to nag him to do anything at all. I have always felt very lonely in our marriage. He ruined his credit, forgot to pay bills, wracked up debts and has collections out, etc.   He is trying, but I still do the majority of the emotional and mental labor in our relationship. I’m tired, really, really tired. Coupled with other issues in our relationship, I’m ready to throw in the towel. I guess I’m asking if it’s even possible for him to improve? Can he get to a point where he can function as an independent adult? I can’t do this for the rest of my life.

After being diagnosed at 30, I realized a lot of what caused problems was not just immaturity but ADHD symptoms. It’s a year later and I’m still really struggling to accept what it means for our lives. For better or worse right? It’s not his fault. But I didn’t know that this is what it would be like. And not to mention the YEARS of misunderstanding that led to loads of resentment. It’s done a lot of damage. How can I get over the expectations I had of my marriage and move forward? Edit: he won’t go to therapy
913be67a7d9adc527abc54454a72429bdb7fde307da24e25ae3fa299093e580c;;;Is item blindness a thing?;;;I think my husband is blind to "his" stuff and overly aware of mine.   When we first moved in together he'd go on regular rants on how much "stuff" I had. That everywhere he'd look was my things. Granted, I brought in a lot more furniture and kitchen items into the relationship, but beyond that I didn't see an overabundance of my things in the space. I reduced what I did have or and got rid of some of the unneeded items since it seemed to bother him so much. I regret some of the items I've tossed, but he still seems to think I have too much stuff and need to get rid of it.    He's also had moments where he's been frustrated with me leaving (in his words) trash everywhere that he needs to clean up, junk just sitting out in his way, etc. I've been trying to be really conscious of this and making sure I put items in their home when I'm done with it. I constantly feel like I'm just a slob and a horrible housekeeper because I can't seem to keep it clean enough for him.   Well, with the pandemic I'm off work so I decided to do some deep spring cleaning. What I've discovered: our kitchen table is unusable because it's COVERED in his things. 100% of the items on there are his. He has a tendency to hoard paper towels and napkins and leave them everywhere. I picked up 6 so far today. He has over 8 pairs of headphones. He has a pile of "future projects" just sitting in the office space that have no home. Everywhere I look is piles and piles of papers, electronics, project bits, etc etc. But he doesn't see any of it. He just sees my stuff, my messes.   Is this an ADHD thing? Any tips on how to approach this?

ed2222eb96cb34c827c4eb577d8e0ec58dd27049c505c40b322349eb1ad32f68;;;Boundaries;;;So I’m on the part in The ADHD Effect on Marriage about boundaries and I’m curious, what boundaries have you and your ADHD spouse set? We discussed always showing respect, even when we’re upset and using the phrase “can you rephrase that?” when we feel like the other isn’t saying something respectful. And then my personal boundary is to ask “do you want advice or for me to just listen” because it’s in my nature to jump in and help out even when it’s not asked (co dependent family traits yay). I’m also toying with some wording of my happiness depends upon me but not sure how to phrase it. Basically I’m trying to work myself back to a person I like and can be proud of again (see previous post about being my old self)   TL;DR What boundaries hace you guys set together and/or separately
ed2222eb96cb34c827c4eb577d8e0ec58dd27049c505c40b322349eb1ad32f68;;;Appreciation;;;Me- F31 NT (though I question that) SO- NDX I just want to express how happy I am I found you all. I’ve cried multiple times reading different posts and comments because I finally feel seen. It’s hard explaining this to those outside the situation w out them judging him harshly. But here....I finally don’t feel crazy! I don’t feel like I’m some evil biznotch trying to make him feel like the worse person ever. For years he’s said my depression isn’t his fault. But I wasn’t this depressed before marriage. My anxiety wasn’t this bad. I wasn’t so flinchy. I never screamed at anyone. I’ve change so much in efforts to protect my own ego from when he verbally lashes out because he feels threatened. It’s a bitter sweet feeling because things could have been so much different if we had all this information 10 years ago. Honestly 50 years ago! I been sharing some of the resources I’m finding here with my mom and she’s like wow....this woulda saved so much heartache. Once she hit menopause, she almost left so he finally got medicated (not for the ADHD, but anxiety and depression, didn’t want to pay to get full work up dx 🙄). Then I turned around and married my dad 😅 But hopefully now, it’s know better do better. I keep trying to react less and be proactive. Hopefully I can convince him to get help. I emailed him that lovely blog post about adhd and married men in denial. Just gotta work up the courage to tell him I sent him an email cuz the last two weekends there have been fights and I’m not in the mood for another.

I’m looking for some advice/support/insight on how to deal with my partner who has adhd, shutting down post conflict.   The other night he made a comment that was minor, but it upset me a little and it made me feel disrespected. I had sent him some job information (I thought I was being helpful) a week ago, and then the other night it got brought up again and he told me “almost every time you send me stuff like that it almost never helps me whatsoever”  He said after I asked, that he understands I was just trying to be helpful, and he gave me a half as apology but I accepted it anyways. I then was super cool and ok, I had in my mind squashed everything and was ready to return to normalcy. Reassured him that I’m not mad at him, hug and kiss and whatnot.   He then shuts down, goes to the bedroom lays in the dark and silence, spiralling negative thoughts about himself, bc he felt bad for what he did. This lasts for a couple hours. (Sometimes until the next morning!) I checked on him periodically, but he was so unresponsive, there was no getting him out of the funk. No matter what I try to do, doesn’t work. I ask him what he needs, he doesn’t know. Nothing.   I’m also a very anxious person, I especially have difficulty with taking on others emotions, trying to fix everything, etc. So seeing him like that though breaks my heart, and I have no idea how to help him or what to do in those situations. And it in turn makes me feel really really bad that I brought it up.   Am I being manipulated? Because it sometimes feels like maybe I am being punished for bringing it up, because he knows that I’m now feeling awful, In lieu of him feeling awful...   Thanks in advance, I appreciate any advice or support you’re willing to give ♥️
661087e5cc34555abfc9c392cca1a8fca175779a682d0a1ac24d3d7039672d75;;;Advice needed - communication;;;My wife (diagnosed within the last couple of years and medicated) continually tells me she HATES how distant I am and it's hurtful. She keeps telling me that she wants me to tell her about my feelings. Then I try to tell her about my pain, and about the damage her constant emotional swings and intense outbursts do.  I tell her about how hurt, and ignored I've felt for 14 years now. I try to tell her that just because I'm NT, it doesn't mean I've got it all figured out, and I'm processing through what her diagnosis means at the same time she is, just in a different way.  I tell her about the types of hurtfully things she says, and then be tell her how she could say them differently to get her point across without being hurtful. I tell her I'm just looking for her to acknowledge how I feel without trying to explain it away or invalidate it.  EVERY TIME I have tried explaining my feelings she gets defensive, tries to explain why what I feel isn't accurate because she wasn't trying to hurt me, and then tells me she's confused, because what I say doesn't make sense.    I'm a teacher and a communicator for a living. Why is it that my spouse is the one person who can't ever understand what I'm saying?  Am I not as good at communicating as I thought?  Is she incapable of actually understanding my view point?  Is this a lost cause?  It sure feels like it.
c56e0a05ac726b68252053627bccc1aa9f087737e356a41f569922dd646ae172;;;Are productive conversations possible? How do you return to communication gone terribly awry?;;;Mainly our relationship consists of me being the “This is fine” dog meme in a fiery room until I feel the need to open a conversation about something that feels unlivable. In between all of these conversations, my partner vows he will check in more, communicate more, and altogether take the wheel more about aspects of our relationship that are unsatisfying for me because undoubtedly if I take the initiative to speak with him, he gets annoyed and defensive so therefore he needs to communicate more when he feels he has the patience.  Only he forgets. Totally. And then inevitably I start a conversation over an issue that is totally worth discussing.   Even if it’s been months since our last relationship-centric conversation, my partner still has an extraordinarily finite amount of patience. His finite amount of patience sets me off precisely because I’ve been curating an easygoing environment for months and I feel I deserve attention and it goes south from there.  We had a bunch of fights in the last week and ultimately I set a variety of expectations calmly outside of our arguments : that I either expect my partner to incite conversations when he knows he has patience to have one OR I expect him to postpone conversations I start to a time when he will have empathy and patience. I also said that the primary purpose of these conversations, given that he makes it painfully clear that only I care about their existence & content, is to solve problems, listen to me, and offer reassurance because the burdens of the relationship fall so much on my shoulders and I need to touch base sometimes and feel it’s worth it. He said he understood and agreed with me.  We began talking tonight and he said the exact fucking wrong things. As in things that I’ve specifically asked that he stop saying, in essence “if you feel that way, maybe we shouldn’t be together” and also “I’m doing everything I can so if it’s still not enough, I don’t know what to tell you.” The second comment is deeply infuriating because it took years to get him to see an effective therapist and do a handful of chores so he’s really not doing everything but barely reaching a bare minimum which I’m supposed to respect because it’s hard for him.  These comments are just him being fucking stupid and tactless. He doesn’t actually seem to feel this way and desperately does not want to break up. Which I know because I am still open to doing so after years together and he aggressively resists doing so when it comes up. I can logically see that but they feel like a fucking dealbreaker when I have to put on a brave face for months and then he chooses when I start to crumble to be a stupid, thoughtless prick.  I criticized his response and then he gets fucking fiery because he was “trying to help” and he just tries to flip it on me for being under-appreciative. If I say comments like this actually make me want to break up, he tries to use that as proof that communication = bad or gets frustrated and belittles the situation like it’s stupid or I’m being stupid and we could just be happy if I was more zen. But I feel so convinced that these issues are a direct product of ignoring problems and then being nothing but an ass when they’re discussed. And then I get lectured on figuring out what I want or letting negative comments pass through me more or seeing that he’s trying to help, even when it seems like he’s doing everything in his power to make things worse.  I don’t think it’s intentional but obviously it makes me not want to talk to him at all. Which I think he sees as a win, like hooray no talking but I see it as I will find somebody who I can talk to.  I don’t even feel like it’s about being right so much as it’s about being a team. I have always had to carry the team far more and the moments when I start to buckle are the moments I need him to show up, not the time to be the most undeserving martyr of all time. I know that avoiding conversation, then handling eventual conversations poorly and feeling persecuted is the exact formula for ensuring I will want to leave.  Is this normal? Have others had similar experiences?   I don’t even embark on these conversations intending to discuss a break up. I just feel like I could be ten percent happier with a little effort or reassurance and then I leave them feeling like yeah upending my whole life would be easier than continuing to endure this person.  Can somebody offer me advice for the mature next step? We ended on a note of him telling me listening gets him nowhere, me replying that he obviously isn’t listening to me and then him eventually shouting “Enough!” and storming off.  I feel like crying and shouting and being emotional but honestly I just want to return to it and communicate that if he wants to lose this, then that’s fine by me. That communication is just supposed to ensure we stay together.   I cried for a while but now I just feel numb. And I guess I’d like a little guidance on if this is all normal, worth it, and what’s the most mature way to feel or act next. I know feelings don’t have to be mature, but I feel like I’m crumbling and I’d appreciate guidance.  TL; DR: ADHD partner ensures communication is toxic and then refuses future communication because it only ever goes poorly

I just can't feel empathetic for my partner when they struggle with executive dysfunction, time blindness and hyperfixations because I also experience those things but manage them effectively, completely unmedicated. I have ASD and PTSD, which causes lots of ADHD symptoms, but I damn well manage because as a woman, I've never had a choice, I've always had to manage, long before I was diagnosed!!  On that note, how in the hell am I supposed to navigate their want for spontaneity and lack of routine with my NEED for structure and routine? Part of managing my mental health so well is structure and routine and when we're together, they just leave me in limbo, never knowing what's going on until it's already happening. They can't even plan a simple dinner without getting lost scrolling through their phone and I'm not able to cope with this. My mental health is suffering when I'm around them.  The funny thing is, I've heard structure is great for ADHD folks so why do they insist that their way is better, that living in chaos is functional when it's clearly not?? I've tried to talk to them about this but I don't think any of it is going in, I don't think they care enough to TRY to introduce structure. It seems like any coping skills I suggest that have helped me with these symptoms they experience, all the help I try to give either doesn't go in, or they try once and then give up when it's not easy. Please, I'm going to lose my Shit.
c4e81644445fad999ee9889c0e0ab0c12f0d0fab33b1f60d9173f2c0c9e69ecd;;;He’s finally getting the help he needs, but our relationship isn’t;;;He (Dx ADHD) is finally in a place where he has a team of people - a psychotherapist, an ADHD coach, and a behavioral psychiatrist specializing in adult ADHD - working with him. His parents are also now finally seeing how his ADHD affects his day-to-day life and trying to be supportive.   I’m so happy he has these people focused on his success now, but this comes after almost four years of me taking on most of these roles by myself and begging him to get help (for months he even lied to me and said he was going to therapy when he wasn’t).  For years he would hide his symptoms along with his anxiety and depression from everyone except me who often was on the receiving end of it all. This was especially true during times he was unemployed (he’s been laid off three times in the last year).   I endured so much abuse and gaslighting just trying to make him reflective of his own behavior and introduce accountability with no success, but now that people with advanced degrees are doing the same he is so receptive and calls them all geniuses. He has this whole team that he is crediting with his recent success, but he doesn’t see me as part of it. When I try to hold him accountable at home, I become the enemy. I’m either “pushing him too hard” or I just “don’t understand him”.   I’m so glad he’s getting the help he needs, but there’s still so much hurt from the past. I know he hates reflecting on the past, so even though he’s doing a bunch to work on himself and his own self compassion, I don’t feel like I’ll ever get the recognition or overdue apologies I deserve. I also don’t know how much more patience I have to be in an unfulfilling relationship while he “works on himself”. Wondering if we both wouldn’t just benefit from starting fresh with other people.
0a72b2605a15c965da21946d61fe7e9fa3f0f40983a264629997ec32e3d227d1;;;Partner is FREAKING OUT at 6am because I used 3 more bowls than what he’s “allotted” as our use of daily dishes...;;;We’re a couple, no kids and we live in a small apartment. We don’t have a whole ton of stuff and when it comes to the kitchen, when we first moved out, we started on a simple camping kitchen type of setup. Basic utensils and what not. Living together has had its ups and downs and over the last 3 years or so my UDX partner has had this thing for minimalism. I enjoy it to a point.   I say that because as much as I agree that “less is more” and being more sustainable and frugal and less wasteful, that mindset of just getting things rid of everything isn’t always the greatest when it comes to living with another person who also uses said items. Which brings me to the problem we’ve been having.   My partner took away HALF of our dishes, utensils, cups because he said he was sick of doing the dishes. Now we don’t have an excess amount of dishes and utensils, legit we have a set of 4 of each utensils, 10 plates with 4 large, 2 medium and 4 small dessert dishes as well as 5 bowls. As for cups we have like 6 mugs and a few mason jars that double as drink cups or storage. We have no dish washer so we have to wash everything by hand. My partner started FLIPPING OUT slamming doors and yelling at me right before my alarm woke me to describe how displeased and disrespected he felt for me having used 3 bowls. 3 bowls that he “hid” up on the very top shelf, but claims he isn’t hiding them even tho I’m short af and can’t see/reach them on the top unless I’m on a stool.  We have had issues with the dishes early on since living together. I used to do literally all cleaning when we first moved in and boy did I realize that was wrong. I got so overwhelmed through the first year that I started to resent him and not do any chores. I resented him because he said he would help and then wouldn’t or when he did he made a huge deal about it and it was more unpleasant dealing with that. Plus he half ass cleans so the kitchen and things were never really “clean” by normal standards of clean. I can say that I hate doing the dishes too since it’s my least favorite chore, but there been many many many times in the past and current when he says he’ll do the dishes on his night/day to do em and then he lets them sit for days on end. I have also been guilty of this before in the past and present but only 2 days at most and  not for like 3/4 days or almost an entire week at a time like he does. I enjoy cooking food and eating at home rather than spending loads on delivery fees for 1 meal.   I don’t think we need to have a problem with the amount of dishes we have if we simply rinsed and washed them as we use them. I have tried to communicate this and he always says yeah but then doesn’t do it. That’s my solution. His solution for when he does the dishes is to just get rid of dishes, out of sight out of mind and it’s like we’re living with the bare minimum of utensils, bowls and plates but still eat the same amounts of food. He told me that it would help him with doing the dishes by having less. I happen to disagree because the sinks just fills up like it used to anyways and when it comes to him and doing the dishes, he ALWAYS half finishes doing them, whether or not we used more dishes or less, the sink still filled up because we’re humans and we eat. I usually end up finishing his job because he doesn’t wash the utensils or cups or anything that he deems “too dirty” so he just leaves it there for me to deal with or if I don’t he then has to and has a a fit about it, despite it also being something messy he has cooked at times. I even told him if you don’t want to do a sink full of dishes everyday then just wash as you go? Idk seems like an easy thing to try.  I’m sitting outside with the dog now because I can’t go back to sleep and my heart is pounding with anxiety because I got woken up by slamming cabinets and dishes in the sink because it was half full and I used 3 “extra” bowls that were up higher. Oh I should also mention that he’s hidden the dishes and utensils from me before without communication about that’s what he’s doing NUMEROUS TIMES and yet we still have the same problems surrounding the dishes. This has been an ongoing problem for about 4 years now and I’m so fucking over it. So he’s yelling at me super loud and slamming things for 10 minutes or so this morning and I’m just laying in bed with my blanket over my head and I could start to feel the dog shake and he moved between my legs because he was scared. Then I told him to not do the dishes if it was making him so upset and he told me to STFU. Minutes later he goes to the bathroom and it’s nice and peaceful but the damage is already done. I’m awake and anxious and annoyed now because you’re so deeply bothered by 3 bowls...so I then tell him that if he wants to express his anger and frustrations then don’t do it before 6 am or wait until when I wake up because that’s disrespectful to me. He then doubled down on how disrespected he felt for me having used more dishes than what he left to use.   Is he being unreasonable as I suspect over the dishes? I feel like he’s being so controlling about it and it’s really annoying. I fucking hate feeling so anxious now and now this is gonna be a struggle for me today to get back into the zone. Anytime he wakes me up screaming and yelling and slamming stuff it makes me anxious and it’s an anxiety that sticks with me all day and makes it really hard for me to do other activities because I feel so stressed out cortisol wise that I can’t think to do other things until my nervous system relaxes. I have trauma from seeing my dad do similar things with my mom (throwing things, slamming doors, breaking things and yelling/screaming over small/dumb things that don’t have warrant that type of anger). Whenever he acts like this I feel like a child again and I hate it. I have also told him that it triggers me and makes me feel unsafe, scared and anxious and yet he still behaves this way.  No surprise since he’s unmedicated but I mean can medication and CBT therapy even help with that for him so he realizes that he’s causing me pain for reacting so explosive?   Any thoughts on what to do because I’m sad, anxious and am starting to feel like I’m wasting time here again because I feel like shit and everything is still the same. I’m the one who has to be the adult to do pretty much everything because he can’t or won’t. He can take care of himself and pay some bills when he remembers them and feeds himself a child’s/bachelors style of cooking/eating if it were up to him and it’s cereal, meat, ice cream, cookies, sandwiches and ramen sometimes. If there’s a real meal to be had it’s usually me cooking it, looking up a recipe and or prepping it. I’m depressed and tired and I don’t know what to do.

What even truly works?;;;(That is a rhetorical question...mostly and this is mostly half a rant/half an invitation for advices if anyone has any idea I guess, if we knew we all wouldn’t be here having these problems after all)  edited to add a few words to make things clearer!  TL;DR long term relationship, communication never go anywhere anymore, not at the end of my road or anything, just plain frustrated and want better for both of us. I’ve read and tried to apply a lot of the tips suggested on this sub and advice for ADHD in general in vain for the most part.  For additional context , I am 30M with 26F (NDX) partner.  Gather round ADHD partner folks, I am sure all of us have by now a dozen of ADHD help books under our belts.   We know negative reinforcement don’t quite work, tough conversations are often too overwhelming for our partners and sure I could just love them through it all but that would not make me any different from an enabler now does it ?   I am aware of the guilt and potential shame preventing those who suffer from truly coming to terms with their issues but unless it is faced head on it is only going to cause more problem down the line.  Kicker is, when you DO manage to thrash out an issue and get your point across somewhat , I feel like a tyrant forcing someone with a broken leg to run a marathon. All I need from my partner is an acknowledgement of the issue, get us on the same page to go towards the solution together. Instead I get days or even weeks of self loathing from her and I’m left feeling like I should have walked on eggshells and not brought up the issue after all.   On managing it, I try to suggest solutions and I get that they don’t all work and me just saying “try this” gets frustrating but I hear things like “I try so hard and get frustrated I can’t because of my disability why isn’t that enough for you?” from her and it frustrates me because in my opinion it was never about (just) me ? Clearly it isn’t enough FOR HER as well if she’s living unhappily .   Last but not least I am sick and tired of hearing any variations of “I don’t want to be a burden/ I am sorry for being a burden”.  First of all, strictly speaking a lot of it are , some I’m happy to help, some I do begrudgingly but whatever, it is what it is, might as well make the most of it. I don’t care for sorrys, I would love some gratitude for a change (and I have brought this up but it worked for a day top) Any idea asides from perhaps saying “I would prefer you thank me instead” days on end which just sounds self-absorbed.  To end of on a somewhat cheerier note, for most parts we don’t have big ‘issues’? Just bubbling resentments from my part for always being ready to help and do things and take the initiatives but still get brushed off for not being supportive enough/sensitive the right way . Just thinking out loud and would appreciate others chiming in.  Apologies for the wall of text and thank you if you’ve made it to the end. Hang in there too.

I don't know how to work around this increasingly difficult obstacle. I will say something to my partner (no treatment) and it most always becomes an argument.   I ask to have what I said repeated to make sure we're in the same page & I have yet to have it repeated back accurately. They will insert assumptions on what I am thinking, how I am feeling, and what I am doing that's often a 180 from the original statement.   If I attempt to correct it I am met with one of two things. Either they will openly separate themself from the conversation (physically or mentally) with no intention of approaching it later on *or* I never get a chance to correct it because every word out of my mouth is drowned out by their defensively repeating the same misinformation I heard from them the first time.   I don't see any way around this so if anyone has tried something that has worked for them I'd be interested to hear it.
f1117bd96b32e3ae2e45d2596eccdeeb55a797b677baa8605a9c670ae326a684;;;Hyperfocus Question;;;My partner (NDX) has typical ADHD inattentive qualities. It drives me nuts-typical issues of feeling neglected, etc. I’ve stopped trying to compete with whatever hobby he’s focusing on. I just don’t waste my time anymore. Here’s my question. I’ve watched countless videos, listened to numerous podcasts and read tons of text trying to figure out the wiring of a ADHD affected brain. The advice is to not take it personally, that it can’t be helped, that they just can’t focus on what doesn’t interest them and that’s that.   So if they are tuning you out, how are you not supposed to take that personally?  🤔

I've had a rough couple of years  (burnout at my PhD, chronic migraines, PhD supervisor passing away, mom diagnosed with cancer, ...) and am going to therapy. It is very difficult for my bf to listen to me. He can often make me feel like I'm nagging on about things, taking too much "space" and leaving no spacefor him. For example, one time I had a bad day at work and he promised I could talk about it in the car to my moms. Halfway through my story without having given any other reaction to anything I said, he asked whether it was "his turn" to talk about his day. I was already pretty emotional and was aobviously offended. He then responded with "okay, I can see you have no space for me", making me feel bad as if I'd been selfish and nagging him the whole time. Most of the time when I'm talking, he will not respond, and he will be busy doing other things. Whenever I question whether he's listening, he'll just repeat what I said without giving any other kind of response. This makes me feel incredibly alone with the issues I'm dealing with. Ironically, one of the issues I'm dealing with in therapy is that I feel the people in my environment don't really care about me, so the way he's acting really hits home.  On top of that, he doesn't seem to want to spend time with me. He likes to be by himself and spends a lot of his time gaming. I like to keep busy. Most of the things I like to do, he doesn't want to do. I feel like I have to do most of the things I truly want to do by myself. If I am able to convince him to spend time together, more than one thing per weekend is "too much". When I confront him, he mostly says things like "we went for a walk last week". I'm tired of having to beg for his attention and always feeling like the needy one, while he doesn't seem to care whether he sees me or not.  The last two weeks have been particularly difficult. I'm starting trauma therapy, which also means talking about the traumatic events (and thinking about them between sessions). My therapist said to "warn" my boyfriend that I could get emotional. His response was "so the same as always then". I kind of gave up trying to talk to him, since every time I tried his response was quite hurtful. When I confront him with how I've been feeling, his response is that I'm also not talking about it (while I feel that when I try, he just doesn't want to here it). At the same time, he's been deep into the release of a new game. He might come down to watch TV with me once a night, but only if I'm not watching anything yet (and ofcourse he doesn't want to talk when we're watching TV).  Does this sound familiar to anyone? How do you cope?
c9baecf611aaa6730c44e21820eb4684b57a316000093e7e2d085ac5ba816c5b;;;Announcement;;;I see a lot of frustrations floating around in the form of vent-posts, and they are most likely justified. Some of you are familiar here and have stated in the past why their frustrations are related to ADHD, so they don't need to re-introduce their circumstances everytime. However, I have noticed this tendency has been picked up by newcomers that leave us  guessing the relevance of their concerns to this ADHD focused subreddit.  Therefore the rules section will have an addition:  **I will ask you to make a brief statement in the beginning of your post wether your S.O./friend/relative has been diagnosed or not, just written as DX or NDX will do just fine.**  In addition, we'll soon be rolling out a weekly vent-thread where you can write off your frustrations. This will be tested for a few weeks, with the intent to make room for a more constructive debate regarding our loved ones.  &#x200B;  Edit: As a counterpart, we feel there's a need for a **Weekly Victory thread** aswell, where you can share your successes small or big. These will be rolled out somewhere this week, so stay tuned!

I always check my surroundings everywhere I go”. Yes that’s true, it’s a good idea and I am working on this. But then why is it so hard to check your surroundings and put things away after using them?     Leaving stuff on the floor in the hallway, leaving random flammable things on top of the stove (such as dishcloths) or inside the oven (plastic bowls), or just straight up leaving elements on, leaving laptops on chairs and blankets where I’m likely to sit. Leaving shoes right in the doorway. If I wanted to trip over things all day I would have got a cat. And every time I knock something over with my feet that he left, he acknowledges he needs to do better for 2 seconds before lecturing me on  how I need to watch my surroundings. Yes I agree checking my surroundings is good practice, but I can’t anticipate every thing you’re doing to leave lying in a ransom spot and don’t want to spend my life constantly on the lookout for hazards.   Does anyone else experience this?
eecdcb59532a6047e6fa37c1064ae744569ed052483ada02fb0b0666d194003c;;;Need advice... am I being unreasonable?;;;After 7 years of being together... my wife has never had a job once, and I’ve always been ok with that cause she was there to watch the kid while I worked full time. Even last year during the lockdowns it was fine cause she was there to homeschool the kid. Now this last year in October we just bought a house and moved to a new area, so her only responsibility is to wake up at 9am to get our kid to school by 9:50 and she can’t even do that. Every day it’s a struggle to get her to be on time, it’s always like arguing with 2 children.   My job is extremely physically demanding, and can have me on the road for a week at a time and during those weeks I work for 5am-8pm. Then I will have a week down with doing work from home (video editing) the week after. When I come home though, my body is broken, sore, tired, and aching, but I still always split the household duties like dishes, laundry, cleaning the house, and most of the time it’s not splitting it, I just do it because I know how overwhelming things can get when you don’t have any backup. I also take on stuff that she doesn’t do at all, like mowing the lawn and taking out the trash, which she would pile like a college kid playing jenga if I didn’t take it out. On top of my normal job and balancing time with my daughter, I am the one who fixes everything around the house when it breaks. When my wife is in a bad mood or tired, I’ll take our kid to playgrounds so she has time to herself, even though I’m the only one who has been working the entire length of our relationship and I could use days like that, I understand the optics of it cause to her it seems like just being away from home is a “rest” even though on those days I’m working nonstop for 10-12 hours, and I’d rather be home spending time with my daughter. All I ever ask is that she wakes up on time to get our daughter to school so she isn’t late, but my wife can’t even do that without me having to call to wake her up, set alarms several alarms, or when I am home I have to nudge her and wake her up like she is a kid. She will say “I’m up,” in a angry tone but I know she wasn’t awake cause I could hear her snoring again 🤦🏻‍♂️ It is like she gets offended when I call her out for falling back to sleep or when I say it’s time to get up.   At this point I’m ready to say screw it and start taking my kid to school on my own, and tell her to get her own place. This way she can actually understand how hard it is being the sole income earner and having to pay all the bills, on top of everything else that goes along with having your own place, and being a working parent. She has no concept of how hard I work, just so that she doesn’t have to work just so we can pay our bills, and all I ever need is for her to take our kid to school on time and spend time with her when I’m on the road for work. But even if I’m only gone for 2 days, she acts like it was the toughest time and is already overwhelmed by the time I get back home. What I don’t understand is why though, our daughter is in school 6 hours out of the day, she gets to bed at 8, so that leaves 4 hours a day that she has to spend time with her, even then it’s maybe 3 cause of dinner and other things. Even when I’m on the road I will have to call just to get our daughter to bed cause my wife would rather be her friend than her parent. Which I get cause it’s a balance, we are our kids first friends and we are also the ones who teach them limits and boundaries through discipline, but again, she doesn’t discipline. Instead she just gets frustrated and gives up so our daughter ends up getting to do what she wants, just without my wife as her best buddy for the time. So, I end up having to be the main one to discipline and balance the way my daughter views me because I don’t want her to think of me as the “bad guy,” since I am the one who has to discipline her for my wife.  If I ever speak up about her being late, forgetting to do stuff or any of the other stuff, she blows up and starts getting very defensive and extremely hostile. I have bipolar, and even I try to keep my calm because I know as soon as I lose my shit, it’s going to get out of hand. But she immediately loses her shit, threw the kids lunchbox at me and starts yelling that I don’t ever have to take our kid to school. All I could think was, she doesn’t ever have to work 15 hour days, get up at 4am to drive 10 hours across country just to work into the night, then still come home to chores around the house, and dealing with a spouse who never had to be a functioning adult on their own. Which doesn’t come out the best way after you’ve had a lunchbox thrown at your head 🥪🤕 After getting our kid to school late almost every day during the week, she just putz around the garden then is in a bad mood when our daughter gets off school. I’m honestly at my end, I don’t know how to deal with it anymore.   My wife is ADD and medicated, I handle the payments for it and got her set up cause she has a tough time scheduling and keeping appointments, so that’s one more thing I have to stay up on and adds outside stress. I NEVER hold this stuff over her head until days like this where she can’t even get our daughter to school on time and goes off the handle when I confront her. I’m tired of it, I’m tired of having to support someone, emotionally and financially, who doesn’t appreciate what they have or how much their partner does to maintain our life. I can’t do it anymore and I don’t know what to do about this, I don’t want to divorce but I also don’t want to live my life supporting someone who doesn’t appreciate what they have, and can’t even get up to take our kid to school on time. She said “I don’t care about being on time,” and I told her she should care about teaching our daughter to be on time, and that it will effect our daughter.   I want to make it very clear that I don’t care about her not working, or that I have to do chores around the house, cause it would be like that regardless if she was here or not. What I am upset about is the fact that she doesn’t appreciate or even recognize everything I do so we can maintain our life. On top of helping her keep things as organized as possible so she doesn’t become buried by the stress that comes with this life. What upsets me most though is that she gets mad when I call her out for making our daughter late 3 out of 5 days a week. All I ever wanted was for her to get used to doing something that was consistent, and regular, so she can get used to a schedule, but no matter what I do to make that load easier for her, she can’t keep up her end.   Am I being unreasonable here? If I am, then please help me figure out a better way to approach this issue... at this point I don’t know what to do anymore

A week ago my partner agreed to have a designated time and day (she chose Sunday at 6 pm) to work on our relationship and have actual quality time together. A week later she’s saying she’d rather work on her hobby and do our thing “later” because she’s tired and just wants to work on her hobby. I said no, that’s not okay. That I feel hurt, disrespected, and disregarded by her attitude, apparent indifference, and lack of interest in helping our marriage and keeping her word. She was noncommittal. Mind you she had already spent 4 hours on it today.   She then went and slept for a while, then went and spent more time working on her hobby despite what I had said and what she had originally promised. I just feel so crushed and depressed, yet also so angry and resentful. It’s bedtime in 50 minutes. We’ve hardly spent any time together this week and she has been nasty to me a couple of times over stupid things. Now this?   I don’t know whether to cry or yell. What do I do here??
ffb0d094e63a5779e78484c31a83376ad20c434c115deff9202f59e7ed877ea6;;;I feel guilty, crazy and frustrated all at the same time!;;;I (28F) am a spouse to my adhd-suggested husband (28M). We've been in couples counseling for over two years and he's don't tele-healtg in the past. Every counselor/professional we've worked with suggest he's textbook adhd. I preface this because since he's not working 1:1 with a counselor (yet, he's looking with insurance) there's no possibility for treatment for him.  So unmedicated and only couples counseling and I feel more frustrated than ever. I feel like my soul is withering away. Like my personhood is slowly fading out of existance. I've given everything to our relationship ( 8 years). He's a really sweet person. Always willing to help, has great humor and is a great dad to our eight month old son. He helps out with chores (I have a to-do list) and understands my chronic pain (I have INTENSE migraines and body pain flairs). He never speaks ill of me and in emergencies we're a great team. On alot of levels of life we are so compatible. *But* the LACK OF EMOTION IS KILLING ME. The lack of communication. The constant *sorry* about just not even talking to me for HOURS. When I try to share a peice of myself getting dead end comments *wow sounds frustrating* or totally taking the conversation for himself. The constant arguing and being defensive when I become frustrated with a behavior. The lack of follow through on anything. The lack of thoughtfulness. I feel like a glorified roommate that he sometimes is romantic with.  I feel disgusting. I'm dealing with alot of postpartum issues. My birth was traumatic and we almost lost our son. I was *physically* still recovering up until last month. Having a withering support is breaking me apart.  He tries. I see he tries. But there's a big part of me that feels like it's too late. We've been having issues for a *long* time and I have no idea how to help myself anymore. He's just starting to take it seriously. Just starting to read books and take charge of this part of his life. But..I'm still carrying to ENTIRE mental load. And not just of household things, I'm a SAHM right now so that's okay...but the entire mental load for the relationship? The romance, the dates (pandemic approved), the thoughtfulness. Even just CONVERSATION. *His* doctor appointments, his lunches, his time with our son.  I feel crazy because my husband is a good guy. But the lack of....*relationship* IN our relationship is destroying me.  Can anyone relate? How did you support yourself? How did you get through it? I'm in desperate need of some positive light in this. I feel like my husband could be my soulmate. But this same guy hurts my soul.  *update*- kinda: I wanted to thank everyone for their kindness and perspectives.  Last night was one of those nights I genuinely felt lost. To give a little background we've been together for eight years. For five of those eight years our communication withered with every passing day. He had to go away alot for different training/deployments (national guard) and I supported him while also working myself sick. We moved to a different state two years ago for his job and he promised me he would finally work on us. It took *having a baby* seven months ago to now get him to prioritize us. He's reading the ADHD and Marriage book (well listening, audio book). I've read it but I also needed to step away from being too involved. I needed to just focus on me and our son. Which is still a struggle. We are in couples counseling and we openly discuss our communication issues and discuss barriers for him and different techniques to help. Most of which feels like me giving the majority of energy and praying he meets me there.  I feel awful because of an empty emotional bucket (😅 what I refer to it) and I feel awful because I feel like I'm not supporting my husband more.

He just plays “tower defense” games on his phone, and occasionally looks up. But when he picks, he does watch it - and there’s only so much of Joe Rogan I can watch on YouTube lol. I feel guilty because he has ADHD (dx) and it’s difficult for him to follow most of our casual conversations.   Also for example, if I’m telling him a story:  “Banana called orange and told him that he went skiing today and broke his leg.”  He’ll cut me off and either fill in the sentence for me (which is always the wrong answer) or he’ll cut me off to tell me a story about someone he knows that broke their leg, and then (because I have a short attention span) we’ll talk about that, and never actually talk about my story.   I’m starting to wonder if he’s even interested in anything I say..and I’ve said that to him and he tells me how sorry he is, he loves me and doesn’t want me to feel like this. That it’s completely not true, and that he promises that he’s trying, it’s just really hard.   I’m patient, it doesn’t bother me that I usually have to keep my sentences short and to the point. But I would rather just like not offer to watch tv together if he’s not going to watch it. I’d rather just not talk if he’s always going to cut me off. Which I know has its consequences.   Side note- we have a really great relationship, I cannot stress to you all enough that he really is an amazing man in every single other way. I just don’t know how to bring this up without it creating an argument. I really dislike fighting, I love him so much. But I don’t want to hold it in, and eventually feel defeated and bitter.   Any advice that does not involve breaking up?

He is in his mid twenties and not medicated as he reacted poorly to attempts at it.  He is impulsive to an incredibly dangerous degree. We were sitting, cleaning up dinner. I had lit some candles. We have a spray bottle of alcohol for sanitizing things (covid), and I turn around to him *spraying it over the candles to make a fireball*. Thank God it didn't light anything on fire in our dining room.  Tonight he called me while driving home. We were talking and he suddenly said "shit, I got distracted and just blew through a red light. Of course there was a cop", so now we have to pay for a sudden ticket we can't afford.  Driving with him is terrifying because he constantly gets distracted. He'll change lanes or turn off the highway almost at random because of distractions. He'll start speeding up if he's talking about something passionate or listening to a tense podcast and not even notice.  I'm terrified for him, and increasingly for myself. He goes to therapy every two weeks but after months there's no improvement. Is there any direction I can point him in to getting meaningful help?

I've made many mistakes, and have been struggling coming to terms with all the issues I bring along with me. Over the past couple months I have been connecting so many lines, and realizing just how bad of an emotional support I can be sometimes.  A couple of days ago, I set it in my head that I was going to really turn things around. I've been trying to keep myself under control, and keeping things at a pace where I can manage better. The thing is that it still feels like there is a huge weight of everything from the past and it's something that takes a huge toll on my partner. She doesn't feel like I deserve any more chances, and I don't blame her. There has been so much back and forth, and so many times where I ask for a second chance only to mess up again without even realizing it. I don't know if I DO deserve a second chance, but all I know is I don't want to cause her any more pain. I feel like I keep dragging her down.  I know it's not the same for someone without ADHD to just move forward and forget all the bad things and try to start new, and I was just wondering if there was anything I can do to really show that I am trying to be better? I don't want to use my ADHD as an excuse.
e3d309e6f5a2d5989365e59293d81aaa08d654f68488a12ac78ab2082580b117;;;He never has anything to talk about;;;Anyone else have this problem? It's always my responsibility to create topics to talk about, and to maintain every conversation (we live apart). I'll talk about every mundane thing I've been doing, what I'm having for dinner, something interesting I've found online. When I ask him, it's like he's trying to be secretive, he'll tell me he's only been doing one thing...all day?? You never have anything to talk about at all?? Nothing interesting has happened? Why is it always my responsibility, I don't want to shoulder this entire burden anymore
a0282a7916ca5ada09187399a49cbeca750c3340557a16f0e247d3d5e502abe1;;;Handling your partner’s family;;;Ever have one of those moments where your partner just breaks your heart and brain simultaneously and you’re just done for the day? Yeah. I’m there. Been there since 10 am.   My husband (Dx’d, medicated, when he remembers to take them) has a particularly demanding family. Naturally, as he can’t remember or doesn’t think to do anything, all of the demands fall on me.   After the epic gigantic shit show and struggle it was to pull together everything for Halloween for his family, I told him if his family wanted any pictures or zoom time for thanksgiving he had to handle it.  Of course, it never happened and now his mom is just SO depressed and mad and doesn’t understand why no one keeps in touch.   Anyone, on to today, he managed to pull together two zoom meetings for his family. One of which had been changed four times because his family is roughly as good at planning and scheduling things as he is. His SIL asked me to get pictures of the kids for MIL.   And all I asked him to do was help set the kids down for photos (he didn’t cooperate and neither did the kids, I sent the shitty photos, it is what it is.) And then I just asked him to occupy the kids for a whole three minutes while I sent photos.  That was it...just let me send the photos.  As usual. It was a fight. A debate. “Why can’t you do it later, why does it have to be now, why can’t you just give daughter your phone, other daughter is upset just take her, what’s the difference between doing them now and later...” Guys.  All because I needed a couple minutes to send photos HIS FUCKING FAMILY wanted.  I’m just done for today. I’m simultaneously raging and crying. It hurts even more because most of my family is estranged and I can’t even zoom or be with the family I do have left. I don’t have safe parents to give pics of my kids to. I can’t zoom my sister because my parents might be there and we don’t contact them for safety reasons.  I can’t be with my aunt because she’s a healthcare worker, she’s alone and depressed and I’m depressed without her, but I had to get the house ready for his brother to come (and it was days of this constant debate and fight bullshit to get ready for his brother too.)   He couldn’t just say “okay” for the two or three minutes to send pics to his family. I have to goddamn yank out all of his goddamn teeth just to get THREE MINUTES for HIS family. And my family is just too fractured and shitty to even have around. He doesn’t appreciate his family enough to throw on goddamn Peppa pig and let someone else do all the work for him for three minutes.  I can’t stop crying. It did me in; I’m hiding with my napping daughter and somehow I have to pull myself together enough for the second zoom meeting with his mom ( the first one was me desperately trying to accomodate and get the kids to behave while he just obliviously chattered away.) and not be a complete mess in front of his brother.   Merry fucking Christmas. And big hugs and solidarity to all the partners out there exhausted by pulling all of the Christmas cheer and magic out of their ass all by themselves.

We’ve worked through a lot of hard things but sleep is really killing us. He refuses to follow any sleep hygiene advice, consistently claiming “nothing works” for him. In the mornings I’m up first, he snoozes for anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours. Some days he’s asleep the entire time. Some days he’s talking to me but an hour later he can’t remember the conversation. Am I the problem? Do I need to just let this go? I try to encourage him to do the bare basics - waking up and falling asleep at the same time each day, not playing video games in bed, etc, but it seems like I’m fighting a losing battle and I don’t know what to do anymore.
5f23353e69567c3cc1875b28f45bed63d102e05d497935096193bffcc26d324a;;;Vent;;;Thank you advance to anyone who will read this and empathize with me. You guys are the best.   I’ve had a really hard few days. I have been extremely stressed and overwhelmed and barely holding it together. I got into an accelerated nursing program that allows me to get my associates and bachelors in nursing at the same time. Yesterday, I realized my FIRST term will cost 6k. The stress of the election. My oldest has been going through some stuff. It’s just been a lot.   My husband works 10hr swings Sunday- Wednesday. So the majority of the week I’m solo for all the kids needs. Practices into the evening. Homework. Dinner. Bath. You get it.   He had the day off today but wanted to help out a Mutal friend by replacing his alternator. No problem! Glad he can help out like that. He was gone from 6am to 6pm. He finished the job early in the day. He never checked in with me to ask if I needed help with the kids and practices and all that. HE KNOWS I’ve been hanging on by a thread. It just felt like such a punch to the gut. He apologized profusely. But I’m so sick of the “I lost track of time”. “I forgot”. “I meant to”.   We have three young kids. One of which isn’t even in Kinder till next year. I start nursing school in January. I’m terrified. I think I will be in school MORE than full time and still the primary parent and adult. I don’t have a support system. No close (involved) family. No really solid friends.   I don’t know how I can accept this kind of behavior. Even if it’s the ADHD and he didn’t “mean” to. And this is a classic example of the straw that broke the camels back. I needed him to be aware. He wasn’t. It all builds over time and then I’m boiling. Everything is even on a shared calendar!!!   I’m so burnt out. And so pissed off. Thank you for reading.
c56e0a05ac726b68252053627bccc1aa9f087737e356a41f569922dd646ae172;;;Is it normal for an ADHD partner to get meaner when faced with emotion?;;;My partner always gets far more cruel when I begin to cry. And if I begin to cry, it’s because I’m falling apart so it’s obviously the most unwelcome time.  He yells louder and gets crueler and says he’s invulnerable to my tears.  Is that an ADHD trait or is it verbal abuse? Does anyone else feel like they can’t always see the line there, or is that telling of my relationship?
1ad68d495d9f755a8ca62c9d481eed1f2cc9f0b923e24e7eeeaa5d77c953d4b6;;;Struggling to be patient with my ADHD partner;;;I (f, 28) am struggling to be patient with my (m, 29) ADHD (DX) partner. We have been together a long time and I love him very very much. I am just looking for sympathy and maybe advice if there is any out there.  One aspect of his ADHD that I really struggle with is the amount time he takes to make decisions and carry out tasks. I understand how important it is to let someone with ADHD decide or do something for themselves and not have me take over for them, and as I am a decisive and proactive person this requires an immense amount of patience from me. I try very hard not to do things for him and let him come to a conclusion or carry out a task on his own. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed and sad when we miss out on important things that one or both of us wants because my partner has taken too long to make a decision, send an email, or make a phone call.  For example, we have recently lost out on house we were trying to buy because he took too long on deciding whether to go ahead after the seller had accepted our offer, and the seller got bored of waiting for us and accepted a different offer. When the seller and our solicitor pressed us for an answer it made him more stubborn in his indecision. He has missed out on job opportunities because he did not get his CV in before the deadline. On a smaller scale we have missed many a date night because he can't decide what to do or where to go, and then before he's decided the evening is over. Fellow partners of ADHD-folk, how do you cope with this aspect of your loved one? I don't want to be bitter towards him because I know its not his fault, but I can't help feeling sad and frustrated sometimes.

I couldn’t sleep until 3 am last night because I felt terrible and was ruminating about all of this. I’m trying to make sense of a situation to determine what my next steps should be. If anyone is willing to read and provide advice, I would greatly appreciate it.   **Background**: My wife and I have been married 7 years, have 3 children (6, 3, 1), the 3 year old has pretty severe special needs (rare genetic disorder). I work two jobs year round and one contractual job that lasts about a month every July. My hours are down a little right now (COVID) and I probably  work about 50 hours/week on average - no more than I have to right now.  My wife stays home with the children and does not work. This was a mutual decision. She gets up with my daughter, who has sleep issues, for around 1 hour each night,. She spends a lot of time taking care of her, acts as her OT, PT, SLP, and teacher because everything is virtual for my daughter right now. It is a lot. My daughters issues coupled with a 1 year old definitely wear on her. My job can be stressful at times as well.  My **wife** is DX, medicated, and has been working on developing strategies to manage her ADHD through a facebook support group for individuals with ADHD.  My **sister-in-law** (SIL) is DX, medicated, but has not developed many strategies to manage her ADHD yet.  My **mother-in-law** (MIL) is NDX, not medicated. She did try my SIL’s Concerta once and remarked that it helped her be much more productive. She is 62 and seems to have developed some strategies to manage her ADHD, although I wouldn’t call her ADHD well managed.  I do not have ADHD. I have suffered from anxiety, depression, and body-focused repetitive behaviors most of my life. I have been in therapy for 6 months and am medicated for my mental illness and have made a lot of progress over the past year - but I still struggle. I have fairly serious trust issues probably stemming from childhood trauma.  **Situation**:   **April-May** \- **Quarantine** \- We lived with my in-laws. Although I absolutely did not want to, I did so because my wife needed help with the kids beyond what I could provide and we had lost all respite care and babysitters due to COVID. This was generous of my in-laws and I appreciate it. Everyone quarantined and worked from home, except my sister-in-law who was living there as well. Her exposure was limited at the time but higher than I was comfortable with- she saw her friends occasionally. I told my wife that my SIL, who has ADHD and has not developed significant coping strategies, is a huge risk to get COVID in part because of her ADHD and recklessness. She ended up testing positive for COVID in July.  **June - Death -** My MILs brother, wife’s uncle, was sick and had COVID symptoms. He has no immediate family and lives near my MIL. He was independent but my MIL checked up on him often. She knew he had COVID symptoms. According to my MIL, he told her that he called the doctor and the doctor said “You’re fine. You just need to rest at home. Don’t come in to the hospital.” My MIL did not check up on him again - no calling, visiting, etc. He lives 5 minutes from my MIL. I would never say this out loud, but in a small way, I think my MIL’s ADHD played a role in her brother’s death. He had been dead for a week in his apartment when someone else found his body. My MIL blames herself in part for not checking in on him and for not pressing the issue that he should seek medical attention. We found out from the medical examiner, who received his medical records, that his doctor actually told him it is likely COVID and advised him to seek immediate medical attention. He ignored that advice and lied to my MIL about it according to her. My in-laws have not disclosed the autopsy results.  **July - Positive COVID and Quarantine -** SIL tests positive. I predicted this back in April. She said “It was probably this random person I was talking to on the street who said they were sick.” That left me a bit stunned. We had to quarantine for 2 weeks and get a test (that nasal swab is terrible!). We continued to quarantine for 2 additional weeks because we had a family vacation planned with my in-laws and we wanted to be as cautious as possible so as to not expose my in-laws to COVID. Quarantine was hard because of my daughter’s special needs. On vacation we did not distance from each other, but were distanced from all others. As far as COVID, it was a fairly safe vacation.  **August - A Difficult Decision -** My wife and I had a thorough discussion and came to an agreement following vacation that our exposure going forward was high - not by choice - and that we should not see my in-laws until the situation changes and we can re-evaluate. My in-laws know that we are struggling daily to meet our needs and the needs of our children, so it was especially important for me, and my wife agreed, that we tell them explicitly that our exposure is too high right now for us to see them and that we can seek help elsewhere. We even told them that we should zoom more often, like we do with my parents, so that the kids can see them. I suggested fun Zoom activities. They have not yet really taken that up. We did not want them to help out and put themselves at risk just because we were struggling. I have been hiring baby sitters to come over to watch the kids so we can get caught up on chores and so that my wife can nap. My wife and I agreed that things are still tough but this works for us and is something we can deal with.  **September - COVID Exposure and Betrayal -**  MIL wanted to see her grandkids and I agreed that it would be okay, so long as she understood what our exposure is like. Also important to note that it is not possible for my 3 year old or 1 year old to wear a mask and  my MIL was picking them up and holding them right next to her face.   She came over on Tuesday morning. Tuesday afternoon I got a call that my son’s teacher had tested positive. I immediately called my wife and said “this is exactly the situation that I was trying to avoid. This is why I don’t think it is prudent for your mother to see us right now. Do you agree?“ She agreed with me. I said “Is this something that you want to talk to your mom about by yourself? Are we on the same page with this?” She replied yes. She told her that we shouldn’t see each other right now and told her about our son’s teacher testing positive. My MIL cried but said she understood.   Friday, my father-in-law asked me to call him. I called him and the essence of what he was saying was that my MIL is still sad over the death of her brother in July and that seeing the grandkids makes her happier. This was a brief conversation that we agreed to continue later as I was driving with my son in the car and it didn’t seem appropriate to discuss in front of him. My father-in-law was pressuring me to change our decision to not see them for the time being.   I said goodbye feeling very confused and uncertain about the situation. I didn’t understand why they are pressuring us to change our decision. I told my wife that I needed some time to talk to my parents, who we are also not seeing right now to avoid unnecessary risk. I wanted to get their perspective so I could make sense of the situation. I talked with my dad for about an hour and it helped. I then talked with my wife about it and said I just don’t understand why my FIL called me and pressured me and I don’t understand after the past few months why they can’t understand that we want to be cautious - after a COVID death, two positive tests, and two quarantines.   I literallly said to my wife “You and I are on the same page with this. Why wouldn’t they talk to you first?” Eventually, my wife confessed that when she talked with her mom she told her “If it were just up to me, we would keep seeing you.”  That was not what we discussed when I talked with my wife about the situation. She never once told me that she felt that way. So, I just learned that my wife was not honest with me, undermined me to her parents, and I feel like she essentially told her parents “this is my husbands fault.” I have trust issues and this has sent me in a bit of a tail-spin. I don’t know how to proceed except truthfully with all parties. I’m not sure how to feel about my wife right now. I feel betrayed, lied to, undermined, and I’m not sure how to start trusting her again.  If you have read this far - thank you. I don’t think I have ever written a post so long! If you have any thoughtful advice I would sincerely appreciate it. My feelings are very confused right now.
088aae1c53997e1fec7c2c71bddb52a95ed36f5d0bf39be209ed566674255b15;;;I’m depressed and taking everything way too personally;;;So, the title is fairly straight forward - but I’m just unusually depressed. It’s part quarantine blues, part insane workload, and probably part natural chemical imbalance as well. I’m considering medication, but that’s not what this is about.  My partner is as kind as they come, so I know that nothing is truly intentional. However, he still has ADHD with a greater focus on the AD. He is constantly on his phone on either twitter, Reddit, YouTube, and listening to podcasts.  This makes getting his attention to feel like a task, and one that feels humiliating if I fail at it. I feel unwanted and annoying simply because I’ll be talking to him and nothing I say is heard. Of course, if I walk away and cry and he notices, he feels awful...and then I just feel worse for making him feel bad about his disability.  He is getting medicated, and I know it’ll help with work...but in the past, it’s only just made him pay attention the phone even more when it comes to personal life. I’m just not sure what to do (and while I know it’s not his job to make me happy - I’m having a hard time doing it by myself at the moment).

Please be gentle! 😁  My husband has been diagnosed ADHD since he was 7yrs old. He was on a lot of meds that never worked for him as a kid. He's not on meds now because he's damn near phobic of them. He has just started the counseling process and hasn't had a "real" appointment yet. We've been married almost 10 yrs. In the beginning the sex was great and frequent. On our wedding night he said he was too tired to have sex. Little did I know, I would hear this phrase several times a week. Fast forward to year three and the sex is maybe once a month and it's stayed this way with the occasional bouts of no sex for 3 or 4 months. We've had many discussions, heart to heart talks and arguments about this topic. I like sex. I like to have sex. He likes sex. He seems to enjoy having sex with me and is always willing so "show" me how turned on I make him, yet it rarely leads to sex. He's been promising for almost 7 years to get more sleep so he won't be so tired all the time. Here we are in 2020 and he still gets, on a good night, 4-5 hours sleep. He works as an ink press operator, which some days is physically demanding and other days he literally "stands around all day",  his words not mine. He is unwilling to change his schedule at home it seems. He promises he'll change, but only does so for maybe two days, the longest was 1 week. No matter how many timers, calendar reminders or in person reminders he receives, he just can't seem to get more sleep. He can't get away from his phone or his computer. When he gets in bed, he is generally asleep and snoring within 15 mins. I know because I have trouble sleeping and I'm up much later than him, sometimes reading reddit while laying next to him. 😁 He is incapable it seems of creating new routines, even with help. I don't like reminding him of stuff very much anymore now, because it doesn't have much of an effect. I know logically I shouldn't feel like the most unattractive person in the world, but I do. I would like to have sex more than once a month of once every two months. I have tried letting him initiate, which is how we get the once a month. If I initiate I get turned down 20 times out of 21 attempts. I've asked him if he would be okay with us opening our marriage up and he is not okay with that. So I feel pretty stuck. Yes, sex isn't everything in a relationship, but it is important and it's important to me. It used to be important to him too. I have worked very hard to over come a lot of sexual abuse in my past to have a healthy sexual relationship with him and I feel like I wasted my time. I'm not asking for sex every day, just maybe once a week. There is also the feeling that in 20 years sex may not be that physically possible for me because I have degenerative disc disease, bone spurs on several vertebrae and something wrong with my neck as well. If my father is an indication of where I will be, then I will be unable to lay in many, many positions and my extremities will have gone numb. I feel like my window for sex is very limited, as in I will literally lose the ability to preform.  Am I really asking for too much? Is this a normal issue for people with ADHD? I'm sorry if this was a ramble. I tried to make it coherent. I'm very depressed over this issue. Thank you for taking the time to read my post. I hope you are all having a good day. ♥️  Edit: I really appreciate you ppl taking the time to comment. There was a lot of very good advice and a bunch of empathy. Thank you for helping me not feel so alone in this. I did discuss the morning sex option that has been suggested and my husband was surprised because he thought that was a no go from me. So I said I'd love to see how it works out and meet him half way in this. It's only been one day but I'm much happier and the husband seems happier too! Again, thank you everyone! 😊🥰

We do our best to help each other with general adulthood things. Which means I end up doing lots of housework and keep them on schedule with things. But. This often comes across as nagging. I don't want to be that guy, but at a certain point, things need done. Do any of you have any strategies that seem to work?

I was once so patient, but after a couple of years dealing with the defensiveness, I turn to rage and just yell. I don't mean to, but I'm so fed up, it's like a demon takes over and I just rage. It doesn't matter how simple...did you remember to take out the garbage before bed? "I SAID I'D DO IT LATER." Hey, Bob, when's the last time you changed the baby? "I DON'T KNOW! I DON'T KNOW!" Can you just tell me if it was in the past hour? "I SAID I DON'T KNOW!" Well, was it 30 minutes ago? Diaper seems very full and it's leaking onto his onesie? "FINE, SURE, IT WAS 30 MINUTES AGO!" He's not yelling, but he has such a defensive tone like I'm attacking his entire 32 years of existence on this planet. And I say, "Bob, take a step back. Do you see how defensive you're getting when I ask a simple question?" Then I get so angry, I just yell! "Ya know what mf. Forget about it. I'll figure it all out myself!" Then later he'll cry and apologize. And I ask him why apologize when this behavior will just happen again and again? I feel my life has been taken away. I know it's just as frustrating for him to organize his thoughts and try to remember, but constantly getting bootyhurt like that and getting defensive like I've just attacked his entire being has killed all communication and I'm left crying and wanting to just run away. Like, ffs.

Is this their emotional dysregulation?  It really hurts and I feel alone and don't know how to get over it.   I try to just remember how good he is to me most of the time but that doesn't always help in the moment when I'm in tears.   And then I get blamed for crying and told I have no reason to cry and to stop.  It sucks that he seems to have ZERO self-awareness when he's in this emotional state.

I'm not married and I don't have children but I ultimately want them.  I've been in a relationship for six years.  We live together.  My partner can be everything I want but he can also be truly awful. He wants to get better but often just gets more preoccupied with everything else has has going on and forgets which leads to a list of illegitimate reasons for breaking promises.  In the past three years, he's seen two different therapists individually - the first sucked, CBT was a godsend but was not affordable - and consequently we're in couples therapy because it ensures the relationship narrative is two-sided, there's accountability, and the cost is split between us.  The therapist is lovely and I really trust him and he makes excellent, affecting points, but just the week-by-week process is excruciatingly slow and even slower when my ADHD partner falls out of the commitment of going.    It feels like we are more than just compatible, but genuinely a perfect match with so much potential that's continually eviscerated by the ADHD.  I feel like dealing with this and it's effects on my decision-making, self-esteem, personhood, etc. have really made it hard to make such a huge decision, which isn't just breaking up but really severing ties, moving out, starting over completely, etc.  I haven't been able to talk to friends because they are such proponents of walking away without care for the nuances of the disorder and my partner always remains committed and insists we should continue to figure it out together.  I wish I had a friend who fully understood how high the highs are and how truly low the lows are that could provide advice I relate to.  I would appreciate advice from those that stayed, those that walked away, or those that wish they did.

He isn't diagnosed but I am about 90% sure.   I'd love to hear what people who have been with their ADHD partners long term would tell their younger selves before getting into the relationship? What expectations did you have at the beginning that have had to change? What mistakes were made? Unexpected struggles/challenges? But also the unexpected delights of being with someone with ADHD?

He is the life of the party, extremely extroverted, always cracking jokes at everything. and I mean everything. This is great when he's just a friend of yours, when you get all of the fun none of the burden, but I am starting to lose my patience. I cannot stand making jokes at everything, I don't need all the things to be funny. I am struggling to have a deep conversation while he just cuts it off with a witty comment and I'm left with all these unspoken thoughts, but for him the topic is finished and he needs to move on to the next one. I am an introvert and I'm passionate for deep and long conversations about the tiniest details so I can understand a certain topic thoroughly. For him this is just boring. He is an intelligent creative person but talking about one thing for too long just makes him irritated, and I don't want to only be focusing on being funny and exciting when talking to him. I also feel that any problem that I have for him is just soo easy to belittle, not like he is not supportive but he never sees the whole picture with all the complications, he always oversimplifies it.  I feel exhausted with this. I feel like we are always just babbling about everything. The work, friends, food, usual stuff. But what I really love to do is having heated debates, arguing about movies or books, going through thought experiments.  Is it possible for him to not be bored by things like these? I love the quick wit and he's a great guy. But the golden-retriever-oversimplification gives me such a hard time sometimes.

My partner is waiting for his appointment be diagnosed, not medicated yet, but 100% sure he has ADHD.I have been trying to research some ways to deal with him and get him to help me more with the chores... I am so tired of doing everything, and even when he finally does something, he doesn't do it properly or stopping halfway, so anyways he is not much of a help and all the chores are on me.  I'm really hoping that medication and therapy will help him, but I know it's not like the medication will magically make ADHD disappear. Even though he really wants to change and be better at helping me, it doesn't happen and he just spends another day laying on the sofa, while I'm running around, do the groceries, cook, clean, WHILE I need to concentrate on my studies as well, and it sometimes feel like he just makes my life harder.. Leaves his clothes all over, the bathroom is fucking disgusting, the kitchen is a mess.. I just can't deal with it anymore. I'm not a maid to just run around and clean up his mess, but if I don't do it, I just end up living in a nasty apartment, which is even worse.  I'm just not sure how to talk to him about it, I tried several times, he always promises to do everything and this time he is actually gonna make an effort etc.. NEVER happens.  I am really desperate.. Every once in a while I just feel like I can't do this anymore, and I love him a lot, but I can't imagine him as a future husband or father of my children. This is not the way I want to live my life.. :(  How can I motivate him or is there any strategy to try that could be helpful? I would really appreciate some help!!

I have ADHD - yesterday, it snowed really bad - today, I had work at 12. My husband told me “be up at 10:30, no later” He checked in on me at that time, saw that I was awake and starting to get ready - then wordlessly went outside and cleared my car 100% in “breathable” sneakers because he doesn’t have winter boots. We forgot to buy a shovel when we moved in, so he kicked the ground and cleared the snow as best as he could.  He then came in and helped me finish getting ready and getting everything I needed - hat, gloves, water bottle, wallet, etc. This was so extremely helpful - I’ve been doing really well being on time for work, but that’s with minimal traffic, not having to drive really slow, not having to defrost my car and clear it off. If I had been left to my own devices, I likely would have been really overwhelmed this morning, forgotten things, and possibly been late.   Thank you to all the partners who do such selfless acts. I don’t know how your partner feels, but it’s a breath of fresh air and helps me get “caught up” so I can function like a normal human being. I’m making dinner tonight, cleaning, and sharing my favorite ice cream with him.
4b192b9ad2d13699ac081c37ec11e8367e35544dd3513e2ab39923fb7f2ed20f;;;I ended my relationship with my ADHD dx BF;;;    Hi It’s a long story that I tried to keep short of my relationship with my ADHD partner, it is my side of my story and I just need to vent out since I’m currently in the process of getting over on my break up.  \---  I newly moved in Australia for work, I have no relatives or friends here but it did not bother me much I’m excited to take the challenge, and so I met this cute, wonderful and sensitive man through dating app, we dated and we hit it off really fast. First few weeks that we dated I noticed that he doesn’t keep his promises, he doesn’t take me out for a date as he said he would but since its covid time, nothing is open so I accepted that, even though I can think of a lot of things to do without going to restaurant. So I suggested that we go for a park I was pretty excited about that and when the day came I was dressed just ready for him to arrive, when the day came he cancelled out for the last minute and my gut feeling said no. This is not right, I feel that I was being treated like whatever so I broke off with him, what I did not expected was I feel so strongly for him, long story short I fell in love and my heart and brain keeps on fighting and in the end I said ok lets try again, I will not be judgmental and try to work this out.   So I reach out to him and we got back together, we went on and off a couple few times and every time I broke up with him or he broke up with me it really breaks my heart. One day when we were just settled for being friends he mentioned that he had ADHD. I’ve heard of it but I never knew about it, so I researched, watched videos and eventually found this support group. Everything made sense and I sympathize with him, it must be so hard to have this kind of condition while people assume that you should be normal so I tried to understand him, there comes a point that he was down and was ready to give up since he lost his job and he doesn’t have enough money to live here in Australia since he was a student and working here.   I offered my place I told him that he was welcome to stay until he got back from his feet and we got back together at same time, from then on I see his behavior differently, I gave more patience and become more sympathetic in his condition. I though I can make it, I even think we would last and will eventually end up together however, reality slowly comes crushing down on me. The cleaning, 8+ hours of games, sleeping half a day and the rest social media, games and shows hit me. I gave more patience because I know this is ADHD at work but what rubs me raw is not once did he asked me out for us to go on a date, spend time together or do something together. We will go out half a day then the other half until the next morning he will play his game at the café.   I’m always the one who asked out. I think that my love for him start dying when on my Birthday that I have to remind him 3x yet he did not bring me anything. He just greeted me Happy Birthday preheated a bread and went out to his part time work. When he got home he just bought two beers and two instant curry for his lunch tomorrow then proceeds to let out his frustrations for the day. I thought I will receive flowers or even a cupcake for my birthday but none. The next morning we have plans to at least go to the beach so we can celebrate my Birthday, I woke up early and waited for him I expected him to at least at my important day he will have an initiative to wake up or be excited for us to go and celebrate since he never fail to set an alarm for his work and he always follow up with his cousin on where they are going if his cousins invites him.  half day later he's still in bed, I got angry, showered and get dressed to go out and he just said to me you’re going? And I said yes, he said are you ok? (obviously not) but I said yeah and he said ok have fun. And I went out and I was really, really bitter that day walking alone and just bought myself a cake and ate it alone at a café. From that day on I got my walls up, we got on some fights and every time we have one my love for him became less and less even though he tells me he likes me so much, I’m the best person he ever met, the best GF and etc. Until we had a heavy fight and after we calmed down the following days then months we stopped being intimate, I thought to myself that maybe he decided for us to be friends but he doesn’t have the balls to tell me or this might be ADHD? his hyper focus on me is over, I don’t know. But one time he told me that if I want to do something (sex I believe) I have to ask for it. And when I heard it, it sounds ridiculous why would I have to ask for sex? And when I tell him my frustrations about his lack of attention or etc he tells me you just have to tell me. And I hate it every time he say that. Why do I have to tell you? Don’t you have initiative? That’s what I keep on thinking. Eventually he moved out of my apartment and it got me to a long depression almost every day. He only visits me to pick up his stuff or when he needs a parking from the city.  The last draw was when I’ve been planning for months for the both of us on this coming holiday and when I’m telling him about my plans he told me that we were suppose to go to his friends xmas dinner or lunch (I don’t know exactly since he doesn’t know if it would be xmas eve or day) it hurts me that he assumes that we will go to his friend when I’ve been planning here alone for months now.   I told him that if he wants to go, he’s free to go but I will go as planned. I’ve been generous enough to say that we will go if the date for my plan will not be in conflict with his friends’ and he laughed at me and said I was such a Sheldon (from the show big bang theory). Everything has to be on schedule, even laundry has to be on Friday and at that moment I was thinking he was just laughing at me and its just like I’m just seeing him for the first time. I asked again on what his opinion about my plans and he just told me I don’t know, I don’t care whichever’. And then I knew its over, I don’t want this anymore, I've felt depressed, alone and I've been crying honestly even before he moved out. I ended it.   Right now I feel numb, sad and I don’t really have a support here since I live here alone. I talked to my family about it but its never the same since they were not with me. Its hard.. it was really, really hard but I thought its better now than later. I realized I was never happy from the beginning and I should have followed my gut feeling to save me this trouble.  Thank you for reading this, this is my side of the story and I know I also made mistakes. My Ex is a wonderful person that's unfortunately had ADHD condition but I'll never know if its his personality that's rotten or ADHD.   This channel has been my support and reference from my ex's behaviour. Thank you for posting your stories and heartaches I admire you all for staying to your partners I wish you all the best.

Sent me a picture for proof and everything! I’m not exactly sure what to expect and I know I won’t see results right away, but I’m so happy he finally did it. This seems like a major step in the right direction.
5b6417440ce945f978cb807ef8ac84fa2b9664090f653e0f55d39aa7261e459a;;;Would it be reasonable for me to request that my partner do something right when I ask? Am I a bossy jerk?;;;My husband (39, with ADHD) and I (33) have been kind of sinking lately. We’re basically in the process of rebuilding our entire lives after a major collapse (mentally, financially, etc) a couple years ago. We’re both stressed to the max but we’re both empathetic people and are generally patient with each other. I usually don’t mind having to carry an unequal amount of the mental load of managing our lives because I tend to be very detail oriented and feel more comfortable being behind the wheel, knowing things are getting done, while he has trouble with the details and is more “big picture”. But lately, maybe it’s because his stress levels are up due to work or whatever else, it seems like he’s stopped trying AT ALL and I feel like it’s turning me into an insufferable bitch. All the reminders I have to give out between him and my teenager (fuck online high school OMG), I have been so irritable. (I want I add also that he is normally somewhat on top of his ADHD, so it hasn’t just been me managing his shit for the entire relationship.)  While I usually don’t mind giving him some reminders to get things done, I don’t want to remind him multiple times until he feels like doing it. Ideally it would be like “Hey, the dogs really need a bath, can you take care of that this weekend?” And he makes a note of it, maybe writes it down somewhere and then takes care of it whenever during the weekend that he feels like doing it. Honestly even if he said “no I can’t do that this weekend for X reason” would be better for me than what is currently happening- where he tells me what he thinks I want to hear, probably has the intention of completing the task, but takes no steps to ensure he’ll actually remember to do it.   My husband is a wonderful person, he’s not lazy. If I ask him to do something and tell him “this needs to be done immediately” he’ll get up and do it. But it makes me feel gross and bossy and I don’t want there to be that kind of dynamic in our relationship where I have to resort to making demands to ensure that things get done.   I got fed up yesterday and said I need to see some kind of action to indicate to me that he’s making an effort to manage his ADHD and his to-do list. He said he’s going to make an appointment today with a doctor to see about going on medication, which I think is a strong step in the right direction.   But in the meantime? I guess what I’m asking is, would I be a total monster if, while he’s working on this, I resorted to saying “I need you to do this right now, not ten minutes from now when you’ll forget and I’ll have to remind you” a little more often (usually reserved for super urgent tasks). Obviously I’ll have to talk to him about this later and it’s not sustainable long term. We have some communication issues to work out and I see some therapy in our future. BUT please tell me if it would make me a super asshole if I put on my bossy pants for awhile, because I can’t do the reminder thing at all right now. I want to be a good person!   All advice is welcome but please be nice, I am sensitive and the internet is scary lol.

I'm due to move in soonish with my other half, unmedicated ADHD, and would love ideas for things we can do that might make things easier?

My partner is NDX ADHD (28yrs). 5 years in with 2 children and I find myself constantly thinking ‘will this ever get better?’. I am 100% alone in this relationship. I know and understand that he has no control over some things but there are times where it just feels like such a personal attack.   Our relationship started off amazing...until I fell pregnant and became the ‘boring’ one per say. This is when I started to notice that there was always something/someone that was more important (literally anything). I was no longer a priority and it felt like I had been thrown in the gutter. I still held on because I thought maybe he was just struggling coming to terms with being a father and new responsibilities. I suffered pretty bad PND and was hospitalised. During this time, I really tried to put all my energy in healing myself and building the relationship with our child. He never said it, but his actions spoke a thousand words. I was being to needy and he had no interest in it. He started to stop visiting, constantly out with his mates getting pissed/high/I’ll never really know. BUT there were still moments where I felt his love and could see his love for our child.   Fast forward 2 years, still the same things. Phone/people/anything of interest to him was more important. Anything to do with myself or our child was boring to him. While he was the fulltime worker (and I will always give him credit for having such good work ethic), asking him to contribute to anything for the child was just a big NO. There was no problems getting loans/finance to buy cars/motorbikes/anything that he was interested in but soon as I’d mention ‘babe we need to buy this’ he wasn’t having a bar I’d it. I still longed for his love and attention. I didn’t want to tarnish his relationship with our child, and honestly didn’t want our child to have a broken family like I had.   Fell pregnant again, was an even worse pregnancy experience for me. I don’t even know how to explain it because I feel like nobody out there would understand. I was mentally stronger this time and was able to build quite a strong support network with my family & friends. Until my family moved 3 hours away and I was left in our town alone. Partner knew it was taking a big toll on me and would encourage me to go visit my parents for a couple of days almost every fortnight. What a big difference it was making! I got to get away with our kids and actually had help. Not to mention my cup was being filled. Turned out he just wanted us out of the house and 3 hours away because he knew he could get away with whatever toxic activity meant more than his family (drinking/drugs).   I’m not saying he is a bad father, but if I am true to myself what father would risk it all so he can just go out and impress his mates for a night or go and get high. Our children absolutely adore their Daddy. Our eldest (3) thinks he is just the best. But when they want to interact with him or get his attention, he snaps at them. Tells them to sit down and watch tv. To be quiet and don’t interrupt him on his phone. It’s all about what he wants to give on his terms. Our youngest is a lot less trusting in him for emotional needs. Their relationship is different, they’ve struggled to gel from the beginning.   The constant lies, lack of care, lack of emotion. It’s so freaking hard! There is ALWAYS something more important than me no matter what I do. I’m always the one nagging him. He will lie to my face and then when I confront him on his behaviours, he gets so defensive and nasty. But then will go into this depressive spiral when he gets caught saying he does love me and doesn’t understand why his brain messes up all the time and begs me not to leave. That he only got angry and nasty because he knew he done wrong and does want to disappoint me again. I carry the weight of this home on my back. All responsibilities are on me. Yes, he does work. But I cook/clean/raise children/do all the boring adult stuff. If I ask him for help with something around the home he will say ‘I’ll do it tomorrow’ then before you know it, it’s a month later and still not done. Any reminders I give him are nagging.   Fast forward to now, I feel like I’m drowning. Reaching out to him for help and he’s just not there.   I’m constantly keeping our problems hidden, constantly putting on this brave face to our families, constantly trying to support and build his relationship with our children. And as for the relationship between him and I? I just don’t know. Iv never been able to actually express what’s happened over the years without the fear of judgement. Am I stupid to hold on to hope? Hope that one day he will wake up and realise what he has? That I am special to him? That our children should be his top priority? That he has an amazing family waiting for him to come home each night? Have I just messed with our children’s head by allowing all these negative behaviours? My questions are endless.

I wanted to understand him better to help him and our relationship. But all the time I spent reading articles, listening to podcasts and spending hours on the internet. I didn't realize the strain the relationship was causing me. Toward the end of our relationship I realized a lot of things that were not right. His emotions were all over the place, he had no patience at all, he was constantly distracted and finding something new to distract himself with. In the end, he told me that his love for me wasn't constant. He felt it sometimes but not every time. I have read about people who have ADHD usually over analyze everything about their new partner and it was so true. He told me things about myself that no one ever told me and it made me self conscious and caused me to watch everything I did. The last month we were dating it was very emotional. I now see that he was just confused on what to do with our relationship and he felt stuck. He told me a lot of truths toward the end that sort of stung but I'm over them now. He decided that we should take a break and I agreed, we could clear our minds and come back together. We ended up breaking up a few days later.   After we broke up there was a month of us texting on and off but it was awkward. I felt like we were both trying to hold on but we couldn't commit. Or well he couldn't. I wanted to try and date again but he was constantly changing his mind each week. To this day I still wonder if he regrets us breaking up or not.   I am doing much better than I was in the beginning but it for sure sucked. He wasn't patient and I'm someone who can be too patient. It was a disaster waiting to happen. There was nothing wrong with him and I don't want to blame ADHD. I just hope that he finds the right person because I was not it and that sucks but whatever.   My advice to everyone dating someone who has ADHD. You both need to want to work for your relationship. It doesn't work if one person is trying to make it work and the other isn't that interested. Also read up on it. It helps a lot. Hope everyone is doing well and staying safe.

I've been married 6 years to a wonderful man(DX ADHD)He was formally diagnosed about a year ago but had troubles due to getting meds(no pharmacy had it for some reason) Basically had to go back every time and get re-diagnosed for a new script. Long story short, we now how a proper DX and meds.  We have 3 kids, two of which are special needs(one Sbs twin and a baby girl with Autism) I myself am most likely on the spectrum but I haven't gotten diagnoses yet. This is not super relevant but shows how hectic our lives are.  So now that we're getting in a better place both of us are making an effort into fixing the problems in our marriage. I'm also a special needs teacher so I've been doing a TON of research on ADHD and what I can do as a spouse to help.  Problem is, the research I am coming up with basically is just how a NT spouse can support their ND partner. Great but not so helpful for him supporting me.  We're going to get into counseling but are currently in the process of fixing broken cylinder heads on our only van. If any of you have done car work you can imagine how daunting lol. After crisis mode is over we will go to counseling.  What are some of the ways that you've found your partners support you? I'm wondering from NT and ND alike.   There is also some emotional damage done from past years(him to me) due to all this so I need to learn to forgive, forget and trust again but that's when I see a counselor myself.
b56a26089e8186b18deb234c9073e9fe881361b7683634381bba3a14e9083cb9;;;Does your ADD partner think no one hears them yet chronically interrupts?;;;Quick Q- I’m constantly having to hear my still untreated ADD partner rant about this after most social engagements, and it’s making me feel crazy. They say that they can never get a word in edgewise, that “everyone we know just wants to hear themselves talk”. Yet what I observe is that they don’t actually listen to anyone and jump in and interrupt constantly. And when they try to tell a story it goes on way too long, with no clear arc, and unnecessary sidetracks. Folks glaze over. For the record, we have great, highly emotional intelligent folks in our sphere. I don’t think they are overtaking the conversation.  I just avoid social situations with my partner now, and with COVID-19 it’s been easier to do. But when I take a risk and have one or two folks over I have to hear afterwards how victimized my partner feels over being unheard, and of course i walk on eggshells worried they are going to say something rude or thoughtless.   Anyone else have this issue? I hate how isolated and avoidant I am of being social now. It’s leading to depression, and yeah- I could go do stuff alone, and I do. But that feels even more depressing when I want a PARTNER in this life.

He was diagnosed with ADHD about a year and a half ago and is taking vyvanse for it. He’s also taking a sleep aid medication as well as an antidepressant.   I don’t know if it’s just the quarantine or if I am just crazy or something but I just...don’t feel like he loves me as much anymore. Some of you may have seen my comment in the weekly vent thread about hating his computer but at this point I don’t think it’s healthy for me to think about bashing his computer office space style.   I’ve been in this cycle with him for years now. He says we will contribute more to the house, does for about 2 days, forgets, tension builds tension builds tension builds, I break down and cry, he says he will do better and contribute more and the cycle just starts all over again.   Look, I’m not perfect either. I’m lazy and sometimes I don’t do shit in the house for a while either. But I always make sure that our bills are due on time, that the garbage goes out, the animals are fed, wake up for work on time. But for a lot of things, I have to ask him multiple times to do it. And his computer comes into play here because he’s always gaming. And wearing his cancelling headphones. We go to couples therapy and the topic of his computer and noise cancelling headphones has come up time and time again. He got speakers for his computer about a week ago now and he still hasn’t set it up.   I mentioned in my vent comment about how I go to sleep alone practically every night, our sex life is basically non existent. We know each other’s love languages and he never meets mine while I try my hardest to meet his. But idk maybe he does meet mine and I just don’t see it.   I’m trying to give him some grace here. He has been with me through some hard shit. I’ve lost a lot of friends these last few years to sudden deaths, overcoming my own trauma with my family and going to therapy for it, my previous job was really hard on me and made me sick and he’s been there through all of that. He says he doesn’t want to feel like I owe him for what he has done for me, and that it’s understandable that I have reached my boiling point. I feel like I need to tough through this and be there for him as much as I can but I just feel like we are so distanced from each other. Despite us working from home.   I’m starting to feel like I’m a fair weather wife. Like I’m suggesting a divorce or separation because I just can’t feel like his mother anymore. But I need to show more patience and better understand his ADHD and that none of the things he does, is an intentional act to hurt me but it still hurts. I just don’t even know what to do at this point anymore. I just don’t want to be in this cycle. What would you do?
2d99af632efc1596dfa740f7c9b2dd7ded46a3d229746d6768e3b041fb3325b5;;;tips for managing partners tendencies to talk excessively about hobbies?;;;Let me start out by saying I love my husband more than anything and he is my best friend. We’ve been together 3 years and married for 1, and I have always known that he has ADHD. He’s currently on medication and has been for years, but I’ve noticed that regardless if he takes his meds or not it still feels like he has trouble with excessive talking. This may not seem like a big deal, but it makes it very difficult for me to feel connected to him because I feel like he’s always dominating the conversation and when I do get to talk it feels like he is waiting for me to finish talking so that we can go back to talking about his hobbies rather than listen to what I have to say.  He loves cars and is also an engineer so his interest and work overlap-while this is great for him and I am so happy he’s following his passion, it’s often exhausting for me because I feel like all we talk about is cars. I’ve tried my best to take an interest in learning about different cars and supporting his hobby by going to auto cross with him and listening to his plans to modify his car or facts about cars we see on the road, but there always comes a certain point where I just feel like I have nothing to add to the conversation and I just keep saying “mhmm” until he notices that I am losing interest. Even after noticing that I’m not that into the conversation he will tend to keep going and sometimes it feels like he just wants someone to listen or to hear himself talk (but I could just be taking it personally). Bottom line, has anyone experienced anything similar with their partner or have any tips for how to communicate these feelings to my husband?
9b1a8a86f7d031e3c55299852fb403edcb53d9a6f9c338920854add5b9685651;;;Feel like mom, holding them accountable;;;I am not into sex with my partner (dx PI type) and I think a big reason is I feel like his mother. The other day he even said "okay mom" and I flipped out on him. If you don't want to be mothered then take responsibility for your life. He refuses to even try any organization methods because nothing works permanently. He's underemployed (special pandemic issues aside), so I am the breadwinner and the home manager and the initiator and I'm *tired.* I make lists. I try to get him to use smart home audio triggers. He will not take ownership over any of it. He's almost 40. He's on meds but I don't think he is taking them right. There's so many broken agreements and I could handle that ok but he's so defensive about it when I am asking him to be accountable. I don't care if you can't help it or not it's a betrayal of trust. You make it worse when you get defensive instead of taking responsibility. I have anxiety and it can make me a real chore but I'm still responsible for my anxious behavior even if it's "not intentional." I just want to feel like I'm married to a grown up but he literally sits around most of the day playing games either board or phone games, stays up late, cannot hold himself to a feeding schedule, will snack and not even ask our kid if he's hungry too, doesn't set an alarm to wake himself up, nods off when he's supposed to be parenting, don't get me started on the financial stuff.   I'm exhausted. I have no sexual desire for someone that is this stuck and irresponsible. He's responsible for finding strategies even if he is feeling like giving up if he wants the benefit of an adult relationship. Right?
f10cffe63f4b5c2709e1a151162165c64b83ad159ebcd192d64fd92cebdbbd2a;;;At what point is enough, enough?;;;I’ve been with my partner for almost five years now. When we met I immediately suspected ADHD. He’s insanely intelligent but dropped out of high school, university, could never apply himself along with other obvious traits. We went to a doctor who referred him to a psych who referred him to an ADHD clinic. The clinic, however, is very expensive so we’ve just been saving up for it in the meantime. He’s diagnosed but untreated at the moment.   I love him, and I want to support him as best I can but, as I’m sure you can all relate, living with someone with ADHD takes a toll on you.   There’s little things that just keep adding up after five years where I can’t take it anymore. And then I feel so guilty because I know it’s not his fault and he’s probably struggling with it more. How many times can I hear “I’m gonna do xyz tomorrow” when I know 10000% he will not. I want to snap and be like “We both know you won’t so don’t say tomorrow. Just say you’ll get to it” but I don’t want to be rude or discouraging but it’s so annoying being told day after day he’s going to do something when he won’t.   He’s been unemployed since December. He’s a hard worker but he’s not very good at finding jobs. I find I have to remind him almost daily to apply or else I just have to actually apply for him or he’ll sleep til five PM and then spend the rest of the day smoking weed or watching YouTube or playing Xbox. Now with this COVID finding a job is harder and I’m out of work so I’m really stressed financially and it’s hard not to snap at him when he sleeps until five and then doesn’t even help around the house. If I go to do the dishes it’s “I’m going to do those tonight, leave it” but then the next morning they’re still in the sink and repeat.   It’s not his fault and I know that but how much am I supposed to take before I’m allowed to snap? I feel as if I have a child not a partner. I have to ask him to pick up after himself and I have to wake him up when it’s four thirty in the afternoon and he’s still asleep. He goes to bed before me and sleeps hours in after me I don’t understand. Sorry if this feels whiny. I just have no where else to vent. If I tell any of my friends or family they’ll just call him lazy or a loser. No one understands ADHD.

My boyfriend is hard to be around on the weekends. I had plans to go to the beach today with a friend, partly to avoid him, but also because I have more social needs than my boyfriend can provide. My friend canceled the beach trip I was really looking forward to. And my boyfriend and I had a rough day (no surprises there). My boyfriend was angry at himself throughout the day, because he couldn't relax. When I wasn't feeling completely ignored, I felt like I was being picked on. I told my boyfriend I was leaving, and that I really needed some social interaction today. When I came back home I was still feeling bad and was tearful. My boyfriend realized and said he was going to stay with me and give me attention. I was so relieved he was able to figure this out. I know I said it in plain English, but even that does not work sometimes. He comforted me for a bit, but it was not long before he began crying and saying he's been feeling depressed lately. So I comforted him, and my feelings were second to his again (and again and again). Later we went out to eat, and we came back home. My boyfriend was breathing very shallow, I asked if he felt okay and that he was breathing shallow. He immediately took it as a criticism, and said I was making him self conscious. Now he's having an RSD reaction to a mild concern I voiced. I'm feeling like I'm at the end of my rope. I cannot do and say everything right. I'm so tired of having to be the voice of optimism and positive affirmation all the time, while my boyfriend is critical, angry, and grumpy.

Emotions run high in conflicts with our loved ones and it is all too easy to play the blame game and lash out at our partners.   &#x200B;  [As many of us have come to realize - often it's not what you say to your ADHD partner, rather how you say it](https://preview.redd.it/pj7gfnuu2tm31.png?width=1318&format=png&auto=webp&s=63a9d1a466ff1851e255eee2039730b344fa6f4b)  Practicing mindfulness and other DBT skills can improve communication for all parties involved
17401dbdeab5a6c7cee6c58fda6edd6916d7c7447ba74b5ed710a1ccd1f1847c;;;Does your ADHD partner lack common sense?;;;Spouse is diagnoses and medicated.  I'm trying to figure out if this is common to having ADHD or it's just my guy. He's wonderful and the greatest person I know but there are times when I cannot figure out what he's thinking when he makes certain choices. I know that ADHD messes with the need to do things immediately so if I ask him to do something, he'll literally put down what he's doing right then and go do it (not because he wants to do something for me but because I think it interrupts the "I must do this now" and replaces it with "I must do THIS now").   For example: Our vet recently told us to start our dog on different food and then gave us samples while they ordered a case for us to pick up. Before I realized he'd done it, the samples were gone but he hadn't picked the new food up, so the dog is about to be flipped back to the old food in the meantime because he didn't wait to start the new food where we could continue it. There are endless stories about this. Taking multiple trips to do something when one loaded up trip would do. Taking roundabout ways to go somewhere instead of the obvious straight line, etc. I'm forever trying to understand how his brain works so I can help him not make things harder on himself, but I'm not in his head and can't teach him how to think.  Do you and your ADHD partner struggle with this too, or does this have nothing to do with ADHD?
d82d37504bd4aef313c6368694ee72f6324ecd28de853e74bd77f9521e596821;;;Is it ok for me to join this group?;;;My ex and I separated a year a half ago. We have a child with medical a developmental diagnoses. I take care of our child full time. My ex knows how to take care of our child, medical equipment and all, but appears very anxious whenever he has had his parenting time. We had a bad time together after we got married and I stayed as long as I could. I’m primarily looking for a place where I can learn more and maybe pick up some new tools that will help with communication between us going forward. I found some things that work. Talking in person, unless I know exactly what and how I want to say something has been very difficult and it’s easy to feel like I’m having a completely different conversation than he seems to be having? Is it ok to join this group? If not, does anyone know of another group for me?
913be67a7d9adc527abc54454a72429bdb7fde307da24e25ae3fa299093e580c;;;I don't know how I can keep on like this;;; I've just had an incredibly rough two weeks, having to leave my job due to some very shady shit and then finding out a chronic illness I thought I had finally gotten under control is definitely not - in the process having to be hospitalized for the worst pain I have ever experienced. I had major life-altering surgery for this 6 months ago that I still haven't fully processed, and there is literally nothing left that can be done... If it doesn't resolve itself (which sadly is unlikely) I face longterm pain and disability.    Now, my DXed, non-medicated husband is passive-aggressively sniping and countering everything I say, laughing at me, and just showing outright animosity.  Oh, and it's my fault he's behaving this way. Cause he's stressed, too, but doesn't want to share what he's stressed out about. Because he had to witness me in pain and couldn't fix it, and so he feels useless. Because I ask for attention.   Apparently asking to be held, to be cuddled, or to be touched INVALIDATES those actions he may have actually been about to do, because now they don't seem motivated by him. And since that's how he thinks, that MUST be how I think, as that is all he has to go on... Oh, except for the fact that I have said outright that I DON'T think that way. But it doesn't matter what I've told him - his way of interpreting things is the only way.   Right now I feel like he doesn't even like me, let alone love me. I feel like I'm making his life worse just being here. I feel like he's miserable because of me and me alone. I'm at the point where I can't express anything anymore. I'm either wrong in what I feel, or what I'm asking for, or what I'm seeing. I can't seem to get anything right. I'm just an inconvenience to him. But then he'll flip and suddenly I'm the most amazing woman who he can't believe graces him with my presence. Who he adores with all his heart and would do anything for.   I can't take the flipping, the assumptions, and the passive-aggressiveness anymore. I don't know what to do.
eeb28044656cced85d793cd49ea3c341f89a73db26bddd91d5f0d82d8f0b2f49;;;Having a hard time moving past the hurt this morning;;;My fiancé (DX, unmediated) and I have really, really struggled to get through the last year - it’s been brutal. We love each other so much and thankfully haven’t really had any relationship problems, but we’ve been living with severe mental illness (we both have anxiety and depression, and he has ADHD) and are really feeling the weight of it after a year of trying to survive a pandemic and having no one else to lean on.   Things have been especially rough for my fiancé; we lost his beloved grandma to brain cancer last year and he’s understandably still grieving. He also suddenly lost his job a few months before she died, which sent him into a severe depression that he’s just now kind of climbing out of. The COVID pandemic hit right as all of this was happening, and we’ve been quarantined in our small apartment for a whole year now. After many months of sending out resumes and becoming increasingly discouraged, he finally got a new job (he hasn’t started working yet, but it’s a huge relief that he got the gig).  I’m really proud of him for still being here and fighting to make it through each day. He’s spent the last year digging deep and analyzing how his unmedicated ADHD has impacted his decisions and his life. I’ve learned so much about how his brain works and I’m glad that he’s had the time and space to process a lot of his trauma and talk about it.  But I’m also feeling, exhausted, empty, and pretty hurt by something he said to me last night. We don’t usually do anything big for Valentine’s Day - about the most we’ve ever done is get a heart-shaped pizza and watch a silly movie. So I didn’t really have any expectations yesterday, I just wanted to relax and spend some time with him in the evening after I was done with my work.  Unfortunately, he got sucked into a dramatic Facebook fight and hyper-focused on it for basically the whole evening, getting really sad and angry about it. By 3 am, my fiancé was having a crisis in the bathroom, crying and talking about how much he regretted some of his life choices and how hard life has been for him in general. It made my heart break and I tried to just listen and comfort him, but there wasn’t much I could do. That’s when he said something to the effect of, “I try to keep in mind that we wouldn’t be together if I had taken a different path. But, no offense, if someone offered me a choice between this life and an easier one where I never met you, I’d choose the easier life.”  And that just completely tanked my already awful mood. It made me feel sort of powerless and insignificant. I didn’t say anything because I could tell he was kinda processing things out loud and honestly, I understand where he was coming from. Living with mental illness is so incredibly hard, and if he was able to wave a magic wand and get an easier life where he wouldn’t have to experience so many hardships, I wouldn’t blame him for waving it.  But it still hurt to hear. I just wanted to have an uneventful Valentine’s Day where we could eat some cookies and watch TV. Not to be told by my fiancé that he’d choose a different, easier life without me over one with me if he could. Thankfully, he noticed the change in my mood pretty quickly and apologized when I expressed my hurt. I can’t stop thinking about what he said though.  I’ve been crying basically all night and wasn’t able to fall asleep because of it. And I hate that I’m still awake and wallowing in pain over it when he immediately apologized and said he shouldn’t have said something like that. I think I’m actually hurting more for him than for myself. I hate seeing him suffer like this and I wish I could make life easier for him. I do everything I can, but he really carries the weight of the world on his shoulders and I often feel like there’s absolutely nothing I can do but listen to him and hold his hand.  I know he’s gonna wake up today and feel awful, and I’ll try to do everything I can to make the day bearable. But damn, I’m so incredibly tired and just the thought of having to drag myself through this day is making me exhausted.  If you’ve read all of this, thank you! I just needed to get this off my chest so maybe I can get out of this sadness spiral and go to sleep.
adf622fc83b4aa8f393627f99d9a6f73fe8e65c96f379f7bc1e6249c708b786b;;;Does your adhders do this?;;;So my husband (40 adhd non medicated) does this thing. So he will largely be ok-ish and then it seems I can feel a tension building. Like a tidlewave gaining momentum and size. It'll start simple like not talking to me, then it'll be snippy statements when I ask him to do something. Then, everytime, I'll get the "why are you so negative? I cant ever do anything right to you."  Followed by a few days of passive aggressive pouting. Then the wave makes landfall. Almost anything can set it off. This time I asked if he had cleaned the litter pan. But it wasn't that I had asked, it was "how" I asked. This results in the same situation no matter the trigger: an hour or two of hime telling me how lazy,filthy, and otherwise insufferable I am. And then a side order of how sad I make him and I always tear him down and why cant I be happy? But once he gets it all out I'll ha e a week or two of semi normalcy, or as normal as he will ever be.   Anyone else deal with this?

How do you deal with self sabotage, especially when it ends up impacting both people in the relationship? I have tried- unsuccessfully- to help my spouse in a few different situations to avoid outcomes that would be detrimental both to her individually and to us as a couple. My efforts to help are rebuffed, she doesn’t do what she needs to do to avert crisis even when she has verbalized ahead of time what the consequences could be, and then inevitably ends up in a crisis situation that is ultimately of her own doing. This cycle is maddening. I end up having to rescue her because the situations she gets in impact us both. Then I’m told, more or less, that she doesn’t mean to put me in this situation and she’s not asking me to rescue her, which feels both untrue and extremely naive. I can’t stand living like this, floating from crisis to crisis, because she won’t take care of herself. I feel like I’m always waiting for the other shoe to drop. It also feels really hard for me to be a shoulder to cry on for her when the shit hits the fan, after she’s expressed worry that would happen, I’ve offered solutions, she has rejected the solutions and doesn’t come up with any of her own, and then gets sad when the shit actually does hit the fan.

Even if it won't ultimately change the situation, that sort of effort at empathy would go a long way for me. And yet my partners default is to blame shift, dent, minimize, try to fact check me to prove my foundational position wrong (which he thinks means I am then also wrong to be upset), etc. If I can push my way through all of that, I get a non-apology apology or a lip service apology with no teeth to it. No remorse. No ping of genuine rapport. It's like he is robotically imitating what apologetic words should sound like but it is entirely divorced from the emotion that you expect to be expressed with an apology. And when I try to bring this up he just gets mad and says "sorry I didn't hold my mouth right when I said it" but like, there's an actual difference between empty words and a heartfelt apology and just... Why is it so hard for him?  I am sure toxic shame is a factor, but I can't sustainably tolerate all the adhd related stress and then also just put up with him being crappy the few times I try to address it with him. I need some strategies to teach him how to communicate the language of apology or understanding that I crave in these situations.   When I don't get what I need emotionally in these situations it leads to dysfunctional communication on both sides, where I stop trying so hard to be kind about his symptoms, almost rubbing his failures in his face because he is denying and minimizing these issues and that leaves me feeling very unheard so I start providing more examples of whatever I'm frustrated about (this last one was task management problems).    I don't like this dynamic. I'd rather bring the issue up in a compassionate, assertive manner, feel heard, feel respected, and have some emotional labor done on my behalf to balance the labor I do administratively, managerially, conversationally and emotionally on a continual basis. But that isn't happening. He gets defensive etc instead and usually picks a fight with me (which he then says was my fault). I also can't just give up on what I need from him either. I am accommodating xyz and looking past abc, so I need one or two changes from him also.   So, have you found a way to effectively get your partner to understand the impact of their behavior on you and to proactively offer some kind of understanding or even apology? I'm really tired of this.   Side note: We have done couples counseling four different times (including with ADHD aware providers) and he doesn't ever remember to practice the homework so I don't think it will help this issue.

The tree has been pulled away from the wall to “decorate” more. There are clothes and shoes of his all over. Things that need to be cleaned all over the kitchen counter. He is off work for a few weeks for the holidays. I  (NT) am still working full time from home and trying to wrap up end of year paperwork. This morning his standard line “I want to be so productive, but I just don’t know what to do...” came out. I gotta tell you, I nearly lost it. I didn’t address it then, and now that I’m calm - he’s found something to do - video games. Ughhhhh. Is it just me? Am I the only one? How does everyone handle this?
d2f7a8ec81f7668bd0728b43d83f6a5c03e7f4fb252c8b4c851c067fdb2fff0c;;;Marriage help;;;My partner(diagnosed ADHD, 41 yrs old) and I (non-ADHD, 31 yrs old) have been having problems since the start of our relationship 10 years ago. Things became more complicated and difficult with time, marriage, and having 2 kids. I did not realize that he might have ADHD until we were married and he never revealed this either. I always thought he was the quirky, fun guy who was a little different. Anyway, now 2 kids in, years of therapy both individually and together, I do not know if I can live with his ADHD for the rest of my life. I love him as a person but have so many emotions towards him as a partner and I do not know if therapy can help me. The more I try to read about ADHD, understand it and him, the more I question whether this is something I can accept and live with. I have to mention that he is overall a wonderful, loving husband and dad. He is there for my in bigger picture type of ways. Maybe my expectations for a partner are too high in my mind and they don't match my reality? I know everyone has their good and bad qualities so maybe I am living in a fantasy world. I can't unsee all of his faults and this affects our relationship in every way. I have become more understanding of the fact that he cannot control or change many things about himself.   However, this really leaves me to question whether I can deal with this for the rest of my life. I am not attracted to him, have no sex drive, and spending time with him makes me anxious as we tend to bicker and fight if I point things out to him. This leaves me with the feeling of disappointment and sadness.  It is a continuous spiral and I feel like he is my 3rd child and not my partner. Am I being selfish? Has anyone else had these feelings?
910341cecba3b2ee3211da0eb844231dc0668f3d7f95f3a31e1d47ed9c5dcb5d;;;I Wish I had a success story to tell;;;During our entire 5.5 year relationship my girlfriend had undiagnosed ADHD until she was finally diagnosed a few months before it ended. I mentioned in passing a few different times that I think she might have ADHD after certain events but no actions were taken. I’m not resentful for that, but knowing ADHD was in the picture would have made all the difference. I would have been able to separate you from the symptoms… You didn’t lock us out all those times, your ADHD did. You didn’t mean to interrupt me when I was sharing something important, your ADHD did. You didn’t forget important things I told you, your ADHD did.  Our relationship started off rocky. There were a lot of intense fights but we persevered for so long and made so many memories together, good and bad. I think those early conflicts still did their damage and we never fully recover from them. I think your ADHD symptoms were more uncontrolled at the start. How could someone get so angry so quickly, yell at me at the top of their lungs and be over it so soon? Did I screw up that badly? Was it worth that huge fight or was it just ADHD and emotional dysregulation? I always tried to communicate you had a temper that was hurtful to me. I voiced that it would be more productive if you communicated issues you had in a serious tone so we can work together on it, rather than go straight to yelling at me. I know you tried that sometimes with me being unreceptive. I’m sorry.  I communicated my complaints such as your messy room multiple times and you said you'd get to it and improve. I took your word for it the first few times and believed you. Days turned into weeks and you never really got to it. When I'd bring it up again I was "nagging" and I’m sure I was but it hurt when I took your word only for there to be inaction. It felt like I was being lied to. Eventually, you became defensive and said the room wasn't messy even though others complained about it to me, unsolicited. You eventually went on the attack and said I wasn't organized myself either. I offered to help but you always rejected it. I'm sorry I became way too controlling. I felt like a parent, not a partner.  How should I have avoided being naggy when I take your word only for there to be no results?  I tried really, really hard to believe you every time you recalled something said or occurred as evidence during an argument we had. You forgot things I told you, but during an argument, you're 100% sure of critical events or things said. I tried to believe you and think I did 99% of the time, but credibility plays into the picture. Unfortunately, when you typically forget things or not follow through on your words, its hard for me to not see your credibility as damaged.   There was crying from you during every single argument. Sometimes understandably so, but other times over the smallest of things. For example, I tried to be open and honest by communicating things that bothered me in a level headed approach but even some of those attempts lead to tears. You said you didn’t mean to cry but how was I suppose to be able to feel free to communicate things with you and work as a team when so many non confrontational attempts led to tears. Crying during every argument eventually had a boy who cried wolf effect. Unfortunately, I think I became numb to it at times.  Understandably, you turned to your friends to vent and get advice when we had issues. I can’t help but feel like my perspective wasn't adequately voiced. How could you tell an unbiased story when we were already at a disagreement to begin with and everything your friends hear is coming from you. They don’t know the entire story of what we’ve gone through in our relationship and past trauma that might be exposed in this fight. They’re also your friends and I can’t help be think already on your side to begin with. I got along with most of your friends but knowing that one did not like me when I barely had interactions with her made it obvious she didn’t like me from things you were sharing with her. Maybe if she fully knew my perspective it would’ve helped her get a better understanding of what I was feeling. But I still acknowledge I was horrible at times. I’ve read that bad mouthing your partner to your friends and family is the silent killer of relationships. I agree.    I was not the greatest partner. I was angry, failed to show how much I loved and cared for you. Admittedly, sometimes my love got lost in middle of all the chaos, but it always found its way back. I became something I am not proud of and I am so sorry for some of the things I said and did. I never want to become that again. I should have treated you better. It was just so hard at times through some of the chaos of our relationship. When things finally seemed to go well and we were both improving and happy, something negative would occur and a fight would ensue.  I just wanted an amazing and happy relationship with you but I guess that won’t happen now. You’ve grown so much better and unknowingly managed your ADHD symptoms when you weren’t even diagnosed and I’m so proud of you for that. Often I didn’t understand you and we just couldn’t seem to see eye to eye. Knowing you had ADHD would have changed all of that. In an effort to become a better partner, I spent hours and hours researching and reading books about ADHD as well as its symptoms. Looking back, I can see clearly it was the cause for so many issues we had and it would have been amazing to move forward with this knowledge in hand and improve our relationship, together. It breaks my heart that’s not an option anymore. I've learned that diagnosis is the first step in improving an ADHD relationship, but as soon as we made that first step you wanted to end our relationship.   You were dealt cards that have some positives but also some negatives. It isn’t fair you have to go through life with those negatives and feel like you’re not good enough. You are stronger than so many people, myself included, for facing ADHD. I love you and I’m sorry for things I did. It’s a shame this didn’t work out. It’s been killing me everyday. If you’ve moved on already I am happy for you, but in the smallest chance you haven’t, I hope you find comfort in knowing that I’m in so much pain. Even though we are not a couple anymore we are still going through this horrible process together.   If you think you or your partner has ADHD, please get tested immediately. The knowledge alone will be eye opening and you two to finally begin to understand each other.
d406f91d5d61b36a44bc991acc621e0519f9d730e3b43cf81a8f3ce41f532edc;;;He yell-ranted at me again and threw things. RSD is massive some days, I dont know what to do anymore.;;;My partner is a 29 year old male, with adhd, depression and weed addiction. He hasnt smoked for two weeks and have begun to get help from a professional with the addiction.   I dont know if its rsd, adhd or the weed addiction - or a mix of it all.   Some days there are no problem. We like to joke around and tease eachother lovingly. On his off days this is not at all possible because everything feels like an attack. Problem is I dont always know when he has an off day because he doesnt tell me.  Sometimes he is clearly annoyed and angry, but from experience it sets him off to ask if he is okay.  Ive tried in any way I can think of to approch it but it doesnt matter what I say or how I ask, it always ends up with him exploding. With time Ive lost my patience, and sometimes ask him why he is so angry, which is counterproductive because this makes him slam doors etc.  I then tell him I dont want to talk when its like that, but it seems like he cant stop when he is already going. He yells sometimes for hours. He accuses me of not listening while having these onesided screaming matches "with me" as he has no interest in letting me speak. He then begin to bring out things, out of context, from old fights and it becomes  just hours of him yelling about everything Ive ever done wrong. For the most part I dont even know how to respond when he takes some out of context and applied it differently.   Eventually I will get up and go. I have told him that if he yells I will leave because it triggers my anxiety attacks, and its made me had anxiety attacks in the past. Sometimes he trashes the room and throw with things when Im there. Today I could hear he trashed his apartment after I went out the door.   I have tried to ask him if he can give me a heads up when he has an off day, because then I know to be careful of what to say on those days, but he feels like I just have to guess and then wait it off. Ive told him how uncomfortable those days feels for me as it feels like Im in a minefield, and he's just waiting for me to take a wrong step so he has an excuse for his anger outlet.   I dont understand he cant meet me just a bit halfway here. I dont want to upset him, both because of his feelings but also to protect myself.   These tantrums scares me. He has never put a hand on me, but he has tried to flip the bed in the night while I was in it. He excused it after by saying I shouldnt be afraid, because it was just the bed he was hitting.   At the 6 months Ive known him Ive seen him break a tv, a doorknob, a sign in the middle of the street, thrown a bike, thrown his computer.   I told him its not normal and he needs to talk to someone about his anger. He says outward aggression is normal, and he wish I would do the same when Im angry, which just makes me feel like he is completely in denial.  I come from a childhood home with yelling, aggression and anger. When he does this it triggers the hell out of me and takes me week to feel sort of normal again. I close off immediatly after and tell him my boundaries has been crossed and that I need time to get back on my own feet (so it doesnt effect my school which it tends to do as I sometimes get too sad to leave my house the following days).  My partner has anger and aggression issues and clearly also rsd that inflates on some days. He is also warm, empathetic and loving. Its two different people to me. I love the one side but the other side scares me. I want him to get better, but I also feel like I need to take a step back to protect myself. I also dont want to keep being his therapist, and Im beginning to see my own mental health slipping. Ive become gradually more annoyed and shorttempered myself, and Im selfisolating more. Ive said mean things back to him after period of times where Ive had enough. He doesnt think its mean when he tells me things like that "because thats his opinion". Eventually I snap back. Im feeling extremely stressed by the situation.  Its come to the point where Im not comfortable having him in my apartment anymore, if he yells or throw things here aswell, and Im always trying to avoid his neighbours because its just embarassing. He yells out extremely intimate things I dont share with everyone while turning them into disorted things they are not. How am I supposed to trust someone like that. Yelling out how I called him dumb today that one time when I snapped after months of him talking down about everything I was learning in school. Correcting me though we study different fields. Mansplaining my whole assigment (that i was proud of  aswell as the feedback from our teachers) back to me. I have told him after many times that I dont think he is dumb and I said it in a pety moment of wanting to get back at him.   He tells me I belittles him, and I guess i do in those moments. He has been belittlening me from the day we met. From how I dated when me met (though he lied about who he was), he has shamed me for my sexual past and called me disgusting amongst other thing. He was a virgin when we met (which he lied about. I didnt know). He has called me talking about my life for drama yet its not when he talks about conflicts, family, friends. He has told me Im lazy and have no passion, yet I have school and work. He hasnt gone to school since it started in august and he never does anything. He calls me a mess, yet Im pretty sure Im the only one who has cleaned his bathroom in all the time Ive known him.  I know he is projecting. I told him that but now he tells me Im projecting (this was the same mirroring thing my narcissistic ex did). He makes me feel like the worst for snapping back, and denies his role in it. What does he expect?  I know Im not innocent in this for saying mean things back. I end up feeling so run over and emotionally neglected that I cant controle it either. I want him to feel how it feels in that moment (where I myself act like a teenager).  Im still in some sort of chock from the last time some hours ago and really upset, so Im sorry if this text is a bit all over the place.  Is there any advice? Have any of you experienced the same? How can I handle this without ending it?

So here's my vent, and it's a tiny one! But so frustrating! When my ADHD spouse goes to the store, I can't text him to ask him to get something I think of that I know we need there. It leads to overwhelm. I recently asked him to look for nondairy yogurt and it took him 20 minutes to find it and then totally lost it with me over this. This drives me crazy. I hate inefficiency. End of vent. :)
58df7ddc093d97e52d424ba3dfb6e4306fa916689ffd058d8c5c9b662b64b674;;;ADHD and Empathy;;;I was wondering if there was a link between the two, if lack of empathy or difficulty putting yourself in another’s shoes is a symptom of ADHD. I fully recognize that it’s likely just another quirk of my husbands but I have long wondered how many of my husbands separate issues are due to his ADHD. (Like his lack of brain to mouth filter and financial irresponsibilities).  To be clear, he does understand that other people have feelings and all that. He’s not a psychopath. He just can’t seem to understand why people feel things when it is not something that he himself feels.   The best example i have is a couple years ago a tree fell onto my dads boat which was being stored for the winter. We got a video from my mom showing the damage and you could hear my dad yelling and swearing in the background. My husband turned to me and asked why my dad was so angry. I admit I thought he was joking.  Me: “A tree just broke his boat, of course he’s angry”  Husband “But it’s just a tree, it’s an act of god. It’s not like someone cut the tree to make it fall this way. I don’t understand why he’s angry.”  And he genuinely didn’t get it. So I asked him how he would feel if we had an earthquake and his super heavy tool kit fell from the trunk it’s on and landed on his violin case, crushing the instrument inside. It’s an act of god, no one broke your violin. How would you feel?  It was like a light went off in his head and he nodded and said “I’d be really pissed off, ok I think I get it. “  So he can empathize with people but only if it’s something that he himself has experienced. I just don’t know if this is a part of his ADHD and can be worked on with therapy or if it’s a part of who he is.   I’m really interested to hear if anyone else has a partner with similar issues and advice on how to work with it. I’m a very empathetic person and it’s very difficult communicating with him sometimes.

If he wants to do something that I have set boundaries around, there's always some justification or excuse for why he did the thing anyways. When asked, he says he thinks about my perspective, but he "didnt think it would be harmful" and "I didn't mean to hurt you." Which I completely believe, I dont think it's gaslighting at all, but if I try to generalize this as an issue I'm told I need to think more about the details and reasons why he does things and that it isn't indicative of a slippery slope for distrustful behavior. I have pretty bad anxiety this is making it worse. I know impulse control and adhd can go pretty hand in hand, but I don't know how to handle this because the upset and frustration is growing on my end. How do you handle impulse control? Or breakdowns on trust and boundaries as a result thereof? I love him and want to make this work but I'm really struggling

But with his chronic unemployment and lack of help with chores/household stuff I'm worried its not the right decision. I love him like crazy.  Also edited to add - he wants to change, and is in CBT and taking meds, but we've seen very little improvement in 2+ years.   I'm asking those of you with all of the kids/house/etc responsibilities: If you could go back in time, would you have stayed with your partner, but not have children?  Do you regret having kids with your partner?  Do you wish you had cut and run?

I've  been dealing with all his flaws like forgetfulness, lack of awareness, focus, lack of motivation, emotions, empathy, and so on and it is extremely tiring.  Something happened the other day and it sort of pushed me to the edge and I'm depressed now.    We went to a beach for a walk.  It was a hot sunny day and the place was packed.  At the time, my city had a policy where you have to either wear face coverings or keep social distancing.  It was so packed that in some area, it was almost impossible to keep the distance and I was shocked to see so many people without face coverings.  We had masks of course and we were walking along the shoreline.  At one point we were passing by a family sitting down on the beach without masks and somehow their teenage kid got really close to me.  Her mom, instead of telling the kid to keep distance, told me to stay away and then followed by a nasty comment by the teenage kid.  I was in shock and couldn't comprehend what had happened and by the time I figured it out we had already walked passed them.  I didn't deserve the nasty comments from the family and it completely ruined my mood.  I didn't want to go home like that so on the way to the car, we sat on a bench in a park that overlooks the ocean.   My husband didn't say anything  at all about the event and was watching youtube on this phone.    I just thought that he was being extremely insensitive.   I don't expect him to notice small stuff, but this?  I was expecting him to at least say 'Are you okay'?   What's the point of having a life partner who doesn't care of your well being?  or doesn't protect you from harmful situation?  How does he not know what happened to me when he was walking right by me?    The thing is this wasn't the first time something like this happened.  We were at the same spot at the same time but he was completely clueless as to what happened to me as his mind was busy with something else.    After the beach incident, I became very depressed and became distant, but he still has no clue and avoiding me.  He is probably thinking that I'm mad at him but I'm just really depressed and desperately wanting to see he cares.  I'm just really tired of initiating conversation as that's what I have been doing for the last 10 years we've been together.    Do you have an episode like this with your ADHD partner?   Do I just have to continue to accept his behavior if we want to stay together?

Our marriage has been in decline since we got married 5 years ago and when he agreed to try medication I was really hoping that all the pieces would fall into place.  He would be able to see when I was sick or sad. He would be able to think more than a day into the future and could save $$ for retirement and house repairs instead of spending everything and expecting me to save for all the un-fun things. I hoped he would start doing things around the house instead of looking at his phone 12 hours a day. Maybe he wouldn't talk over me every time I speak. We could plan a vacation together without him poo-pooing every decision every step of the way. We would be able to plan for ... anything.   But...yeah, I wouldn't be writing this if the fairy tail came true...The meds didn't have the impact and now he refuses to go back to the doc and ask for advice or try something different. He had stimulants as a child and refuses to even consider that meds/knowledge have changed in the last 30 years, so he tried a non-stimulant. I only had one shot, and it passed.  And so both of our worlds continue to rest on my shoulders. And no matter how seriously I tell him that our marriage is on the verge of ending, he does not comprehend it. (This wasn't a meds or else situation, more of a maybe meds can save us situation.)  I don't really have a direct question for everyone, just venting.  But I'd appreciate it if anyone can relate so I don't feel so alone.
87f4fb7085afeb08689503f1a14f3262bcc27ac25ecaa550d5946aa0f14e8841;;;Some books I’ve come across recently that are helping my ADHD partner and I;;;My partner (23M) was diagnosed with ADHD about a year ago and is currently working on finding medication that works for him. The diagnosis has explained a lot about his ‘quirks’, but we’re struggling a fair bit with navigating the difficulties that ADHD symptoms can bring to a relationship. I recently found The Couples Guide to Thriving with ADHD by Melissa Orlov and Nancie Kohlenberger. Melissa’s husband has ADHD, and Nancie and her husband both have ADHD, and they talk a lot about what it’s like to be part of an ADHD effected relationship. They offer so much insight and a lot of different tactics for tackling ‘hot spots’.   I’ve felt SO seen and since I started reading this book and have started reading it aloud to my partner, pausing for discussions about how the subject matter relates to what we’re going through. It’s given me a lot of perspective and understanding I didn’t have previously and has  me realize what actions I have adopted to try to help things, that are actually harmful overall, like ‘parenting behavior’.   I really highly recommend it, it’s a fantastic resource.
f27b259475eb23d61a939dd30efe7d8b8ed58f56d98a585962d3e4e974de6d82;;;Not sure where to begin...;;;Wife DX.  Let me start by saying that I am 29(M), my wife is 30(F). We have been married 9 years, and have 2 daughters, ages 8 & 1. My wife was diagnosed with ADHD by a licensed psychiatrist early 2019.   We met when we were both 18, began a relationship, and almost instantly she started talking about marriage. Both of our families are part of a very fundamentalist subculture of Christianity(large families/anti birth control, homeschooling, etc.) so the idea of getting married young & quickly was encouraged by both our parents, and did not seem odd in the social circles we were part of. Two of my older siblings had done the same, so we forged ahead.  Our relationship began in August 2009, and our wedding was March 2010. Nearly as quickly as she had started marriage talk at the beginning of our relationship, now she wanted to talk about having children. I now understand that her desire to leap into these big decisions so quickly is probably caused by impulsivity due to her ADHD...  Other odd things began to crop up in our relationship. One day I returned home from work to discover she had adopted a kitten, without talking to me, our landlord, anyone. I had made it clear to her from the beginning that I have allergies that would prevent us from EVER having an indoor pet, but I was just met with an endless string of rationalizations:  "It was just so cute!","Your sister was with me and she egged me on","What if I wash it with special hypoallergenic shampoo everyday?" etc.  Try as I might, I couldn't get her to see that I was hurt by her making a big decision without considering me at all. It seemed as if the decision tree in her brain had only 2 paths:   Is it fun/exciting/novel/easy? --> Do it!  Is it boring/tedious/difficult? --> Don't do it!  Things like this led to A LOT confusion and resentment on my part, but I felt like my time was increasingly spent making sure things in life didn't fall apart. And when I did express to her, "Hey babe, it seems as if you are only interested in having fun for yourself & I feel like you don't think about how things effect me" an enormous fight would ensure("WHY DO YOU HATE FUN?!" "YOU ALWAYS RUIN EVERYTHING" etc.)  We had our first child the year after we were married(turns out the rhythm method isn't super reliable), and she immediately wanted another, so our first born wouldn't be lonely. It was quite taxing on me, both emotionally and financially, when we had our first child as I was the only one working and we were totally unprepared. I tried to communicate to her the level of stress I felt, and how unprepared I felt we were for one child, let alone another(I wanted to save for a house downpayment and emergency fund). She responded by lashing out numerous times at how "materialistic" I was.   This was the cycle that continued for the next 4-5 years. My income increased over this time, but our financial disagreements did as well. We would sit down in front of a spreadsheet or with pen and paper, and I would walk her through each category in our budget giving her the chance to make changes as she thought were necessary. We would tweak the budget until we both were happy, I would confirm with her that she agreed to this budget, and she would go right back to life as usual as if we had never talked.  "I just forget" is the stock response when I would ask her why she couldn't stick to her word.  My wife became pregnant on two other occasions. One in 2016 unfortunately led to a miscarriage at the end of the first trimester. Her third pregnancy in 2018 led to a healthy girl who just turned 1. She has now told me she is done having children.   We started to suspect ADHD in mid-to-late 2018, when my wife made a comment to me about how her mind seems to be always jumping from only thing to the next. She said its quite difficult for her to focus on one thing clearly unless its very novel/exciting/etc. I made an offhand comment along the lines of "Have you ever though that maybe you have ADHD?" She said its possible and told me her only brother was diagnosed with ADHD(by a psychologist) in middle school, but her parents flat-out said "Nope, he just has a lot of energy".  So I started googling, and each run-down of ADHD symptoms I found fit her to a tee(aside from an inability to sit still). She took a few informal online tests that indicated she exhibits quite a few ADHD symptoms. So she made herself an appointment with a psychiatrist for an ADHD evaluation. This psychiatrists diagnosis was "You show almost every symptom of ADHD, but I'm not sure you have it". This left my wife disheartened and angry(rightfully so, I think), so she let the issue lie for a while. After our second child was born, my wife met with a different psychiatrist for an evaluation, and received a positive ADHD diagnosis in early-to-mid 2019 .   This is where things stand right now. She cannot start taking stimulant medication as she is still breastfeeding our youngest.  She also has looked into ADHD coaching as a possible solution, but it is expensive...  &#x200B;  I am just looking for a ray of hope because I feel so utterly burned out in our relationship. When I look back over the past 9 years I mostly see myself scrambling and reacting to whatever she decides she wants that at that moment. I have my own responsibilities in life, and I try my best to stay on top of those, while also trying to catch her stuff that falls through the cracks because she though it was boring or "forgot". I feel like I cannot depend on her to keep her word, and its sometimes easier to do everything yourself than try to rely on someone who is by their own admission chronically unreliable. Her emotions must always take center stage, and when I venture to express how I'm feeling, her reaction to what I said immediately becomes more important. I have a hard time putting in to words how bitter I am about this giant relational imbalance in the validity of each of our feelings.   It is possible that I have dug my own grave by not setting healthy boundaries with her, but setting a boundary seems to involve telling someone "I do not like what you are doing right now". How is it possible to do that when your ADHD partner takes even the slightest hint of criticism as a outright personal attack? Each time I have tried to set boundary with her a DEFCON level 5 argument is the result, because she feels attacked. And double standards run rife in our relationship... What I have been able to gather is if she is angry/tired/stressed/hungry the Golden Rule is off the table.   I frequently fantasize about having an emotional affair, about being with someone who wants me to feel cared for. I know that's wrong, but isn't feeling cared for the basic fundamental need a long-term intimate relationship is supposed to fulfill? My wife swears up & down that she cares about and deeply loves me, she just can't help herself from doing these inconsiderate things that I "interpret as unloving". Basically, if I don't feel loved, its MY problem.  I've read Gina Peras book. I've read Melissa Orlovs book. I scour the web and read articles from ADDitute magazine and VeryWellMind. But no matter how much I read I cannot understand how to make a relationship work when half seems incapable of putting their partner or the relationship ahead of having fun/being entertained/stimulated. Isn't that a fundamental part of a healthy relationship?  Does this all magically go away with medication? I apologize if this would be classified as a "rant" and therefore in the wrong place... I truly feel at the end of my rope, what keeps me going is not wanting my kids to grow up in a broken home.

Not for him. He knows there's a problem. He knows its destroying our marriage. He cries and pleads. I've sent him articles, online quizzes, discussed, screamed, cried, begged, made his appointments, got him on meds, do everything...washing, cooking, cleaning, paying the bills cause he can't remember, do all the shopping/appointments/taking him to and from work cause he can't drive (never has, doesn't try to learn at 32 y/o), pack his daily lunch, clean up his monstrous messes, finding everything he loses, remind him of important dates to file taxes, go to appointments, begged him to make daily to-do lists...and he can't mentally or physically put in the effort...I fucking can't. Married for almost 2 years. I can't take it anymore. Marriage is a team. It's 50/50. All the burden is on me and I can't leave. No job, no family, we have a 6 month old, no child care, car is fucking falling apart...I didn't sign up for this. My life and mental health has diminished. Omfg.
e15962f28c1e488f24be2772cf99a82e6bc0fd00be63d80f5b03821b7be99a22;;;We had The Talk;;;Last night my SO(dx/not medicated) and I had The Talk about where our relationship is going.   He told me that he doesn't feel loved for who he is. He wants and needs unconditional love from his partner and that I don't make him feel that way. That he would rather separate and find someone else who loves him just the way he is, "imperfections" and all.   We've discussed this in the past- how my love for him is not enough, how I am not showing it correctly, and I've tried to explain that I love my children unconditionally but not my partner. Four years ago I just broke- mentally and emotionally- and I dropped the rope of being his mother, of putting his welfare and preferences above my own. I started putting my energy into myself and working on myself.  I took self improvement classes through my work. I started to learn how to communicate better and started healing my own shit.   At this point ADHD wasn't part of the conversation.  It wasn't until our son (dx/medicated) began to really struggle with school that I went down this rabbit hole. I did not expect to discover all of this. I thought that I was alone.  Our problems were unique to US. We were special in our dysfunction.   Except we aren't.  There are so many of us in the same boat, fighting with the same impossible situations, strung out and lonely.  All facing the same lack of awareness and meager resources and all struggling to make sense of a story that is just beginning to be told. I guess that's the way I frame it...that ADHD research and canon is still in it's infancy and the cold hard relationship facts are still being discovered.    My SO knows that his brain is different.  But at 45 he is unwilling or unable to see how that difference effects his everyday life. 3 months ago during one of our talks I set a boundary- that he needed to research ADHD instead of just telling me how I am wrong when I bring it up. I explained how I felt like I stumbled upon a gold mine of information and support, and since it also affects our children that I needed him to be able to have these conversations with me.    He didn't research. He doesn't want to.  He'd rather find somebody else- someone who nurtures instead of reading. A woman who will take care of him without question, who will never tally up the cost to herself first. Who doesn't put a price on love.  A partner who is content to flit from note to note and doesn't need to understand the song.  There is sting in this decision, but there is grace too.  This feels honest, at least.
b45ef8afa8cb1b946affce00abdece15e00be88da1f0fb7d02686d72b26a00c4;;;Today felt abusive and I don't know what to do next;;;I'm 35 male, my boyfriend of 6 years is 36. I came home from my new job feeling good and excited to watch TV with him before he went to work (bartender so opposite of my 9-5). We've only recently learned about Rejection Sensitivity so I'm not sure what to do when it flares up.   But today was something special. I asked how his day was, we started talking about work last night, but at the same time I asked what he had been working on because he had a computer monitor on the coffee table. He said "it's none of your business!" And when I responded "um, what the fuck?" He said he was kidding and wanted to tell me about his day at work. So I asked him about it, felt better about him reacting crazy... He said it was a slow night and he didn't make much money. I said "well you work tonight, and it's right before Thanksgiving so you should make good tips this week, right?"  He then flew off the handle. It's hard for me to remember what he said next because I was caught off guard and felt super blindsided. But he said that I had to stop telling him how to feel, I was supposed to comfort him, and that I was gaslighting him.  I left, I had only been home for 5 minutes, wanted to play with the dog, but instead I went and drove around. Got food. Finally went back and just avoided him, waiting for him to go to work. When he left, he said he loved me, I didn't respond, which I know was petty and didn't help, but I was hurt. He left, then came back in, and told me that I need to manage my emotions, he's allowed to have bad moods, and if I can't handle that I shouldn't be here when he gets home. He told me "my name is the only one on the lease" and then went so far as to tell me our dog, who just turned one years old, is registered in his name. Then he left.   Yesterday we went and spent the day with his family and brought our dog and had a lovely time and even a nice drive. I don't know what happened. It makes me feel like I can't trust him and that I'm going crazy. I don't want to be here tonight, but I don't have anywhere else to go. I'm afraid he's going to wake me up when he gets home to kick me out after we lived together for 4 years. I'm lost, and feeling so alone.
9b1a8a86f7d031e3c55299852fb403edcb53d9a6f9c338920854add5b9685651;;;Communication and other symptom issues are ruining my marriage;;;He is dx, on meds but usually they wear off by the time I am around him. He takes med breaks regularly. He doubles up on Vyvanse (which I do not believe is doctor recommended) when he works double hours and I see the backlash when his body rebounds.  He won't answer the phone consistently. He won't answer SMS consistently. He doesn't do the "active listening" that all the experts tell people with ADHD to use with significant others to reduce friction and improve retention. When he's trying to say something, he gets really mad at me if I do the active listening (because it messes up his train of thought) and gets so mad that I won't listen but he takes such long pauses to begin speaking, then I say ok go ahead and talk and he won't.  He also misunderstands me and doesn't realize it, acts on wrong information. Our last attempt at a vacation was ruined because out of 2.5 days there were only 3 times we needed to be structured to get somewhere by a certain time and it caused huge arguments. He had doubled up on his meds just prior, and was grumpy because of it.  He also beats himself up internally so badly that I cannot actually talk about my own feelings regarding his symptoms. I cannot say "when I've had so many times that I tried to call you and you don't answer, I don't feel like I can trust you." I cannot say, "I feel unsafe and like I cannot rely on you because your availability is not predictable." He hears this as "maltreatment." He shames himself so badly that he won't even try to participate in the neurotypical process of repairing a relationship after causing harm whether the harm is intentional or not.  Oh, and my favorite thing to hate, he looks at his phone when we are trying to talk through problems, sometimes "because it helps me listen better" but sometimes as checking out/disrespect and I am so sick of him doing this whether it's to "help" or to hurt me.   I'm just tired of the chaos. I'm tired of things getting broken, routines falling apart, repeating myself. I'm especially tired of not being able to reach him on the phone. I told him I feel like I should list someone else as my emergency contact because who knows how long it will be before he calls a hospital back if I show up unconscious.
eecdcb59532a6047e6fa37c1064ae744569ed052483ada02fb0b0666d194003c;;;Wife forgot my birthday for 2nd year in a row;;;Recently posted about my wife (31 DX) constantly getting our kid to school late and lack of appreciation for everything I do. I appreciate all your advice and input, it helps to get feedback from people who deal with this issue.   Anyway, last year my wife forgot my birthday and I made a point to talk to her about it after it happened. I explained that it really hurt my feelings and that it’s already so rare for her to show any affection or ever take time to show me I’m special to her, that it hurts even more when she doesn’t even remember my birthday. She promised she would never do that again....  Well here we are a year later and she once again forgot. No happy birthday, no acknowledgment, today is just like any other day. After making a point to tell her about how I felt last year when she forgot, I’m actually really upset about it this year. I don’t expect anything or for her to get me a gift, but I wish she would at least acknowledge that today is my birthday and tried to make it a point to do better than last year.  I’m not sure how I should handle it this time, cause like the other issue of her being late, not showing affection is a recurring issue, and never making time to  show me she cares is something she is severely lacking.   What should I do? Should I confront her again? Do I have a right to even be upset? I know she has ADHD and part of that is being forgetful but this is the 2nd year in a row.... after I already talked to her about it last year... and I even reminded her last week, more than once, that my birthday was coming up...  honestly I don’t know how to handle this
fb0cb5fc2f7fe3caf8095bddd3526924fdb414baeffe882a9d0ab30d6d1d896f;;;Do you know where you stand in his life?;;;I’m tired of putting him as priority. With anything I do, he is always priority. But when it’s about me, i am easily removed in the equation and dismissed as whatever we planned is not of importance. His reason is,” because I think I am a big boy and I can do what I want.” He kept on saying it’s not true and I told him to stop brushing it off as it has always happened before.  I feel like shit. I had to cross interstate to accomodate his needs. Do his washing, drive him around but when I ask to spend time with me the answer is always I DON’T FUCKING KNOW if have plans or PLANS MAY COME UP SO I MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE. Then asks you to plan despite that and fucking cancels on you.  My friends have told me to just do it by myself. So after an argument today, i dropped him off and told him I’m going to the show I reserved and he shouldn’t come anymore. He ends up texting me that he wants to go. I told him i sent him the tickets and he can come if he wants to but I’m not reserving him any seats. He didn’t end up going. I had dinner alone, drank alone and walked alone. Don’t get me wrong but I like taking myself on dates but it is different when you planned to spend it with someone else.  I’m now in a lobby of the hotel we’re staying and crying the shit out of me. I feel like a horrible person and I don’t know why.

I think it could be over and I'm not sure how to process it. (F22 & M25)  In the last year I've done immense work on myself - therapy, meds, and starting my own side hustles. I've reached a whole new level of growth and independence for me. While I can tell that he has been trying very hard to pull himself up; it simply isn't working. Countless medication changes, plateauing depression, anxiety, ADHD, suspected ASD, extreme stress in his doctorate program, exhausting weekend shifts at work, and the inability to prioritize not only himself but "us" - I think I've just hit a point of complete disconnection romantically.   I can really see why it is hard for him. He has a lot on his plate. Most of us do in this day and age. But even when downtime is available nothing changes. If anything it accelerates.   9.9/10 times I initiate intimacy I'm met with his wall of anxiety and roadblocks. Initiation from his side seems to be a rare occurrence. 2+ nights a week I'm alone while he crams his exam studying in until 4am - other nights I end up alone in bed as he's playing video games until 2am. Every other weekend he works 10 hr days and comes home with his daily 6pm medication crash. He regularly picks up shifts he isn't scheduled for and his schooling keeps his mind occupied 7 days a week. He also joined a fraternity for his program a day after we had a big talk about time together. I'm responsible for 99% of the household chores, but I have my own work to handle as well. Deep conversation is a gateway to overwhelming emotions and spontaneous adventures are met with snappy attitudes.   We now have our own rooms in our townhouse and I'm slowly implementing our separation. I'm devastated and yet feel responsible somehow. It's lonely as a couple. There is only so much I can take as a partner. I feel so guilty to think these things as I see him struggling. I care about and love him very deeply. Deep down he really is a good man and a great friend, and I think that makes it so much harder. I'm always trying to convince myself that it's horrible for me to break it off for those reasons, but it's also ok to accept that sometimes as much as you want something to work, and as much as you try, sometimes, it might not end up the way you were hoping. 7 years is a long time. Letting that go will be one of the hardest things I've done.

We've been married for 10 years and went through IVF for 5 of those years to finally have our beautiful baby boy (who's 16 months old now).  My wife has always known that she's had anxiety...but she never did anything about it...until the past 6 months when I had finally had enough.  She's tried a few different meds (lexapro, zoloft, and now prozac) - and none seemed to have worked so far.  She's taken small doses of each meds, but nothing has seemed effective.  We have struggled for years because of my wife's poor mental health...and my inability to deal with it.  She's just recently been diagnosed with GAD and ADHD.  Our home is always a mess.  The kitchen is rarely clean, the laundry rarely gets done, and papers pile up - not to mention how dusty and disgusting our home is (especially our bathrooms).  She keeps telling me that she knows that she's not well...and that she's trying her best...and the she always good intentions...but I can't help being frustrated.  As it seems many other ADHD partners know all too well, I am forced to take on WAY TOO MUCH responsibility in our relationships.  I am the sole breadwinner, I'm the only one that cooks, I am the only one the pays the bills, I'm the only one that does our son's dishes, I do most of the regular dishes, I clean the house (as best as I can)...and so many other things.  I'm burnt out...and have been for years.  There are some days when things are "normal" and she helps out and does a good job of not being co-dependent on me...and those days...I feel fine and hopeful that things could get better.  But there are SO MANY other days where she struggles and I have to pick up the slack.  If things got better...I could see myself finding happiness again...but...it's been 10 years and filled with her empty promises.  If we didn't have a child...I probably would leave her.  I honestly probably should've already before we had a child...but I guess I was too afraid of the unknown.  I just don't where I should draw the line of acceptance with her inaction...and justifiable frustration.  I feel guilty all the time that I criticize her and get frustrated with her...but I just think that I've become far too critical and pessimistic because I've had to deal with her untreated ADHD.  She's trying to figure it out now...and willing to try new meds...but I just don't know if I have it in me to ride this out.  I don't see any light at the end of the tunnel.  Some encouragement...support...personal anecdotes would be great.  I'm in a rough place mentally...and I think I may even be depressed due to my marital distress.  Around others, I feel fine.  At work, I feel fine.  In my marriage though?  I feel depressed...and I feel like I've mentally checked out years ago.
7c84053af45a91bb5cf51200431c3ce496ec39e5fd2d2afa10179889f18dc72b;;;Help with communicating negative impact;;;Do any of you all have tips on how to tell your partner that something they are doing is impacting you negatively? I (NT) have tried different ways of communicating these things to my partner (DX, medicated) and I seem to step in it no matter what.   For example, "I" statements about how I feel in "x" situation often lead to long defensive monologues about why they did what they did and how it's a perfectly reasonable thing to do; being forthright and speaking up in the moment leads to being spoken over and interrupted; waiting for a time when everyone is calm and relaxed leads to long, winding discussions that go in circles and don't resolve with any sort of agreement. I suspect, from things I've read here and elsewhere, that these reactions are largely tied to their ADHD.  Please, internet, help! Have you found any ways of letting your partner know when they've hurt you or someone else that helps them "get it" without either getting into an argument or being steamrolled?   Also, I'm so glad to have found this community! It's such a relief to know that I'm not alone.

Except now it's driving me crazy. Every day. Every conversation. All about trains. I'll be in the middle of a conversation with him regarding dinner or something and he'll start taking about a new train he just found as bargain.

Piles of clothes, trash, rotten food mixed in with piles of clean/dirty clothes, shoved under bed, down in the couch, shoved in unused back-packs/bags  Throwing trash/food on the floor in a clean room for no reason  Not showering for weeks  Wearing dirty clothes/underwear over and over for weeks  Not brushing teeth for months  Not wiping hands when eating, then touching and soiling everything with food covered hands. Walls, light switches, clothes, remotes/controllers etc  My husband is adhd dx and suggested ASD. He's disgusting and I'm a control/clean freak. I'm just trying to understand what the hell is going on here. He smells and he's gross. I won't eat anything he's prepared because of his black fingernails and lack of cleanliness. I also won't touch anything he's touched without cleaning it first because he leaves greasy debris on everything. We don't sleep together and I've pushed him and all of his trash into a spare bedroom, which literally smells like a stock yard. He says he just doesn't remember to pick up or clean himself or his environment.
2ac7f9154400ffa61c86e1a72e2eee48ae5eb847153be6238daf00d441c2f3d6;;;I need some serious support right now as I pack to move out;;;After over 3 years of dating and two years of living together, my relationship over.  He has been flip flopping between ignoring the fact that I'm moving out and angrily demanding that I help him clean the house and find a replacement roommate while I pack my things. With only two weeks left, he is growing increasingly difficult to deal with.  For me, this break up is over two things: My consistent feelings of being a last priority and/or nonexistent to him and his shocking disinterest in working through matters of life. Because of this I am finding it *exceptionally* difficult to put my feelings aside (*again*) and help him.   He is slamming doors, screaming at me, demanding I help him. We've been fighting every single day but I generally still am trying to treat him decently. If I'm ordering food I still ask him if he'd like something. If he seems upset I have still been asking what I can do to help but I've stopped that now.   I stopped because when I've been sad or in need lately, as we bring this nightmare to close, he's looked me in the eye and told me he doesn't care. He disappears into his video games, laughing and joking with friends all night while I cry or panic behind him in bed. Then he'll need help or be sad and if I don't voluntarily help, he'll defensively ask for my help and tell me he'll help me out when I need it. Spoiler: his repayment is telling me theres only X amount of days left and not to talk to him about anything because he just doesn't care at all.   So this roommate replacement does involve me and I have asked around and posted some in between moments of motivating myself to pack up and get away from this person. This person I still love and see as good but who's *seriously* denying himself the help he needs. This person I'm ashamed to admit I've treated so poorly - a long &amp; entirely different story.   But I just can't give him anything. It is actively hurting me to watch him be in such a tough spot and not help  as much as possible. I keep feeling like it's all my fault that he's in this position and reminding myself that he put himself in this spot is not helping. I want to help him but I *cannot* keep giving time and energy to him in these final days when he so blatantly cares naught to return such basic decency.    Should I suck it up and let him treat me like trash for two weeks as I help him out or should I keep up with my boundaries for these final days? I really cannot believe what my life had been for the last 6 months, especially these last two.   I've been basically shaking trying to keep my composure as he sucks the life out of every inch of this space today. I could really, really use some positive words of support.

So I’m asking here, as a recently diagnosed Inattentive ADHD male in his 50s, because maybe there are people like me after all.  I’ve been with my partner for over two years. She was the one who suggested that I might have ADHD when I was suffering from severe anxiety. She put up with some severe craziness from me and always picked up the pieces and helped me through. I couldn’t possibly love her more.  So here’s the thing: it’s now her turn to expect something from me. She has a crazy workload at the moment and she can’t even delegate or take time off as she’s the only one able to do what she does. Needless to say, she’s stressed. Breaking down crying, unable to eat, visibly shaking stressed. She needs me to step up... and I want to... but I’m failing. I can’t seem to find a way to be there in any effective way for her. I’ve still got all my chaotic stuff going on: lost my job, industrial tribunal, ex threatening me with suicide because I don’t have money for maintenance, but I need to put that aside and be there for her like she’s always been for me.  I try but I don’t do a very good job of it and I feel like hiding myself away rather than deal with her pain. I feel like a little child. It frustrates me that I lack the toolset to help her. She thinks I don’t give a damn about her because I’m not doing enough to help. If only she knew how much I was trying. It must be agony for her to want someone to ease the pain yet watch them fail and sometimes make it worse.  So my question is, since nothing seems to be geared toward helping the person without ADHD, are there any techniques out there to help? We’re both so lost right now.

Since I realized what was going on with him I knew that unless he gets help, there was not much hope. So I started leading my life as independently as possible and turned to friends and family for help and support. But now with the pandemic he is working from home. I feel like I am trapped with an adult teenager. We have two little kids and own a home together. He does a few things for the kids and the house but other than that he goes about like it is all my problem. I had help from others to cope with everything I had to do as the responsibilities kept piling on me over the years (yes, I am an idiot, it took me years to finally understand what was going on with him...by then the kids and the house were in the picture), but now with the pandemic, those folks cannot even come over. I am bottling up without being assertive to keep the peace because he gets aggressive. I do not know how to get through this without exploding! I genuinely feel that dealing with him has been more challenging than facing the pandemic. Please help!!

We've been dating for 3 years and living together for 1 and a half.   I feel like we waited way to long to start couples therapy and expect to grow as a happy couple but I'd love to imagine it's still possible.   I have had "overemotional" tendencies my entire life (didn't know until this past year that it was at least in part due to ADD) but have never turned to self harm until I started dating my boyfriend.   I have begun having rage attacks since we became a couple which often turn into me punching, choking, or otherwise hurting myself so that I do not hurt anyone else or anything around me. It gives me anxiety just typing it out.   Over the past couple years I have really been trying to figure out the cause of this as well as ways I can make it stop. There seems to be a pretty strong connection between my rage attacks and my boyfriends own emotional dysregulation.   If the words coming out of my mouth are not a 100% pleasant or fun topic, I will be faced with annoyance, blame, or avoidance. I feel like I've tried every approach to navigate this but it constantly ends in me being forced to internalize my feelings or problems and keep a smile on my face.   A lot of the time, I can only use my learned techniques for so long before I default to another rage attack. I have been practicing keeping a calm tone but loose my cool after being told repeatedly that I am still to blame because I wasn't happy sounding enough while expressing my upset or I am to blame because I brought up  being disappointed at all.  I always feel extreme guilt and shame afterwards and am apologetic and try to do things to make it better. I never hear an apology or acknowledgement from my boyfriend that he does anything wrong or might possibly play a role in what leads me to such a terrifying emotional state.  I just hate that I am left feeling like I am the *only* problem here when I know I am not. I do not behave this way around anyone else and have never acted this way around previous partners who were capable of discussing serious or unpleasant topics.   I feel so empty and drained and like an impossibly unlovable sociopath thanks to all this paired with our roommate/his BFF calling me that many times behind my back.

They barely want to interact when we’re home together, but they instantly miss me when we’re apart. It’s very sweet, but it’s weird for me to switch into being an attentive partner to my ADHD when they usually just want to be left alone.   I guess related to this is that my SO will go long periods of time without actively seeking out my attention or our interactions. Most interactions are instigated by me. But then a couple times a year they will look at me and say something like “My God, you’re beautiful,” almost with surprise. It’s very sweet and of course I’m very sweet in response, but I can’t help but feel like they haven’t REALLY looked at me or noticed me in a long time. Haha. I just find it so interesting.   Just curious if anyone else experiences this.

As my headline suggests I am looking for advice and experiences of ADHD partners or people suffering from ADHD to tell me what they were able to work on.  My partner is as exhausted as most posts on this sub suggest and basically broke up with me. After long talking and suggesting things we agreed to work on our relationship through couples therapy, dedicated date nights and me abstaining from gaming/too much surfing as it definitely decreases my attention span. I am also in therapy / on medication and meditate daily for at least 10 minutes but there might be other things I might not be thinking off that helped your relationship.  Thanks in advance!
