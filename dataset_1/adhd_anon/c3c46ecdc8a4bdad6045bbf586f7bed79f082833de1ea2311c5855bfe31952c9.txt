'Stop making excuses and just do your shit. This ADHD thing isn't real and if it is then I also have it and you should stop being lazy'.   That's all I'm greeted with ever.  EDIT: Wow, never thought my small rant would blow up like this. Love you guys, thanks for all the advice. With a community like this i'm sure i'll be just fine! :)
