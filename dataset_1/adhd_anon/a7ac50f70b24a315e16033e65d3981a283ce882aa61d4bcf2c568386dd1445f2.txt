a7ac50f70b24a315e16033e65d3981a283ce882aa61d4bcf2c568386dd1445f2;;;Rejection Dysphoria kicking my ass;;;I thought I was doing really well at work because I was getting a lot of things done and completing a ton of things. But then my boss came in and immediately started accusing me and someone else of things that we did not do, and then complained about how I didn't get "more important things done"  Honestly for the past 2 days this has just crushed me. Like I thought I was doing well only to be yelled at for something else. It shouldn't matter to me but I've lost all motivation to even try because what's the fucking point.  I'm apart of a team and no one else on the team was yelled at about this. It was just me. I'm so depressed about it I don't even want to go to work. I hate feeling like this so much. I obsess over these things and ultimately it destroys me emotionally. I feel like I have no support system because no one sees how much it hurts me because on the surface it just seems like its not that big of a deal and I should get over it.  I really want a hug from someone but I really have no one to talk to. I feel so alone.  &#x200B;  EDIT: I don't know how many people will see this edit but I want to thank every one for the support. I was feeling very low when I wrote this and now I am tearing up for a completely different reason; the amount of support and love I feel right now is overwhelming. This is a fantastic community and I really appreciate all of you for being here for me when I was so far down.
