9ceeb186b62acf3ea74cfddec7b625146ae169615bb19756333f76883a29b2e0;;;Getting off social media was the best thing I have ever done for my mental health;;;TLDR; deactivated facebook, made new Instagram that is solely for posting progress on my main hobby... I have *so much* more time and dopamine because I'm not mindlessly looking at anxiety-inducing crap.   About a month ago, I made a post on my social media saying I was taking a break. Shortly Afterwards, I deactivated facebook, made a new Instagram solely for rollerskating progress (my main hobby), and I customized my reddit feed to be centered around my hobbies, interests, and enjoyment. I avoid the front page.   My dudes, let me tell you. Hours of my day have been given back because I'm not getting lost in other people's drama, other people's lives... Blah blah. I still keep up with what's going on in the world, but it's *so much easier* to "switch off". I don't feel attached to my phone anymore.   Not comparing my life to that of my family, friends, and acquaintances (because let's face it, we do this whether we realize it or not) has been the single most freeing thing I've done. Besides choosing to ditch the bra. But I digress.   Thanks for reading  **EDIT**:: I am very much aware that Reddit is social media. Maybe a more appropriate title would have been "limiting my social media presence and removing triggering/toxic content and/or people is the best thing I've done for my mental health" but that's a little too wordy IMO.   That being said, sometimes we just gotta be contrarian lil bitches and point out semantic flaws with no filter so like, I get it. Lol.  EDIT numero dos:: this got more attention than I expected and I will never respond to all the comments but omg thank u for the support and the stories! You guys rock.
