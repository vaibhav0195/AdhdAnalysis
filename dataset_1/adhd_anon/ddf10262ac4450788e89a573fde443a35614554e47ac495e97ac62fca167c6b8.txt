My manager turned the corner into my cubicle, and there I am sitting at my desk closely inspecting two bottlecaps and clicking them together like a caveman who discovered flint rocks. I was actually doing some detective work, realizing I had two Hydroflasks made in two different years (\~2018 and 2019), and their special "insulated" cap seems to be made differently between those two years. I was tapping though together and noticed one of them seemed more hollow than the other and the newer one is more textured on the rubber handle (Probably just normal usage/weathering). I didn't get to figure out whether the newer one was higher/lower quality than the previous year's, or exactly why the hollow one was heavier than the other.  He stared at what I was doing for probably 2-3 seconds before I noticed him. Fortunately I wasn't behind on any work, and there wasn't anything to be criticized of me besides the fact that I was getting paid for investigating Hydroflask's design changes.  I think next time I'll make sure I don't double up day and run out of my prescription a day early.  Thanks for reading, let's finish this week strong :)  EDIT: [Thought I might include a picture of what the bottlecap I was so intrigued by.](https://i.imgur.com/Zz16NbB.jpg)  EDIT2: I woke up to this post blowing up - I'm leaving all of my typos in, and you're all beautiful people - remember, amongst our flaws we all have unique strengths in some aspect :)
