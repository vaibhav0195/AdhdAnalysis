e8cc1ad374123f727c3984aa770e0087787956a7d66876355ed8623f687eeaf7;;;Accepted to Harvard Law School with ADHD!!!;;;I just wanted to share, this sub has been real helpful and relatable, and I just wanted to let you guys know that there is a lot you can achieve with ADHD, sometimes in spite of it, and other times because of it. Clearly, it all affects us differently, and I think plenty of people in this sub have worse symptoms than me, but I think there is a lot of upside to being a creative, emotional, and forgetful ball of energy. I feel so happy, life doesn't feel real. I got a parking ticket today because all I can think about is where I'm going to law school.  Thank you guys for being here, and don't count yourselves out due to your diagnosis!
