But can we also discuss the inability to get started on a task without outside motivation?  This seems to be a secondary ADHD problem that doesn't get talked about as much.  This seems to be a source of ADJD people being labled as "lazy" because we sometimes lack the ability/motivation to get up and *just do it*.   I remember seeing a Russell Barkley video a while back where he makes the analogy of a rocket sitting on a launch pad, but it won't go anywhere because there's no fuel in it.  I suppose this could also be a metaphor for the lack of dopamine to self start which just isn't there.  Dopamine is strongly related to motivation.   Comments anyone?
