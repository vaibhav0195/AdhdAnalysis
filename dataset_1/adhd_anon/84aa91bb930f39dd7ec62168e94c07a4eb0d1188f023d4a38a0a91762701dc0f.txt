84aa91bb930f39dd7ec62168e94c07a4eb0d1188f023d4a38a0a91762701dc0f;;;I’m SO HAPPYYY I found my keys after a full 5 days. Big relief , now I can finally leave my apartment to get food because god knows how long I’ve been starving;;;About 5 days ago I wanted to go leave my apartment to go get groceries , when it struck it where are my keys. I have a designated place for my essential stuff when I leave (wallet, phone, keys and earphones) . If something is not at that designated area I don’t know where it is. So I was stuck in my apartment for 5 days , with barely any groceries and I couldn’t even leave to get any groceries . I have finals going on as well so didn’t get much time to look for it as I didn’t have any plans of leave my apartment other than for grocery, which I was fine with not getting because I fast for 30 straight days in a month once a year so my body is used to it. My roommates are also not here so I couldn’t borrow their keys either. Anyways, just like an hour ago while writing my statistics final exam , it clicked. I remembered in the middle of the fricking exam where the keys are . The question on the assessment was talking about geese , which reminded me of winter , which in turn reminded me of the new winter jacket I got which has a small pocket for stuff like keys etc. I ran to my closet and put my hands into that pocket and as soon I felt the keys, there was this moment. This moment of realization that I was correct, that I remembered where I kept them. I laughed because my ADHD brain got me into the trouble, and that same brain got me out of it. Now I’m about to head out to get some McDonald’s , ah I’m so hungry I cannot wait. Sorry if this is to long have an amazing week guys take care stay hydrated, byeee  Ps- the exam went really well !!!  Edit 1: THANK YOU FOR THE AWARD <3 and i edited some grammar.
