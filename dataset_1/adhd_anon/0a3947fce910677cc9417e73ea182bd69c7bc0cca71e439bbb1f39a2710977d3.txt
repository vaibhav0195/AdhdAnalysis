Having to buy replacements for things that I’ve forgotten to bring somewhere, impulsively buying weird shit and never using it, perusing expensive hobbies I abandon, buying a massive amount of caffeine and nicotine, having to pay for another train ticket after I lost my return...   The list goes on   I wonder how much I could’ve saved if I didn’t have ADHD, and how many other expenses I haven’t realised might be thanks to my adhd. ugh
