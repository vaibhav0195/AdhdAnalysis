243f4da8fed69b79d429e6eba82b20fc18232c717f2eadad3f0073d7acd9ad1b;;;I went on a drug holiday and realised I can never go back;;;My psychiatrist, the one who diagnosed me with inattentive adhd, suggested every month or so I take a drug holiday. The means I take a weekend without taking any dexies to make sure it’s still working. I lasted until about 11am before taking my medication. I couldn’t stand it anymore.    At first, I thought i was having withdrawals. I was tired, withdrawn, unable to think about anything. I had been looking forward to having the day to myself to play video games and rather than playing video games, I just sat on the couch. Eventually, it hit me. I wasn’t having withdrawals. This is how I was. This is me unmedicated. This is how I loved the first 29 years of my life.    I never want to feel like that again. Sorry doc, drug holidays aren’t going to work for me. Being a functioning human being just feels too good.    Edit: I had no idea so many people would end up reading this. That’s why I haven’t responded very much! But the variety of responses had made one thing clear to me: I, and everyone else on medication for their ADHD, needs to do what’s best for them. I think I’ll experiment a bit from here, as many have said a drug holiday helps them. I clearly need to find a balance!
