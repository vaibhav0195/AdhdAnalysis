I was so excited about it, things were making so much *sense,* for the first time ever.  Since then, I've been noticing weird patterns.  Whenever I tell someone I have ADHD, the response seems to be along the lines of  "That's really not a big deal" or "I'm sooo ADHD sometimes too."  I've tried to explain that it's not, like, a quirky personality trait for you to have, but nobody seems to really care? I think a big part of it is TikTok. People are making videos that get millions of views of their 'ADHD moments' where they get distracted in the middle of doing something or essentially just say random shower thoughts as if they didn't steal them from reddit/tumblr/twitter.  It's always sort of irritated me, but lately it's been REALLY getting on my nerves, because now whenever I say "I have ADHD" or bring it up at all, I can feel people judging me. Someone ranted at me because they said I was faking it for attention. It's literally just the most irritating thing, I wish people stopped using it as a joke or trend or whatever.  &#x200B;  Edit: Okay, I definitely didn't expect this to blow up so much! Thankyou for all of the amazing messages and replies I've gotten, it's really amazing to hear how this affects so many people. That being said, I do want to clear something up:  I promise I'm not starting every conversation with "I have ADHD" (though in retrospect I understand how people might have thought that) It was more when I was first diagnosed, I was being taken out of class often (3 times a week at least) to talk to my Psychologist, or by the school, and it hadn't really occurred to me at that time that ADHD was something most people kept hidden. If someone asked me where I'd been I pretty much just told them as it seemed like a natural thing to do (and honestly I still don't really want to keep it a secret.)
