94f48d0f82435679527566ab30f4dc5d96d229d6f8f2c77f0d74196f7d8cc905;;;I always forget/doubt that I have ADHD and blame my symptoms on lack of intelligence/innate flaws/anxiety/early dementia (lol);;;I seriously beat myself up all the time for my ADHD symptoms and only every now and then do I accept that I have ADHD and feel a bit better about myself. I know I have a diagnosis and take meds but I still feel this way. I was diagnosed at 17 (23 now) and I just feel like I can’t get over what my explanations were for it in the past (feeling stupid). I’ve accomplished a lot (double majored in molecular biology and neuroscience) but I still feel like an idiot and a loser. I still struggle to learn, it takes forever for me to get through training at work and I feel like my coworkers think I’m dumb. I always think that adhd is an excuse I’ve made up for myself...
