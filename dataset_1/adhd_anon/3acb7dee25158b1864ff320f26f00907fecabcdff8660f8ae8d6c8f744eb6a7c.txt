Edit: oh my gosh thank you for all the amazing and kind replies and overwhelming positivity. I can‚Äôt possibly reply to you all but had a little happy cry in the bath.  Some points that have been asked a lot:  My med regime: The meds that work for me might not work for you, it‚Äôs best to talk it out with your psych and experiment. It‚Äôs taken me almost 9 months to work out the big kinks and I still have better days and worse days on them.   The secret: the meds and diagnosis were the final piece of the puzzle.   Other v important bits in no particular order:   - Getting my depression treated - Going to a fuck tonne of therapy (different kinds) - Asking for help - Building a support network - Asking my GP for help but advocating for myself (went armed with an annotated DSM-IV) - Luck - Forcing myself to sleep - Forcing myself to exercise - Forcing myself to eat vegetables - Working constantly and desperately on routines (it‚Äôs never work but I was trying to study, trying to be on time etc, I‚Äôd literally sit at a desk for 8 hours everyday for weeks before a deadline/exam but manage to do nothing until the day before) - Figuring out what works for me e.g. I don‚Äôt go to lectures nor do I review them. I do, however, get involved in lots of practical stuff and moulage days etc because that‚Äôs how I learn best.  In short: therapy + support network + never giving up (kind of) then getting diagnosed + meds = achieving *consistency* which is they key üîë   Love this community and it‚Äôs overwhelming positivity and support ‚ù§Ô∏è   Edit: formatted and stuff üò¨
