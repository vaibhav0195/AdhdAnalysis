Everytime one of us feels frustrated and unmotivated, as is often the case with this disorder, we communicate this by telling the other that "The plate is too small". How this came to be is kind of a fun story.  I was once preparing dinner for my wife, some vegetables and meat. We only have two plates in our appartment : one big plate for my wife to eat in, and one small plate for storing leftovers in the fridge.  Before you ask, yes, we only have two plates to avoid accumulating dirty dishes. It works pretty well. Personaly, I prefer a bowl.  Anyway, the normal plate was dirty while I was serving her dinner. And I was already frustrated and unmotivated that day, so instead of gathering the motivation to just wash it, I went and tried to serve the meal in the small plate.  First I put vegetables, but then there is no place for the meat. Instead of accepting the problem and dealing with it in an adult way, I spend A FULL MINUTE trying to find a way to fit the meat on top of the vegetables on this very small plate, and obviously failing.  Finally, my wife in the living room hear me yell in frustration and anger, and ask me what's wrong. I yell back, with my saddest voice : "The plate is too small !"  She immediatly burst into laughter at the ridicule of the situation. Suddenly realizing how stupid I must sound right now, I can't help but start laughing too.  Ever since this happened, anytime one of us was too annoyed or frustrated to deal with the current situation, we'd always talk about how small the plate is.
