The last weeks, I have been looking at this subreddit as one of my sources to try to figure out if I could have ADHD.   And I was shocked...  When people ask questions, other people answer them, instead of telling them they're idiots. When people share something about their lives, other people say weird stuff like "thanks for sharing" and "good luck" instead of finding some way of offending them.  At this point I'm not even sure I really believe that this is actually Reddit...  Edit: oh wow thank you for the awards! I really just pointed something obvious out but thanks!  Edit 2: Ok this is officially the best place on the internet...  Edit 3: Ok yâ€™all being silly with those awards now!
