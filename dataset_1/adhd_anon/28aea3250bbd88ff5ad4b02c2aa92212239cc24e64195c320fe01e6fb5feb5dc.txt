28aea3250bbd88ff5ad4b02c2aa92212239cc24e64195c320fe01e6fb5feb5dc;;;I watched my son hyperfocus for the first time yesterday;;;My son, almost nine, is about as ADHD as you can get.  He's a hyper, emotional and hilarious little string bean of a boy who hates school work like any kid and hates remote learning even more.  He's sat there for hours before trying to translate a math lesson to paper, and we have to constantly remind him to stay on task or go back and fix his handwriting.  After a long, almost excruciating day of remote learning, my son decided to find a book about Japanese words on his schools digital library. He's been really interested in the country lately.  Two hours later the kid has the *most organized and clean layout I've ever seen him make* with English words on the left and Japanese pronunciations and writing on the right.    Yesterday I saw the classic "if you would put as much effort in to your homework as you do your interests.." moment that I had heard so many times from my parents.  I saw myself and my hobbies as a kid and adult, overtaking any current interests I had and enveloping my thoughts and time. Hell, even as an adult I have hobbies that can consume me for hours on end.     It warmed my heart seeing him grow intellectually, but terrified me because I know what's to come when high school rolls around.  It was really neat to see him like me in a way that doesn't make me feel ashamed of my ADHD.  It's something that he can use and utilize for his own interests and hopefully someday maybe a livelihood. Maybe not writing random foreign language words down, but another passion that he's found.
