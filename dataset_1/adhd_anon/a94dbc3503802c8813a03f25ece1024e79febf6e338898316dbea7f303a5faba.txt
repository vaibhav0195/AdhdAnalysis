It’s difficult for me to start any long term goals because I know they won’t get completed as I will give up part way through. I’m not really sure if it’s my Aspergers which I have been diagnosed for, or if I also have ADHD.    It really sucks because there are things I want to succeed but never manage to do that.  Does anyone else have the same experience?
