Even though it runs in my family and I’ve exhibited all the symptoms, I wasn’t able to get diagnosed until recently. After a month of confirmed ADHD and no medication other than my anxiety meds, my girlfriend talked to me about telling my psychiatrist about ADHD and asking for meds. She prescribed me with a small dose of Adderall, which I took this morning for the first time. And for the first time in my entire life, my mind was quiet. No longer did I have to have 3 songs, a tv show and a Shakespearean sonnet all over each other going on in my head. I was able to finish my homework that would have normally taken me 5-6 hours in three while not being constantly distracted by my parents watching tv in the other room, or the AC buzzing. Easy to say, I cried. Thank you for supplying a place to let me share this news.
