I finally got diagnosed with ADHD at 29 after a string of misdiagnosis... everything from GAD to Bipolar, depression, OCD. No medication has ever worked for me whatsoever.  After a year of struggling with FMLA for panic attacks at work, which I realize now were anxiety from a lack of productivity etc, my new psychiatrist in Nashville (i recently moved and was forced to find a new one) suggested maybe these other conditions were just symptoms/coping mechanisms/learned behavioral patterns from ADHD.  It was like a light bulb. I’m sad I didn’t know sooner. But a few days with proper medication and I feel like a completely different human being. I can’t believe it.  If you feel like your diagnosis isn’t right please don’t give up. Find a doctor that really listens to you and your whole story and doesn’t just pull out a script pad 5 min in.  I feel like my entire life is about to change.
