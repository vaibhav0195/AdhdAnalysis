I mentioned it to him in my film class and how it's actually a bigger struggle than I thought it would be, especially when wearing headsets. I really have to focus and concentrate to make sure everything goes smoothly, and I get easily overstimulated.  I emailed him in length about this struggle and what my disorder is. I just asked to not be put on as director anymore because it was overwhelming -- it was the only thing I directly asked for. But then, I additionally mentioned my struggle with hearing and taking in directions. I just said it might take me a little longer to remember how to work the big equipment. Thought nothing of it and sent the email.  The next day we were learning how to use graphics equipment. He handed everyone in the class a printed-out version of directions, brushing it off as a cheat-sheet. Didn't single me out. Didn't talk to me after or anything. Just introduced it as a cheat sheet.  I almost cried right then and there, to be honest. I didn't even *ask* for it, and he printed the directions out -- and didn't make it obvious it was done for me. Sometimes professors can be fucking fantastic.
