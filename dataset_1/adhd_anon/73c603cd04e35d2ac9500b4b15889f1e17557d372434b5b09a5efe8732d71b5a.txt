How many people have never been diagnosed because they saw the name and were like “*ok I clearly don’t have ADHD because I have attention but I just can’t help where it goes or when, also my emotions and memory and motivation are all whack but who knows why*” and never get the right support they need.  At least give ADHD a more relevant name that doesn’t immediately mislead people.   It not only hinders productive conversation about ADHD but also really downplays the myriad of other symptoms that can have way more serious impacts on people’s wellbeing than something like “Can’t Stop Fidgeting Disorder” suggests.
