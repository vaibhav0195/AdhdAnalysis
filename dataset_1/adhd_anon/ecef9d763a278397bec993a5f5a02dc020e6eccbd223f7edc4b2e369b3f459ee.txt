ecef9d763a278397bec993a5f5a02dc020e6eccbd223f7edc4b2e369b3f459ee;;;my friends just said that anyone born with cellphones/ the internet has ADHD and........;;;this is why i don't tell people i have ADHD. it's so fucking annoying, i just gave them a blank stare and said that ADHD isn't i-cant-stay-off-my-phone disorder. why does no one actually understand how bad it is? a very good part of my childhood trauma is because of my ADHD  (my parents both have V short tempers). not only is it bad in all the horrible ways it sets you back/hinders your everyday life, it absolutely destroyed my self esteem - and that has messed up a lot of things in my life. i never feel good enough and when i hear people around me say shit like this it only reminds me of how no one will ever understand what im going through or take my struggles seriously.   sorry for the negativity guys but this is the only place i can come to to talk about this :(
