b7ac7c4ec9c1067de4f71045e818d29670a9d38661eadb9c5dbcdbc544668483;;;Feeling like i have no time to do stuff whilst i do nothing all day;;;Every single day is like this, i just have so many options out there, perhaps start a new course on programming, or anything, but i just end up scrolling through reddit whilst my brain keep telling me how much time ''i don't have''.  It's so annoying, every time i try to do something new or try an online course, for example, i just think about why ''i have no time for this'' and end up watching some stupid youtube video.  Anybody else going through this?
