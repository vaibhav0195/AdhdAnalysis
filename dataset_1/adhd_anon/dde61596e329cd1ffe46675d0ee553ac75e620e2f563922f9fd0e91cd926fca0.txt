When I have to ask customers to repeat themselves they usually always say sorry it's hard to understand with the masks on. Secretly I'm going no it's literally that I forgot what you just said 2 seconds ago or I heard you talking but not an ounce of it was processed. I feel a lot less guilty about having to ask people to repeat themselves now. I call that a personal mini win.
