They tell me to stop using my ADD as an excuse; but you see if they would remember it on their own I wouldn’t have to constantly remind them when my ADD causes me to behave a certain way.   Oh I’m sorry my disability is such a hindrance to you, but just try being me for even a day. You wouldn’t last 5 minutes. And my ADD is moderate. I don’t even want to think about what those with severe ADHD go through.   My own family tells me to pay attention, and when I showed my mom an ADHD meme she told me “you should just try harder” as if it’s a choice. I got diagnosed 9 years ago and my family has yet to understand what it does to me. They don’t seem to try to either.   They always seem to expect me to do things at their pace too, which I can’t do. It stresses me out. They expect me to just get up and go when I can’t motivate myself that easily. They expect me to be able to do things within a certain frame of time when giving me a time limit stresses me out.   I’m done living other people’s ways instead of my own.  Edit: I didn’t realize so many people struggled so badly because of this same exact situation. I’m sorry y’all had to go through what you did, but at least we have each other on this subreddit now.  Edit 2: Holy shit I got an award, thank you kind sir/lass for my first ever award on this app. It made my day. Thank you for all the awards you guys!
