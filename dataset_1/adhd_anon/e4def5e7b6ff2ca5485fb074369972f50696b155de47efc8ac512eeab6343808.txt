e4def5e7b6ff2ca5485fb074369972f50696b155de47efc8ac512eeab6343808;;;I got called into the office at my new job today.;;;I got my first full time/legit job since being medicated over a year ago; I started a week and a half ago, today I got called into the office, when I walk in my boss looks at me straight faced and asks "what are we going to do with you?" Well, if you're ADHD this is a familiar talk, and it doesn't ever go well...........I don't say anything because that always makes it worse, he says "it's obvious we're underpaying you, how about a $3 raise and we'll assess you in another 3 months for another $3.  Uh....What?
