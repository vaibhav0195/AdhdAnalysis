But then I still forget to watch/listen for that thing and I have to rewind again. I don't get this! What is my brain even doing after I rewind? I have zero drive to listen for that thing despite just rewinding. I have sometimes rewinded up to 4 times. I end up concluding that it was just not engaging enough for me to figure out what happened there. I actually want to know what happened, but the lead up didn't contain enough that interested me.  This is especially awkward when watching a movie with others. Was rewatching Breaking Bad with my husband last night. So this is a show I've already seen but I remember like nothing! Something important happened, but as usual, I forgot to watch TV while WATCHING TV!! So I ask my husband to rewind. Whoops, forgot to watch AGAIN. Rewind again. Forgot to watch. I pretend I didn't understand what happened and need to see it again when really I just forgot to watch again. One more time. Yup. No idea what happened, didn't watch it. I now have to pretend I saw what happened because nobody without ADHD would even believe this.  I listen to the news all the time too. My husband will listen while doing 5 other things and say "wow, that's shocking!" and I am like "what is?" and he's like...what they just said on the news! Oh....wasn't listening....  Edit: oh ya and never mind that breaking bad is a tv show and not even a movie lol
