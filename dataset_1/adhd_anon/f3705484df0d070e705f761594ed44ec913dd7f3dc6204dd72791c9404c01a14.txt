EVERY teacher always used to descride me as the student that "could do very well in school if she could focus and make more of an effort".  The only reason I didn't get in trouble for my hyperactivity is that the teachers never scolded the female students. Each time I talked to my guyfriends during class, they would get the blame. Every time I would bother my guyfriends, they would get the blame. Even when they did absolutely nothing.   The signs were all there, the issues were all there, but they all got overshadowed by the guys in my class that had the more hyperactive type of adhd.    Edit: okay so alot of people are bringing up the fact that the inattentive type of adhd is harder to spot, but I have the combined type and I was hyper and disruptive in school, but my issues still got ignored. I'm not saying that boys with the inattentive type don't go unnoticed too, but I still feel like this is more common with girls
