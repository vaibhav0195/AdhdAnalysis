Be proud of what you manage.;;;I’m on a phased return to work, after being off for over a year. I hadn’t been diagnosed with ADHD and the uncontrolled symptoms were making it very difficult for me to stay in work. My depression and anxiety were in overdrive.   A year of therapy, daily doses of Elvanse and a whole lot of self-reflection, I’m up to around 20 hours a week, 6 months into my return.   It’s very hard not to beat myself up. My partner is always so proud of me after a good day or good week in work. He tells me I’m amazing and inspirational. I always felt like he was patronising me and I couldn’t be proud of myself. I couldn’t accept the praise.   I challenged him on it, saying I didn’t understand why he was so proud when he works full time and it’s so easy. He pointed out that my brain makes it very difficult me to do a lot of the things neurotypical people do easily on a daily basis. I’ve had to overcome a lot of obstacles most people never even consider.   The fact that I’ve fought so hard and am STILL fighting is something to be proud of. A year ago, I couldn’t even leave the house most days. All the steps required to leave were just too overwhelming. Now I’m in work most days, showered, wearing clean clothes, even makeup! I’m productive, enjoying my work and feeling positive about the future.   I still struggle to be proud of myself, but I’m getting better. I have so much to be proud of and so do you.   Did you manage to go shower this morning? AWESOME. Made a home cooked meal? YOU ROCK. Lay in bed all day to rest? WELL DONE FOR LOOKING AFTER YOURSELF.   Comparing ourselves to neurotypicals all the time will only make us feel like failures, more overwhelmed and less hopeful.   We face so much more than most every day and we’re still here. Be proud.
