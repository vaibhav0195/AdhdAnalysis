4d27a79b049d2f88826793fdd0b80968e41ac850495f8a45c0db92508716c25d;;;I actually did it! I'm actually gonna graduate!;;;After six (6) years I'm actually gonna get out of this alive with a 2:1 MEng in mechanical engineering! By the skin of my teeth!   There were so many moments when I actually couldn't imagine passing. I got diagnosed in fifth year and started trying meds but tbh I got awful side effects and no real benefits until very recently, along with the pandemic and all kinds of other bullshit ie friends hanging themselves and family bring homophobic, all in all this has been hell and I'm glad it's over and maybe one day I will manage to feel proud of myself WOOOOOOO  how do people survive job hunting help me  Sorry in all seriousness thanks to all you guys on this sub you are my lifeline  edit: oh my gosh thank you so much for the awards! I've never had anything blow up like this before. I'm gonna read every single comment.
