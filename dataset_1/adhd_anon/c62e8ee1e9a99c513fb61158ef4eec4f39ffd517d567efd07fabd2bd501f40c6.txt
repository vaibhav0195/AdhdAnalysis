c62e8ee1e9a99c513fb61158ef4eec4f39ffd517d567efd07fabd2bd501f40c6;;;I’ve never felt more connected to a community of people in 5 seconds or less than I did the moment I opened this sub.;;;Edit: Thank you for the Gold! It’s my first one! I fell asleep accidentally and here I am 5 hours later but I can’t say how much all of your replies mean to me. It’s so nice to hear that I’m not the only one with a game that occasionally crashes.     I (22M) kind of feel lost in life right now. It’s been rough for a long time and no one has really been able to understand how exactly it’s going wrong, including myself. It’s really hard to describe to others how my mind works and really hard to figure out time management and really hard to not feel like I’m literally slipping through time because it can move so quickly or leaving myself notes and alarms and notifications so I can remember basic things.   People I had worked with in the past had slipped comments wondering if I “autistic because I talk so much about random facts” and at a more recent job, a coworker of mine overheard me telling my assistant manager about my fear of running out of time and over the course of getting to know her, noticed my quirks and one day pulled me aside and suggested she thinks I have ADHD and wanted to let me know because we had gotten pretty close. She described her symptoms and what they meant for her and what she’s learned and I cried.   Flash forward to now a couple months later I’m feeling so lost and I remembered that this community might be a thing. I opened this sub and saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/akp6iz/the_contradictory_nature_of_adhd/?st=JRW6DIUS&sh=f5bd58e6) by u/emerald_soleil. I started crying. And then I kept reading. And I keep reading things that people do that I do that my ex was so critical of and I feel less crazy. And I feel like I’ve rambled on but I just wanted to share that it’s nice to know there’s others out there
