Like...yes I've made it this far without a diagnosis but that doesn't mean I haven't struggled? Yes I've done well in classes and I'm thankful I got good grades in undergrad but I was never able to sit down and study, or pay attention in a classroom. I made it through high school doing my homework for my second class in my first class, or studying for my afternoon test during my morning class. I'm honestly still not sure how I did it. Like..no one likes waking up at 2am the day of a test to learn all of the material, I don't just do that for fun?? I don't turn things in a minute before the deadline with subpar or unfinished work because I live for the adrenaline rush?? And when I got to the point where I wasn't doing well anymore I sought out a diagnosis because every way I've tried to cope was working anymore. But I just feel like everyone in my life is confused why "all of a sudden" I have a problem. I try to bring up to non school pieces like how you could never see the floor of my room as a child because it was so messy, or the impulsive/hyperactive tendencies I had that were just deemed part of my personality but it still seems like people just don't understand.
