I (33M) have an ADHD assessment coming up looking for diagnosis.  She said, entirely non-maliciously, "I don't think you have ADHD. I think you just have problems focusing on what you're doing, you zone out all the time whilst I'm talking to you, you don't finish things because you get distracted by something else, and you need constantly reminding to do things even if they're important, and you always leave things to the last minute..." and I was just standing there nodding like "uh huh".  Part of me is worrying that I'm seeking diagnosis as an excuse for being lazy, disorganized, and unmotivated. It was reassuring to hear that someone who lives me thinks I have all the hallmarks, even if the point she ended up making was not the one she meant to.  I thought it was funny, at least
