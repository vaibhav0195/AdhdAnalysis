I wake up in the morning, and after putting it off for nearly 2 weeks, I check my university assignment schedule. Turns out I have an essay due tonight. No problem, I’ll finish it after my History seminar, which finishes at 1pm. After zoning out for the hour and a half history seminar, I realize I should really start doing my essay. 5 youtube videos and 30 minutes on tik tok later, I start doing the essay.  Hyperfocus kicks in. 4 hours goes by in the blink of an eye and i’m about 90% finished the assignment. My essay is 100% done, except for my references page—no biggie, i’ve got time. Here comes the self-congratulations, that sweet release of pure pride knowing you actually managed to get something done even though you had 3 weeks to do it. After the pride comes the thought— “hey, i’ll take a little break. i did just grind for like 4 hours.”  that little break turns into hours before you know it. i kept telling myself to just finish the goddamn references, but i didn’t want to. i just spent my “entire” day writing this essay, gimme a break.  fast forward to finally finishing your references and submitting your essay, only to realize you forgot to put one of the citations on it.  fuck adhd.  Edit: Thank you guys for all the support here! I appreciate the silver, and the bear hug! I love reading your comments and seeing how similar all our lives can be. I’m surprised at how many people are seeing this post considering it’s my first one in this subreddit🤣  Edit 2: I just remembered that I didn't know I had the essay due until I checked my schedule for the first time in a week and a half yesterday morning.
