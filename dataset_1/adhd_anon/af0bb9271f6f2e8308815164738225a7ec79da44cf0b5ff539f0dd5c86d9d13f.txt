After failing (often) I realized that the most effective strategy for me was not to overpower my brain, but to trick it. Thought I’d share my little manifesto here in case it’s helpful for anyone else.   **The Trickster:**  This is not a fight, it is a card game. You are not a warrior, you are a swindler and a trickster. You are here for one reason: **to win the hand**. Sometimes the cards you’re dealt can’t win the hand. You really want to fold. But you don’t have to. Because you have your tricks. And remember – you have **never lost the hand** when you pull off one of your tricks.   **Kyle’s bag of tricks:**  **The Juggle:** Ok Brain, I see you there, trying to procrastinate doing the dishes. Forget about the dishes for now, I have a game for you. It’s a really interesting multi-tasking problem for you to solve: How do I most efficiently do the laundry, pick up the house, make breakfast *and* do the dishes? What’s the optimal order? Which of those things can be ‘going’ while I work on the other?   **The Trump Card:** Oh hi there, Brain – I see you’re gearing up to avoid setting up this doctor appointment. Is that right? Well why don’t we just work on filing our taxes two months in advance instead. Oh man you *really* don’t want to do the taxes huh? I’m feeling a strong distraction pulse from you, Brain. Maybe we don’t do the taxes right now, maybe we just distract ourselves from them. You know what is a good distraction by comparison? Setting up this doctor appointment. Come on, let's avoid those taxes together.   **The Bait and Switch:** Brain, you are getting really worked up. Loads of impulse seeking. Look, let’s just go online and play this game. Just for 5 minutes, ok? You win.                                         [5 minutes pass]  Wait a second, this isn’t a game at all is it? It’s actually that term paper we needed to work on. Surprise! You couldn’t even tell the difference. You just wanted to win, and you forgot to pay attention after that.   **Call the Clock:** Look Brain, you’ve taken too long avoiding this email. I know you don’t want to do it, but I’m going to give you 15 minutes to decide. I’m setting a timer for 15 minutes. At the end, if you want to bail on it, we can bail on it. I promise. In the meantime, I’m just going to start writing it, but I will absolutely stop if you want to when the timer goes off. We can go play video games.   Edit: Thanks for the feedback guys, it really means a lot. We all have unique perspectives and successes to share, so I'll commit to posting more often here!
