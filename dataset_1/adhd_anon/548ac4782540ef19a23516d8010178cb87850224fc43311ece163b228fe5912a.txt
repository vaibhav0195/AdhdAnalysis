548ac4782540ef19a23516d8010178cb87850224fc43311ece163b228fe5912a;;;I just submitted a written exam 1 whole hour before the deadline!;;;I have never done this before.   Yesterday I thought that I wouldn't get to bed before the kids were dropped off this morning,  because I would have to use EVERY single hour available. But I went to bed at 1:30 and just needed to check the references before submitting today.   I am PROUD! Now I only need to finish my Bachelor Thesis, and then I will have finished an education ğŸ˜±ğŸ˜±ğŸ˜±ğŸ˜±ğŸ˜±ğŸ˜± it has taken me 11 years! 3 months ago I thought that it wouldn't happen. 2 months ago I got my diagnose, and in the last 5 weeks I finished 3 exams!  Edit: Oh my god everyone. I had never imagined this post would get this much attention. Thank you everyone.  And I can't help chuckling a bit over the fact that SO many people relates to this, when I believe most neurotypical people would just say "yeah. And so what?" ğŸ˜…
