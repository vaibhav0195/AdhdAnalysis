86ad65f5d493b7e1b0eaea7507f942cebbde0bafb42d13f056f50b514400c32d;;;I told my boss about my adhd diagnosis and it went perfectly;;;Yesterday I decided to quit my job after 3 years. I emailed my letter of resignation stating my diagnosis and how I had to take time to work on myself. I also told my boss that the new store manager was undervaluing me because she took my quietness and chilled out nature as a sign that I had a bad attitude and no enthusiasm to work there.  I thought that was it. Then he called me and seemed very shocked and upset about my reasons for quitting. He said he totally disagreed with the new managers opinion of me and said that I was a solid rock of our store. He then said he didn't want me to have to leave in the middle of a pandemic (noone else is really hiring at the moment) and made a deal with me.  So, I'm now getting 2 months paid leave and then transferring somewhere away from that manager. I'm so shocked with the outcome and my recent diagnosis made me think I was gonna be fucked forever. I don't know why I'm posting here I'm just really happy
