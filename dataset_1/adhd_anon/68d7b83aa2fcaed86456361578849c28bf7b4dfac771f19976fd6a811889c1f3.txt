68d7b83aa2fcaed86456361578849c28bf7b4dfac771f19976fd6a811889c1f3;;;today my health teacher cured me of my adhd;;;i had spoken to my health teacher on how badly i’ve been struggling with my adhd and executive dysfunction issues.  me: so yeah my adhd has been causing me hell lately and it’s only gotten worse under quarantine  teacher: you’ll be alright if you just focus and start your work  holy SHIT. focusing? dear lord, why didn’t i think of such a thing? where have i been all this time?   i understand that she was coming from a good place, but damn that was probably the dumbest thing i’ve heard in quite some time  edit: i do not have high standards, but some teachers definitely should have more knowledge on the students they’re dealing with, especially with ADHD being so common. i think it’s also more so the education system rather than the teachers as individuals
