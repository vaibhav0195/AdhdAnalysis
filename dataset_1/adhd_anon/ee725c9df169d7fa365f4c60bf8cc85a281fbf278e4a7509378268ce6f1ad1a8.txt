This isnâ€™t anything against anybody who was described as gifted!**  Just wanted to acknowledge any of my fellow adhd peeps that **werenâ€™t** recognised as gifted, talented or even that smart as kids.  I did well enough in some things and terrible in others. Average baverage. My adhd is still out here wasting whatever potential I have, even if itâ€™s not much.   Itâ€™s also okay if you donâ€™t have something to help you mitigate that feeling. Weâ€™re all valuable, no matter what we put out in to the world.  â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”-  **Edit**: thanks for the engagement! Just edited to bold â€˜werenâ€™tâ€™ coz I think some people are reading it as â€˜wereâ€™ lol  **Edit 2**: Some of you guys! I know weâ€™re out here being adhd but read the title before you comment, weâ€™re talking about **not** being gifted rn haha, bless yâ€™all. Also thank you for the awards everyone, much appreciated ðŸ’•  **Edit 3**: Itâ€™s been properly amazing to read all your thoughts and I feel a lot of hope for us all. If you fancy a little reading, do give Tolstoyâ€™s very short story â€˜How Much Land Does a Man Needâ€™ a go. It helped put a lot of things in to perspective for me: what you own and achieve in your life wonâ€™t matter when weâ€™ll all end up in ground. Youâ€™ve already done the world a great deal of good just by existing and living with your disability.
