I’m attentive all the damn time.  Having ADHD, you become extremely aware of how often you fuck up. It makes you extremely conscious of avoiding upsetting people. I spend my life feeling like I’m treading on eggshells because of it.  The problem lies here: That list of appropriate actions you consider as common sense? Looks completely different to the list my brain comes up with.  I forget to put away the dishes because I noticed we were out of toilet paper and realised we should buy more. I accidentally broke your glass in the sink because I wanted to clear the kitchen space for you since I know you had a long day and would appreciate a clean space. I forgot our brunch plans because I was too busy shopping for your birthday.  Having ADHD isn’t a lack of care. I care ALL THE FUCKING TIME it’s just that the list of priorities that my brain comes up with are in a different order, and my capacity to run several of those things at once is also a little smaller.  Nothing makes me more upset and depressed than seeing my loved ones upset with me and thinking I don’t care about them. I’m constantly dedicating my mental energy to the people around me - my brain just doesn’t shoot in a way that hits the targets you were expecting them to.  When I ask my loved ones to be really specific about the things they expect of me, I don’t think they truly understand that it’s not me being lazy, it’s me trying my hardest to bring our lists as close together as possible.   I am totally capable of doing those things you want of me - I just need some time to set them in my list as a permanent habit as it doesn’t just occur to me internally.
