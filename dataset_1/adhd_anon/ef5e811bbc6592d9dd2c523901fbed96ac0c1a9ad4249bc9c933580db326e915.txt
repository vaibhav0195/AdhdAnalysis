ef5e811bbc6592d9dd2c523901fbed96ac0c1a9ad4249bc9c933580db326e915;;;I heard someone use the word ‘disability’ regarding ADHD for the first time;;;I’ve always sort of known something was off with myself, I went from being a musically gifted, young, creative person to someone who couldn’t get out of bed in the morning because everything was so much mental effort. I got my official diagnosis at the beginning of this year &amp; have had my ups and downs but am generally doing okay with meds and making good routines for myself.   I recently had a 1-on-1 with one of my managers who also has adhd, and we were talking about how things were going with me (super grateful for this support in the workplace). He reminded me that it’s okay to feel overwhelmed, because I have a disability, and that I should give myself lots of grace. I think it was at that moment that it hit me that my suspicions were true &amp; that I had actually gotten a diagnosis and that something was wrong with me. Something that I CAN manage, but nevertheless, I felt totally sunk. I still haven’t felt ok since. Before my diagnosis, I wanted to figure out what was wrong, but now I just want to pretend it never happened &amp; that my adhd doesn’t exist.   Ugh. I literally just want a month off life to get my shit together.  EDIT: I feel so uplifted by reading the comments right now, thank you to everyone sharing their experiences and knowledge. This community is incredible...such amazing support. Thank u.  With love, a random Canadian. ♥
