f8dd1ca7a155ddcbe678f832ce4291087092e45d70c81a9caac61ea1dd4857fa;;;I need 5 minutes of your time to STOP THE FDA FROM MAKING IT HARDER TO GET ADHD MEDS!;;;Sorry this is very "talking to non-ADHD brains" but I'm copypasta'ing b/c the more comments we get opposing this earlier on the easier it'll be to *STOP THIS*  THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT: PLEASE SHARE! COMMENTS (anyone living in the US can comment!) ARE DUE BY 11/19/19 AT 11:59PM EASTERN!  The FDA is asking for public comment as they consider moving the stimulant market (ritalin, adderall, vyvanse, etc) towards "abuse deterrent formulations." ANYONE who is on these meds or knows someone who is should know IT IS EXTREMELY HARD TO REFILL PRESCRIPTIONS FOR THESE RIGHT NOW. I have hand a PHYSICAL SCRIP to the pharmacist every month (my pharmacy, a nationwide chain, doesn't 'hold' ADHD scrips) & I cannot turn it in MORE THEN A DAY EARLY. I \*also\* MUST be seen by my pdoc every 3 months, but if I get a new one I'll have to go back to EVERY MONTH.  If you follow me you also know the past 3 weeks without my Adderall have been HELL because on top of the PARALYZING executive dysfunction I get MAJORLY DEPRESSED (which is what I was \*originally\* diagnosed with - many adults w/ADHD are, ESP AFAB & FEMMES). (And don't get me started on how executive dysfunction makes remembering things like "date I need to refill" HARD AF.)  Disabled healthcare lawyer & activist Matthew Cortland [wrote up a commenting guide](https://www.patreon.com/posts/31604740).  >"FDA's request for public comment is a preliminary step the agency is taking before it engages in any further action (including formal rulemaking). Submitting a public comment now is your opportunity to ensure FDA knows about your concerns before the regulatory train picks up steam.   >   >The notice leads me to believe that FDA is considering a course of action that could potentially lead to a crack-down on stimulants like ritalin and adderall.    >   >On what basis do I reach this conclusion? Among other factors, FDA's constant invocations in their notice of opioid abuse and their comparison of the regulatory treatment of opioids to stimulants."  &#x200B;  PLEASE COMMENT. Even if it's just \*1\* sentence saying how this is bullshit (not like that though) is better then nothing. It'll take you 5 minutes & will help MILLIONS.  We need to STOP criminalizing NECESSARY MEDICATIONS & THOSE WHO NEED THEM. Chronic pain patients have suffered enough due to the "handling" of opioids, resulting in DEATH. THIS NEEDS TO END. MEDICATION IS MEDICATION!

KEEP COMMENTING! ONLY A FEW HOURS LEFT!
