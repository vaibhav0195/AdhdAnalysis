d44a5b1b4fa4fec77a22c26d165e056c61493b71598bafe550a2a09be8931ec5;;;I've been seeing professional help because I feel like it makes sense for me, but my friend said "why do you want have ADHD so bad?";;;Honestly what I want is help and an accurate diagnosis so I can get that said help.  I felt like it's as if I had a cracked leg and someone said "why do you want the X rays, why do you want a broken foot??"  My issues are still my issues, diagnosis or no diagnosis.   EDIT: Guyyyyyyssss I can't believe all the support. 1.7k??? Thank you for the awards!!! You're all wonderful cupcakes!  (Also title says "want have" and there's a "to" missing, it's annoying me)
