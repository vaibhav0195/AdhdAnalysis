That's how I feel most of the time.  I've recently been diagnosed with ADHD. I've had depression most of my life and long had trouble fitting in.  Now that my workplace is going to Work From Home, there's lots of opening up about how to stay positive, productive, and healthy when so many feel depressed, stir-crazy and anxious.   Across my sector and in the media it's so, so much about mental health and isolation, and I realize this is what it's like when everyone is going through what I and everyone else with depression have been through for so long.  Welcome to the suck, society.
