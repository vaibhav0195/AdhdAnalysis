deb0ef5430aca4e23e4efa1eeb5f17faeb41ba544b0ceb28c897ec35646a8e92;;;I hate arguing with my wife, because I can't remember any specific instance of anything.;;;That's it, really.  I can never "win" arguments with my wife, or even make her acknowledge the merits of what I'm saying because when she says "when have I ever..." I can't remember anything. Ever. Even though I know she's said or done it, probably recently.   Its just really fucking frustrating.   /rant  **Edit: Thanks for all the replies! It's really nice to know that I'm not the only one!**  A few addenda:  First, no, my wife isn't gaslighting me. This isn't something she does maliciously. As I replied to one redditor: my frustration comes less from my wife asking "when..." because in a healthy, and compassionate relationship that's a fair question. It's more from my inability to articulate the "when".  That being said, if you're in a relationship where you believe someone is doing this to you on purpose, that's absolutely not healthy.   Second, yeah, I know no one "wins" an argument, that's why I put it in quotes. I don't run around picking fights with my wife so that I can tally some imaginary scoreboard. Nor does she with me.   Third, I got some really great responses, and I appreciate all the constructive feedback! Yall are awesome. I tried to compile all the various suggestions I got, so here they are:   **Retaining Details:**  /u/msmurasaki You have to get a calendar and then jot down stuff on those days you don't like a certain aspect. Then review them occasionally to help you remember. Also find the source of the problem, not the instance. Use that calendar to find the actual source/pattern that you don't like. E.g. if she says something rude now and then, don't bring up ONE instance. Rather go to the source, which may be 'i find that sometimes you say inconsiderate things, I hope that you can take a Second to think next time before saying stuff that may hurt, and rather be more tactful. If she asks for examples, THEN you bring up the instances in that calendar.  A lot of people suggested keeping some form of notes: journal, phone notes, Gnotes, diary, text screenshots, etc. And just as many people said they feel a little petty or creepy about it to which /u/gonnaquittom said: “If you want to feel less pretty about it you could call it journaling, which it is.”  Several people also suggested discussing the issue immediately if you can.  On the flip side: /u/jcon877 observed that sometimes we need time to gather all the info given to us, piece it all together and form our response. “For me, this can take 1 hour or even a whole day sometimes.”  **Meta-Discussion:**    /u/Slingshotsters brought up the idea of the “metafight.” I really liked the idea, so I’m stealing it. Lots of advice came down to how to have a better conversation with my wife, up to and including having the “meta-fight” discussion, i.e. talking about how we talk about things.  /u/lizzledizzles pointed out that we shouldn’t allow the argument to get bogged down in semantics, which is basically exactly what happens when we start chasing the “when have I ever…” line of reasoning. And /u/WhyAreYouAllHere added to that by pointing out we shouldn’t allow “kitchen sinking,” we should try to understand what we want to talk about and stick as closely to that as possible. If/when that’s not possible, maybe try the argument mapping suggestions. Or, as /u/huckfinn52 said “I stopped trying to remember instances and details and I just focus on remembering my feelings.”   When it comes to talking to our S/O’s more effectively, /u/Yellow_Lemon_Monster suggested providing context. Sometimes they don’t need to know exactly what happened. As /u/crazydevillady pointed out “Even if I don’t remember specifics - I blurt out jumbled pieces. Then for a brief second, I can see it register in his eyes- even when I can’t piece it together.”  For those of us who just aren’t great at talking anyway, /u/sebtaylor01suggested we “don’t talk about it, put it in writing.” I actually have used this method with my wife in the past. We’ll put stuff in an email to initiate a conversation. That allows us to organize our thoughts, and re-read everything, and make sure we’re saying what we want to say. /u/Orangegrapejello pointed out that text and email is also be useful for relationships that aren’t on great terms (ex’s, estranged family, etc)  /u/reluctantlyvegan said we should learn to “accept the stalemate.” Sometimes the best we can do is to make our point as best as we can and hope that our S/O will understand us after they’ve had some time to process.  **Argument Mapping:**  /u/OliviaParamour “when I get into a serious argument/discussion, what I try to do is: Take a piece of paper and draw a line. a timeline from the start of the argument to the end of the argument (i assume 1 hour) And then I draw lines coming out of that lines when points are made by either of us. If we go down a branch of an argument, then I draw a line of that line and continue it.”  **Active Listening:**  If our S/O’s initiate the conversation (or even if they didn’t) /u/elciteeve noted that “it's important to actively listen... Make sure you understand them and validate their feelings (which doesn't mean just Agreeing with their point.) I think especially for adhd people it's easy to instantly go into full rejection mode and either shut down, get defensive, or whatever other non-helpful strategy we learn as kids.  Remember that by actively listening and asking for clarification, then validating their feelings, you might realise you interpreted their meaning wrong at first. Which is how many arguments turn heated so quickly.”  /u/NettingStick suggested “radical honesty. If anything’s bugging us, we bring it up immediately and neither of us treats it as some sort of personal attack or failing.” This isn’t for the faint of heart, though.   **Side note:**  Finally, /u/jonnierod offered some valuable insight into the reliability of working memory generally: “I used to do investigations at work and one thing I learned is that when you hold anybody's memory up to the harsh light of evidence no one has a good memory. No one. I never interviewed a person who didn't at one point or another have to amend their statement as more evidence was presented. I'm not saying they were lying, I'm just saying when people start having to verify what they know we all fold like lawn chairs.”  Thanks again everyone!  Edit 2: Ran across this article that gave some useful specific suggestions for communicating with your SO, so I thought I add it here. https://twodrifters.us/blog/couples-communication-exercises.html
