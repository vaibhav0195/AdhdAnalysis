Looking from their side it may look like I am angry without a cause.  Let’s imagine the same situation, from two different perspectives:  My girlfriend is entering the room and she sees me siting in front of my computer. browsing my phone with one hand, and pen-spinning with the other hand. She starts asking question:  &#x200B;  **My GF:** Hey honey, can you please…….  **Me:** FOR CHRIST’S SAKE! NOT NOW! I AM TRYING TO WORK HERE!  **My GF:** What is wrong with you?!?!  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  And yeah, from her perspective it may be seen as a blast of anger for no reason. But looking on what is happening inside my head is making this a bit different…  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  ***Brain***: Hey whatcha doin'?  **Me:** I am trying to work.  ***Brain:*** *Booooooooooring!*  ***Brain:*** *Check you phone.*  **Me:** What?  ***Brain***: Check you phone. Now.  **Me:** Why? I am really trying to work here..  ***Brain:*** *We’re low on dopamine, check your phone.*  **Me:** I am working!  ***Brain:*** *CHECK YOUR PHONE! How can you know if there isn’t something interesting? We are low on dopamine, remember? Every stimulus counts in this type of situation!*  **Me:** …  ***Brain:*** *What kind of strings are used in banjos?*  **Me:** What??  ***Brain:*** *Is it the same type as in guitars?*  ***Brain:*** *Or different?*  ***Brain:*** *We should check it now.*  ***Brain:*** *Go on, google it.*  **Me:** I am really trying to work! Not now!  ***Brain:*** *Heeeeeey, you know what? We should learn how to play banjo! Google how much does it cost to buy a banjo.*  **Me:** I will not spend any more money on a next hobby, that I will abandon in 10 minutes.  ***Brain:*** *We won’t abandon it. We will become world-famous bluegrass musician. I am sure.*  **Me:** Nope.  **Me:** And be silent now, I am trying to focus.  ***Brain:*** *♬ huummmmhummmhummmmmmmhmmmhmmmmhuuuuhmmmm ♫*  **Me:** Shut up.  ***Brain:*** *♬ WEEEEST VIRGINIAAAAAAAAAAA! ♬*  ***Brain:*** *♬ MOUTAIN MAMAAAAAA! ♬*  **Me:**  Shut up!!!  ***Brain:*** *♬ TAKE MEE ♬*  ***Brain:*** *♬ HOMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!! ♬*  **Me**: WILL YOU BE QUIET FOR FIVE MINUTES?  ***Brain:*** *Nope, I’m bored.*  ***Brain:*** *Stop doing this boring stuff!*  ***Brain:*** *We can do it later!*  **Me:** Yeeeeeeeah sure, but when?  ***Brain:*** *LATER!*  ***Brain:*** *I’ve literally just said it!*  ***Brain:*** *Jeeez, man… are you even listening to me?*  ***Brain:*** *What’s wrong with you?*  ***Brain:*** *You need to focus man!*  **Me:** SHUT UP!  ***Brain:*** *DON’T TELL ME WHAT TO DO!*  ***Brain:*** *I AM THE ONE IN CHARGE HERE!*  ***Brain:*** *YOU WILL NOW ABORT WHATEVER TASK YOU ARE DOING AND YOU WILL GO FOR A QUEST OF FINDING QUICK DOPAMINE SOURCES!*  **Me:** SHUT UP!!!!! I NEEED TO FINISH IT NOOOOOOW!  ***Brain:*** *CHECK YOUR PHONE FIRST!*  &#x200B;  **My GF:** Hey honey, can you please…….  **Me:** FOR CHRIST’S SAKE! NOT NOW! I AM TRYING TO WORK HERE!  **My GF:** What is wrong with you?!?!  &#x200B;  **Me:** Are you happy with what you have done?  ***Brain:*** *Naaaah* *don’t careeeee…*  ***Brain:*** *We’re still low on dopamine though....*  ***Brain:*** *Can you check how old John Denver was when he learned how to play guitar?*  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  It is like a constant battle in my head, so hard to explain to other people...        EDIT:  **I am finding it hilarious that actually many of you went google how old John Denver was when he learned how to play guitar :D**     And also just to clarify - yes, I know the only person here to blame is myself. Not my girlfriend, not the ADHD itself. But understanding ADHD after being diagnosed finally  allowed me to work on my behaviour in a proper way
