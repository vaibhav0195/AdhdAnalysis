107a151e46f2e1e1842d0fcdf655c867b83bde7a4b575cd16487e5e09d25d5a1;;;told my boss about time-blindness;;;This week, my boss asked everyone on our team to estimate the percent of time we spend on each of our projects.  But I have no idea.  So yesterday, I met with my boss, and confessed that I had no idea.  I suggested that I could dig through virtual meeting records to add up time, etc.  But that, off-handed, I just couldn’t give an accurate answer.  I told him that I recently learned about a symptom of ADHD called “time-blindness,” and that it probably contributes to why I struggle to estimate project timelines.  His reaction?  “Wow.  I’ve never had to think about my time like that.  I’ve taken it for granted my whole life.”  And then he reassured me that he only needed my “best guess,” and helped me estimate my biggest project.  EDIT:  Wow!  Any mods (or bots or experts) out there who can add a definition and example of time-blindness to this post?    A lot of folks have reached out, and I’m sure this community has a vetted answer that we can share.
