They'll then message you privately and show a keen interest in you and your story.  Generally they're a little TOO interested for a total stranger who messaged you out of the blue.  They will spend some time exchanging messages with you, try to form some kind of sympathetic bond with you, then eventually you'll get a message like this:  " yknow if youre looking for a therapist, im not a therapist, but i would  be a “life coach” (ie an unlicensed therapist) if you want for whatever  your copay would normally be. I am actually interested to hear more  about your life and experience and to talk with you about your problems. "  This is a scam.  I recently got contacted by one of these people and found it strange how he was SO interested in my life and my problems, but never seemed to want to talk about any of his own.  In my public posts, I'd made it clear that I am destitute, so I didn't suspect somebody looking to scam me for money at first, thus I continued my correspondence for a while longer until eventually I got the above message.    There are predators out there, and they look for vulnerable people looking for answers to prey upon.  DON'T fall for it!  If you really think you need a "life coach", find somebody reputable.  Don't fall for this kind of trap.
