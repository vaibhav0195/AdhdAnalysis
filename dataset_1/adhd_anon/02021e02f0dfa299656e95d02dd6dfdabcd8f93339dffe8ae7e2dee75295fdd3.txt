I want to scream. I feel like i’m so broken i can’t be fixed. I started Adderall a few days ago and it’s not making any difference. I’m scared that i’m a lost cause. I’m scared that i can’t be fixed. I’ve been living with this for so long without any treatment and i realized only a few months ago how much it contributes to my depression. I just hate it so much and I feel like no one realizes how hard it is.   Edit:  Hi i really didn’t expect so many responses to this. I probably won’t be able to answer them all but thank you so much to everyone for the support and advice. This is a really great community, i posted this on a whim and i’m glad I did.  Also just to clarify some things/add context: I’m in an inpatient unit currently, have been for about two weeks. Yes i’m allowed to have my phone, this particular unit is pretty lenient about it, we just can’t take pictures. I’ve started a few meds while here - Wellbutrin (for depression and adhd), gabapentin (for GAD), naltrexone (this one’s kind of an experiment... doctors said it may help with my dermatillomania), and the Adderall. In addition to all that I’ve been doing ECT. So there’s a lot that i’m monitoring right now. So far the only big difference i’ve noticed is my mood is generally better and suicidal thoughts are much less prevalent. I think the ECT is helping with that. But anxiety and adhd are still fucking me over just as much as usual.
