535e26eec243a142b5e8ce98bcb21c2f578911b636554999d4f5262dd7f7993b;;;i got accepted into every college i applied to!;;;tldr: struggled getting any help for my adhd bc of my in denial parents but finally got through high school   this is the most proud of myself i’ve felt in years. after basically being told by my parents all of high school and junior high that i would never be smart enough or good enough to be accepted anywhere, i worked as hard as i could to prove that wrong. i struggled quite a lot. despite getting an adhd diagnosis, my parents pretended as if it never happened. they continued to tell me i was just dumb and lazy and never bothered to help me control a literal disorder. i don’t know what it’s like to be on meds since my parents didn’t allow me to but hopefully i can look into it when i’m a little older. anyways, that’s really it. i feel actually proud and accomplished for once and i’m gonna b annoying ab it :,)  edit: wow,, i’m shocked at the amount of engagement this received! i’m grateful and thankful for every comment/award and i’m reading them all + trying to reply to them all as well. i’m so happy that this is motivational or encouraging to so many of you. its quite late where i am so i will retire to bed. i want to reply to everyone tomorrow when i have the chance! thank you all again, it feels amazing to be able to celebrate this with so many other people
