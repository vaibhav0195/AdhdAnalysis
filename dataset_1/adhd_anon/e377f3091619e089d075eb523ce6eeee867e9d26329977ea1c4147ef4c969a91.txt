When I went to my doctor to get tested, to my surprise she let me know that I had been diagnosed with ADHD when I was six years old. Twenty one years ago.   I called my mom, and she said something to the effect of "oh yeah, but you figured it out." I called my dad and he told me I was going to become a drug addict if I took anything for it.   I got on medication, and for the first time in my life it feels like I'm not fighting against myself constantly. I feel like all the coping mechanisms I've learned are actually getting me ahead, instead of helping me to bail water out of a boat with a giant hole in it.   I can't keep myself from thinking about all the times I was grounded and yelled at for poor time management, for not doing my homework, for not paying attention, and for my stuff being a mess. I keep thinking about all the trouble I had in school, and in college, and in work. And I keep thinking about how my parents knew why it was happening, and instead of helping me, just got mad that I dared to display symptoms of something I didn't even know I had. I thought there was something irreversibly wrong with me for twenty one years, and no one said anything.   I struggled for years and they just watched me, and punished me for the symptoms while they hid the root cause from me.  And I'm mad.
