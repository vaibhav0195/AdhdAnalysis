57d386115c2a8bc81c4404b40f158d5295dc906870b59d796e7990b5bf3b48e2;;;My boyfriend who was skeptical of my ADHD diagnosis at first, sat down with me yesterday and read through the articles that I shared with him and spent time asking me nonjudgemental questions about my experience with ADHD. It felt really nice to feel heard.;;;My (27f) boyfriend (30m) has always been more skeptical about ADHD, especially about medicating for it. When I first was going to get the diagnosis, he said, "I think if it was me, I'd just ignore it because it doesn't seem like that big of a deal." Obviously, this was really frustrating. But I talked with him about how this is really important for me to feel supported in, and he agreed, and he has started reading up about it and has been really curious about what my experience is like.  He's also supporting my decision to pursue medication which is good too.
