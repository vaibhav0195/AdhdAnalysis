This means banned from doing any other activities; watching movies, seeing friends, going to the protest today, even shopping, cleaning my room, sorting out bills and life admin.  I keep saying to myself; you are not allowed anything until you've made serious headway with your work. It is two days work, after that is over you can do everything else.  This has been going on a month and i'm at my wits end (plus had no social life and living in a pigsty). The one thing i keep up with is exercise but i'd rather be doing it mid afternoon and end up running 11pm at night (not ideal) because i keep saying i've got to work before i do it.   Any recommendations of what to do? I am seriously destroyed at this point. I just need to do this work. All i am doing is spending all day in bed hating myself pretty much day after day.
