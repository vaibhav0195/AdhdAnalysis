e8f08721589c08306ebf812ab023039eb404d63cd094e524bf628fdf4ab2c9fe;;;For everyone who has to deal with folk that are saying everyone has adhd;;;This one is for you!  Adhd symptoms compared people who don't have adhd https://imgur.com/gallery/ugNr8rB  I don't know if this is allowed, all credit should go to russel Barkley. Buy his book if you want to know more. I am not affiliated. Not advertising just crediting. I don't even know if am allowed to post this in this manner.  Extra edit: The everyone has adhd myth https://imgur.com/gallery/kORx7uJ  Edit for sources: Barkley gives the dsm-5 for 9 of the biggest symptoms, and the other are based on thousands of studies but 2 of them come from him and a Colleguea.  1. Study followed children with adhd into adulthood. 2. Was a study that looked at adults who referred them selves to his clinic And ended up with adhd. He compared those with two other groups of adults ; a group of patients being treated for other disorders and a Group in the general population (who had not been diagnosed with any psychiatric disorder.     Edit:I've found the sample size. I quote:  >'My colleagues and I recently published a book containing a study in wich which we asked 146 adults diagnosed with adhd and 109 adults from a general community sample to tell us where they had experienced the 18 dsm symptoms often.   Under that he shows a table with official dsm 5 symptoms for adhd. The other symptoms they based on their own research wich can be found in the source below.   More info about these studies can be found here: Barkley, R. A., Murphy, K, R., & Fischer, M. (2008). *ADHD in adults: what the science says*. New York: guilford press.  Edit: do note, this is **NOT** a checklist but rather a list of known and researched symptoms. This post is not meant to self diagnose, although it can help with it. If you do please ask your Doc. Or get the book. Don't take it from me or some out of context pages. Proper help is key. We on reddit are only supports but not the help itself.  Edit: as some folk are asking for sources or questions that I can't answer here are the non affiliated links:   [taking charge of adult adhd](https://www.amazon.com/Taking-Charge-Adult-Russell-Barkley/dp/1606233386)   [adhd in adults: what the science says](https://www.amazon.com/ADHD-Adults-What-Science-Says/dp/1609180755)  Edit: did not expect this to explode this much. I try to get at every one. No guarantees though.
