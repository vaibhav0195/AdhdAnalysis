Just someone struggling with ADHD, trying to find ways to cope with it. So like with any advice, please take this with a grain of salt. Do it yourself, if you're feeling like you're losing sense of yourself, Stop it. You're doing it wrong. If done right, this should feel like meditating.**  Edit : Holy Fuck! my inbox exploded! Oh man I'm crying. I'm so happy that you used this and actually accomplished something. Thank you for all the awards.  # tl:drs at the bottom of the post. And read the large texts  # 1. Method  Yup. Switch to 3rd person. visualize yourself from behind, like in a game. This really helped me to start studying when I didn't feel like it, the past 2 days. And it seems promising. And whenever your attention shifts to something else (which is, for most of us every 2 fucking seconds) switch to 3rd person. Hell! Always be in 3rd person mode. When you're having an emotional breakdown, or when you're trying to make a life-changing decision (where most of us have a bit of a hard time) don't refer to yourself as "You". Refer yourself in your name. For example, "Oh yeah. Now I'm typing out a reddit post about how to get shit done using the new trick I've found while the shit needed to be done using the new trick I've found rots. I should get back to work", should be changed to "Bruce is typing a reddit post advising his fellow ADHDers about how to get shit done using the new trick he found while the shit needed to be done using the new trick he found rots. He should get back to work". See how drastically it changes our viewpoint? It feels like I'm in a movie or a videogame, fighting against villains such as distraction, Anger, negative self talk, for my life. Just like Batma..Whoops. Bruce Wayne. And it sounds cool as hell. Try this out friends.  Edit : I had some more things in mind to say but I forgot it so fuck it. have a nice day y'all. Batman out!  Edit 2 : Whoa! didn't expect this so many responses. Thank you all and Thanks for the Award kind anonymous redditor. So while replying to a comment, I think I figured out why this works so well. So here is my two cents.  # 2.Why this works?  The way I understand it, it's because when we use words like "you" "we" or our name to address ourselves instead of using "me", We detach ourselves from... well, ourselves. As ADHDers, most of us have high failures to success ratio. So our past experiences about failing is more prominent. So when we try to do something, We can not overcome the resistance because we already know the outcome. It's already hard for us to find motivation and focus to do a task, and those experiences make it even worse. So when we're addressing ourselves to something other than "I", we break out of that barrier that is made out of negative memories. Because we didn't see the struggles of Elon Musk right? We only saw this highly successful person, at **that moment.** If you see someone who is rich, have a nice job, have a beautiful girlfriend, you don't see what he's done to get to that place. We only see the outcome. And when we see ourselves in the same lens we used to see that stranger, wehave someone we saw just **now**. A perfect pile of clay, to mold into anyone we want. Sure, this won't fix the physiology of our brains, But it'll at least help us to reduce the everyday toll we take because of it, by countering it. it's like wearing a powered Exoskeleton to fight a physically superior threat, or Having a symbiote to help us survive, like Venom.  Hell! we can switch between 3rd person gaming and being with a Symbiote!  &#x200B;  # Isn't this just Dissociation?  No. See, Dissociation is feeling disconnected from your thoughts, feelings, memories, and surroundings. But this is the complete opposite of dissociation. You're not leaving yourself. You're **observing** yourself from a 3rd person perspective. It's like watching a friend getting angry, cry, procrastinate, or whatever. You're not gonna blame him, are you? But at the same time, You won't take it as personal as when you're going through the same things yourself. You're fully aware of the situation, but you're not reacting as hard as you could be. Now you're not blaming yourself for having these thoughts. Or for not doing anything for the past 3 days except laying in the bed paralyzed. It's **"Observing yourself made fun".**  Disassociation is what happens when you're on autopilot. This method forces you to stay aware. It's hard I know. But when you're repeatedly associating looking at yourself specifically in a 3rd person perspective, similar to a videogame, while you're walking, talking, doing chores whatever, and refer to yourself by your name, You're forced to be aware of yourself. It's like walking meditation without actually feeling like meditating.(We hate to meditate right?)  &#x200B;  **tl:dr - method :**  You can view yourself or think of yourself in third person perspective, to be more aware of your emotions, surroundings and your ;as they say ;'lAzInEsS' (Agh Fuck that word. But I couldn't find a better way to describe it)  **tl;dr - why this works? ;**  Well, it's a form of meditation. You're seeing yourself from an observer's perspective. You're observing all of your emotions for what it is. Like in a videogame. You're seeing all your player's emotions, What he's **Not doing,** What holds him back without being judgemental.  **tl:dr - Isn't this just dissociation? :** No. This is the complete opposite of dissociation. When you dissociate, you don't see yourself. You're being mindless. Like playing the game without an objective. without a mission. Blindfolded. With this method, you have to force yourself and always bring your attention back to yourself, or behind the head of yourself. It's like meditation without feeling like we're meditating.  Edit : 4  **Core;**  This is almost like an all day meditation without feeling like meditating. As people with ADHD, our main problem with meditation is most of the time, we can't stick to it. Seeing myself in 3rd person feels like always being aware of myself through someone else's eyes. Same thing as meditation, But because of the added videogame effect, we can actually reward ourselves while being self-aware. That's how I see it.
