My roommate even gets upset because he will send me memes and i, somehow, have gotten so inattentive that I block the notification entirely. I have Facebook messages sitting in my inbox from good friends just asking how I’m doing. They’ve been there over a week. It gives me so much guilt because i don’t understand why it’s so challenging for me to just... start a conversation? Does anyone else have this issue?  It feels like the gears of my brain are permanently stuck and I can move neither forward or backward. I just stare at the wall all day.
