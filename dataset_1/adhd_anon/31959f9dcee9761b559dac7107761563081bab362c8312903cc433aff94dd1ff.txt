I can’t function better. I can’t ever get any support from the people around me because they don’t know jack shit about mental disorders. I am aching so so much yet no one sees that, I am so broken and I find no solace anywhere, I feel so incredibly ashamed of myself and how fucking slow and stupid I am, and the society too makes me feel this way. I feel so guilty for zoning out, feel guilty for not being able to do basic things. I need help so bad, I brain is so horribly fogged, i am not able to pull myself out of this rut, and I am not able to function, I’m a student and I find it very difficult to stay focused, and because of this I’m not able to achieve my goals, which in turn leads me to scoring badly in my exams, and since I’m from an Asian country, I get horribly criticised for not being able to do well in exams. I really really hate being alive, because my life is all about fighting myself and the world as well, I’m only battling with everything, I’m only experiencing the bitterness of life. I honestly wish I wasn’t born at all, cause from my experiences I’m pretty sure, that the world doesn’t need people like me. The slow, inefficient, the ill, the weak, the INCOMPETENT. My incompetence is my problem and I have to suffer with it all my life. The pain and struggle is mine and mine alone. I really wish life could end asap, I’m very tired.
