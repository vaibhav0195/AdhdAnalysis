Just because my mom gave me a list with steps when I was little.;;;I get overwhelmed from any type of work ALL the time. Paper? Too much to process, I don't know where to start, so I don't do it. Study? I don't even know what to look at first. The list can go on.  But there's one rare experience I have where my ADHD actually doesn't get in the way! Cleaning my room! Which is so weird because I hear its one of those overwhelming exhausting tasks for most people here.  But the only reason I am this way, is because when I was about 7, my mom gave me a list of 4 simple things and put it on my wall.  It said "1. Pick up clothes.  2. Put away toys.  3. Make bed  4. Put up books."  And the second I got that list it changed everything.  It was no longer just a messy room, it was a set of 4 small tasks.  I never ever had trouble with my room after that.  I just think this is really funny to look at.  It shows us that some of our most difficult frustrating tasks are only difficult because we're given it in the wrong way. **Think about if the world wasn't designed for neurotypical brains.   If we all were just given the same task, but a little differently in the way we're given it.**  We could do *so* much.  Everyone here has struggled with being given some task that their brain can't process because it simply because it was given the neurotypical way.  Our brains are trying. We're trying *so* hard.  And maybe if we can find our equivalent of a "clean your room" list, or other ways to cope with our different brains, people will see that we do in fact try.  Edit: I've never gotten award before this is cool. Thank you kind stranger. Also speaking of overwhelming, I always read every comment on my post but now... idk what I'm gonna do.
