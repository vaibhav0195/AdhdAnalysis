I have a lot of guilt around my peers who also have ADHD and have different, more impactful effects, and sometimes feel like I faked my symptoms accidentally, even though my logical side is screaming at me that it’s not possible. I also have tics that started presenting a couple years ago (who knew that was an underdiscussed symptom??????) so I find myself thinking “maybe Im just neurologically messed up and its not ADHD” even though a neurologist signed off that Im healthy besides those. It’s hard because my parents definitely don’t believe in it and I also find myself invalidating my ADHD out of pressure from them. Does anyone else deal with this? I feel like getting a diagnosis as an adult just comes with a weird mental toll, at least for me, even though it also provides a lot of relief.
