0e13ed5b29f921876057f437343236f72695846a8fa77ec18fb55a72f0eca0ba;;;FUCK a bitch named executive dysfunction;;;"You have work You have work Get up Get up Get up Hey, Get up you have work GET UP YOU HAVE WORK" is all i hear inside my head while i'm laying on my bed staring at the ceiling while having 5+ assignments due in the next three hours. Why can't I just do my work? Why does it take me longer to THINK about doing my work rather than actually DOING it? Why can my friends finish their work in two hours? Why can't I do that? And man don't even get me started on online school. the zoom meetings are not beneficial to me, reading isn't either, everything goes in one ear and out the other, words never get absorbed. I hate having ADD and the struggles that it comes with.  Edit: thank you so much for all of the kind comments. It makes me feel SO much better that other people can relate to this because I don't have anyone to talk to about this (or at least people who will understand this).  I currently have been off medication since May, and i'm very hesitant to take it again. After not taking it for a few days or even a week, I will get terrible migraines taking it again. So I really can't imagine how bad the pain will be after not taking it for about 6 months. My medication also doesn't make me feel so well throughout the day taking it (dry mouth, which results in bad breath, sweating, very fast heart beat, upset stomach, no appetite) but I think i'm willing to feel uncomfortable for 8hrs a day instead of failing my junior year of high school.
