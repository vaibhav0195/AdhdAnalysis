67c0cfa97b45007729fca4c0d73e2000a41423fc7de4886fca72a8cf6a5b879c;;;As of 2008, 5% of college students w/ ADHD graduate -- and this May I am one of them!!!;;;Just wanted to brag here because I don't want to make a big deal about it on my personal social media... But going to a really "good" college and succeeding in four years, despite not having been diagnosed nor medicated properly until SENIOR FALL, is a huge win for me. I often struggle with feeling I'm not capable, or good enough, because of my poor attention skills and slack work ethic (or whatever). The fact that I was able to complete my degree is insane to me. So many all-nighters and last minute projects.. Terrible attendance and tardiness... A fucking pandemic... Dealing with depression, and anxiety, and grieving.. Financial stress.. Family issues.. ADHD, which affects each one of these factors.. I'm super proud of myself today.  &#x200B;  EDIT: Statistic from study posted in comments. Not sure about the accuracy of the info because I didn't research in-depth, but take it with a grain of salt.
