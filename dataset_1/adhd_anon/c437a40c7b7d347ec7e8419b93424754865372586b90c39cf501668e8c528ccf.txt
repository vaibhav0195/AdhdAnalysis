You can think of success in life like a club we're all trying to get into. Most people will go in the front door. They stand in line, wait their turn, and work their way forward slowly but surely. A select number of exclusive people get to use the back door, the are the people who know the right person, have the right reputation, or could buy their way in. But some people can't get in through the front or the back door, they need "the third door"  The third door is the unmarked way in. It's a window, a fire escape, a roof exit. It's hiding in the laundry cart when they bring in the linens or disguising yourself and going in the service entrance. It's a combination of timing, ingenuity, and effort, but you can keep trying until you make it in.   I often need to remind myself that my route to success is different, but that doesn't make it any less real. The whole concept of "run your own race" has been reiterated to me so many times but I find it hard to stop comparing my path to others. I have to remind myself: just keep trying things, never stop innovating ways around your problems, fall down nine times and stand up ten. I think I feel my best when I'm in "lovable rogue" mode, because I know I don't feel good (at all!!!) when I'm in "trying to be normal" mode.   Find your third door, people.   And remember, if you get into "the club" - you aren't a fraud, you deserve to be there just as much as anybody else.  EDIT: Holy moly this resonated! Please everybody keep sharing your stories and experiences. Maybe we all need to see/remember the breadth of possibility that's truly out there.  EDIT: Thank you /u/23wings for the original source! It's a book, Third Door by Alex Banayan.
