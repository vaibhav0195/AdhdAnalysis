Went through the drive through, get to the window to pay, reach for my wallet in my back pocket, no wallet.     I momentarily panic, then I remember, Apple Pay!  I don’t know how to use Apple Pay. Luckily the girl working the window did, we get it figured out. She hands me back my phone, I feel like I handled the crisis well. I found a solution without panicking and just giving up.      Then I look down, there between my legs, is my wallet. This is where I always put my wallet when I go through the drive through so I’m not reaching for it at the window. I always put it there, yet somehow completely spaced and forgot.  My brain then goes from that feeling of accomplishment, to feelings of annoyance.  I laughed about it with my fiancé later, but still... wtf brain.
