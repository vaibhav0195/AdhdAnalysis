47038d5f969e3912a1e7852996954f81f6ca4be4dc6a024aa287532df3f8e03f;;;My hyperfocus took over and I accidentally spent FOUR HOURS reading about “feral humans”.;;;That’s right. Feral humans. Wtf lol. People who were raised by animals in the wild. Wikipedia took me away and I kept reading one case after another. Finally came out of it and realized I am so dehydrated, my back hurts, i really have to pee, and I’m hungry.   I didn’t even mean to do it... and I have no idea what even triggered the thought that lead me there.   I don’t know why my hyperfocus can’t be triggered about things I ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT. Can people even control their hyperfocus or are we all merely slaves to its whims?   Lmao....happy Sunday, everyone. Hope you aren’t spending it down weird internet holes like me!  Edit: i love all the responses about you guys getting taken away by the same topic! I love this sub, and you guys. 💕 [Here’s ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral_child?wprov=sfti1)  a link to start if anyone has spare time. Don’t click if you don’t have at least an hour to dedicate to it lol!
