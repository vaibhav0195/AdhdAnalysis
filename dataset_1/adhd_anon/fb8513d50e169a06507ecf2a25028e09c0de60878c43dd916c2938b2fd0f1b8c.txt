After studying for 10 years, and going undiagnosed for 9,5 years of it, finishing something like this is something I never thought was possible.   The last days were depressing because I thought I would have failed my thesis. Normally people were not really invested in my performance, but this being the last part, I was afraid I would have let so many people down again.  For all my fellow ADHD’ers here, don’t give up! Even when it takes so much longer than others. Together, we are getting there eventually! ❤️  Love  Update: Wow guys, I thought a casual 40 upvotes would have already been nice. This amazing response from this group is giving me such an incredible thankful feeling! I will do my best to respond to everyone. ❤️  For who wanted to know: I studied Media and Information at the University of Amsterdam with New Media and Digital Culture as specialization. My thesis title was “YouTube with the trump card in hand?”, where I analyzed the presence of filter bubbles in the YouTube recommendation system when looking for information on the 2020 US presidential election, therefore possibly affecting voting behavior.
