I'm a college student and its 4:34am and I'm up because I'm SUPPOSED to be doing homework for my class tomorrow but I streamed and watched videos for the past 6 hours. I always stay up late because I feel like I COULD do something at the late hours of the night but I never do and I just end up going to sleep feeling like shit. I was wondering if other people relate to this weird feeling to purposely avoiding sleep for no real reason. 〒▽〒
