They're taking this medication that we are prescribed so that we can live our lives and use it as mental steroids.   Every time this makes the news, it always feels like it gives people with adhd who have to medicate a bad name by proxy. Never mind that this stuff probably literally saved my life in high school, I'm just another AP junkie with a pill bottle in my hand.  EDIT: I did not know this would get so huge. I've been seeing a lot of great discussion on this thread, but I'd also like to  1) remind people to be civil (already had to report someone) and 2) ask what people mean by "gatekeeping," because I'm seeing that comment a lot and have no idea what it means.
