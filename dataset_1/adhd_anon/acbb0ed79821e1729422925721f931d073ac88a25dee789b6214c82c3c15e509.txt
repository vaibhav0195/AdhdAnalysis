acbb0ed79821e1729422925721f931d073ac88a25dee789b6214c82c3c15e509;;;Dr. Russell Barkley's excellent 2.5 hour lecture "30 Essential Ideas you should know about ADHD" - but broken down into 5-10min segments so you can actually get through it.;;;I found this version AFTER already forcing myself to watch the 2.5hr version- wish i'd found it first. Anyway, i'm sure some of you can benefit from this. Russell's videos are some of the most cogent and insightful information available on the subject that i have found. Hope this will help make it more accessible to some of you.  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzBixSjmbc8eFl6UX5_wWGP8i0mAs-cvY
