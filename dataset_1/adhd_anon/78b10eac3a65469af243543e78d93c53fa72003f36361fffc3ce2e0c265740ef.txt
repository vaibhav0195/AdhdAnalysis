I hadn't replied in a day or 2 and she followed up saying "I realise that was a lot so here is a summary that you can reply to instead".  It is such an insanely thoughtful and empathetic thing to do and I love her. I don't think she's researched that or done it because of ADHD, she's done it because she just knows and gets me and doesn't see anything I need as a disorder or a problem.  I am smug as all hell because I have such an awesome friend, but I'm also sharing because this is actually a great workaround. I now feel able to read the long message because I know I only need to actually think about her 4 bullet points when I reply. I thought that could be useful to others.
