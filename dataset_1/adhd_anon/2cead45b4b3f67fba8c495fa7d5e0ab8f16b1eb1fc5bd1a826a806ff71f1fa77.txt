And I wish people didn’t get so offended by it.;;;So I’m pregnant, ADHD. No meds atm because of the pregnancy and I’m finding it verrry hard to socialize and keep in touch with everyone. Specifically long distance friendships/family and people I don’t talk to daily. People really come out of the woodwork when you’re pregnant too! Like old co-workers, my sisters friends, old neighbors even! I will just find it too much of a task to answer the check-up texts of “hey!! How are you doing momma?”   I began with giving delayed responses that were short and polite, to just not texting back. When I don’t text back I get them saying they’re worried about me and one lady actually showed up at my house! Another friend contacted my mom through Facebook asking am I okay because she hasn’t heard from me. I am fine!  And then you get the people that are offended and say something along the lines of -sorry I’m “overwhelming” or “bothering” you.  I talk with my husband and I have two close friends I text all the time that require minimal effort. I’m Also very close with my mom we talk every day. But it’s these long term, long distant friends that I find takes way too much effort to keep in touch with them all! It’s so frustrating because they actually get mad at me for it! Then I get mad at them but I don’t think they understand the effort and anxiety it takes for me to keep everybody updated and in the loop nor do I have a huge desire to. I never completely understood the social effects of ADHD but I assume that is what I am experiencing.   I feel keeping in touch with people was so much easier and enjoyable when I was on meds.
