Not because we ever fall out or anything I just don't text back and don't make an effort to hang out often enough so we end up drifting. If I don't see someone regularly like through work or college or through my partner then I cannot maintain a friendship. The last few years my only friends have been those of my partners and as soon as I break up with someone I never see their friends again because I can't make an effort to maintain things.  I want friends so bad but its so hard for me, even if get the impulse to text a friend, once they text back a few times my interest has twinddled and I leave them on read or don't even open it and I feel so bad because I know I'm being a shitty friend.  If I make plans to hang out with someone by the time it comes around I don't wanna go out and I cancel.  Does anyone else do this?
