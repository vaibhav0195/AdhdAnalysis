You can't get started on something because your brain's going a mile a minute, and the thought of having to discipline your thinking produces a wave of dread that can quickly overwhelm you. I get it; it's a regular thing for me, and probably for most people on this thread.  But less attention is paid (no pun intended) to the long-term paralysis that can result from ADHD: when you're unable to plan for the future because your interests are in a constant state of flux. In order to make progress we need to commit to goals, and in order to commit to goals we need a baseline level of emotional stability ... but ADHD can remove that stability. It can make you feel like disaster is perpetually imminent, so your struggle to avert disaster becomes the only objective you have time for.  Over time this can really knock your self-confidence. The irony of having ADHD is that I'm open-minded but incredibly short-sighted. I take things one week at a time, and my primary objective at any given moment is simply to 'keep it together'.  Does this sound familiar to anyone?
