Everyone at work gets their work done so fast and just hops off at five. I have like two free hours in my days, not exaggerating, and I feel guilty for even using them. I literally get up at 6 am and work till 8 pm. Eat dinner watch a video and go back to work till 11:30. It feels like I’m working all day but I get next to nothing done the whole time. I’m exhausted, I’m alone, I’m a loser.  I’m trying so hard, I brush it off like I’m just lazy and don’t care but I care a lot, even though I absolutely hate my job, I work so hard. I don’t think there could possibly be a person in the world who hates themself for than I do.   It’s crazy that in text it seems so bland. I was sobbing while writing this. I hate my life so much. I just needed to vent, I’m so sorry.   This is an edit...I can’t explain how my heart feels right now opening reddit to this...you all have no idea how much you have lifted me, and from an incredibly dark place. Words can’t describe my gratitude. I will answer all of you. Thank you so much. For anyone who relates, I’m so deeply sorry. But reading everyone’s replies gives me hope we can find a way out. Thank you thank you thank you thank you.
