d12961aa0505a4c31a4dff5351e27c509baeab04577063ba1b9bb8befd4aaa44;;;I took adderall (generic) and now have to wonder- is it normal to just do things? Is this what ive been missing?;;;Tldr: took the pill- and i cleaned up with no internal struggle. I simply think of something or see something that should be done because its important... And i start doing it. Is that really the drug, or is it wishful thinking? Is this how nt's live?   I was perscribed a low dose (10mg) adderall (m amphetamine salt) and took it for the first time today. I didnt get any jitters or heart race increases. I didnt feel like i was a superhuman. I felt normal.  And then at one point while i was working on my computer i had a wire get caught on some piece of clutter. I had a moment of thinking "why do you live like this"- basically just a quick joke to myself-but then i started cleaning. Like my brain realized if you dont want to live like this you dont have to. I didnt feel rushed or compelled-i just kind of wanted to have an organized space like i always want but never have- and was able to simply pull myself off of my computer and just start cleaning.  I know it sounds so simple and easy- like something that i shouldnt even be surprised by- but i never do that. I always have those "ill get to it later- after i do this..." Kind of thoughts. And then i never get to it. Today ive just been... Doing things.  And i dont know. Is this the effect of the drug? Is this how people normally are? Ive seen things out of place around the house and ive just been putting them away. I had a dirty dish in my hand and i washed it. And the other dishes in the sink. I guess im just worried i might be giving myself a placebo effect. Or even if im not, is this just a starting "honeymoon phase"?
