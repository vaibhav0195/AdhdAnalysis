It is characterized by pervasive, long-term (typically 3+ months) exhaustion, loss of function, and reduced tolerance to stimulus";;;This study surfaced on /r/science: https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/gyb96a/study_autistic_burnout_is_a_syndrome/  I'm crossposting it here, because the mechanism described  ("resulting from chronic life stress and a mismatch of expectations and abilities without adequate supports. It is characterized by pervasive, long-term (typically 3+ months) exhaustion, loss of function, and reduced tolerance to stimulus") seems very relevant for ADHD-induced burnout/depression as well.  At the same time I'd like to point out this passage from the top comment (from supposedly a psychiatrist): "Burnout doesn’t just happen with autism, although autistic burnout has specific symptoms that differentiate it from other types of burnout, which will tend to have their own other specific symptoms. Burnout can happen with any chronic condition that impacts a person’s function and life satisfaction. In mental health, we see burnout with autism, ADHD, depression, anxiety, OCD, most every chronic condition that we treat. **Again, autistic burnout will be different from ADHD burnout**, but many conditions can cause burnout."  So bear in mind that this study is about autistic burnout, and that it differs in details from ADHD-burnout according to a specialist, even though its *short* description seems very relevant and applicable.
