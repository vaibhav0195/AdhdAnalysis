Switched jobs and my old doctor (who I didn't really like anyway, but at least he never questioned my adderall) doesn't take my new insurance. Got the morning off work, took the train into the city to visit a brand new doctor. She acts nice but confesses that she has a "bias" against stimulants and she's not sure if ADHD is "real". Then she says she'll prescribe it but we need to develop a better long term plan, yada yada, and then she orders a fucking DRUG SCREEN. I have never been asked to take a drug screen when being prescribed adderall (the script is only 10 mg, by the way). I told her I don't appreciate being treated like a criminal when I'm just trying to get the medicine I need to bring me to baseline.  Now I'm very frustrated. She did say she'll prescribe it, but I don't know if I want to work with a doctor who's so dismissive of my very fucking real brain problems that I've struggled with for the past 20-25 years.   And I live in the U.S., so finding a new doctor is expensive and time consuming and it's impossible to ever really know how much it might cost, especially if they insist on ordering labs.
