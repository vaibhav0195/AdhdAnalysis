They are able to execute the instructions I've given them properly and benefit from it, but when it comes to executing plans I've made for myself I just never seem to get it right or rather I shouId say that I never seem to get started.   Edit : Thank you kind strangers for the gold & silver. I've noticed that some people are saying that they are not good planners and that they execute best at the last minute. I find that relatable, even though I think of myself as a good planner. The most productive and noteworthy things I've been able to accomplish were all unplanned and kinda pushed on me. I think all ADHD people live by the motto, "If tomorrow isn't the due date, today isn't the do date".  Reading comments from you all makes me think that I am reading about myself just on different days of the week. I can literally relate to everything you all are saying. This kinda makes me feel that we are all in this together and we will get through it all. I always second doubt my own ideas and generally question my ability to lead a 'normal' life, but listening to you all gives me much hope. You all deserve all the loves and hugs in the world. Thank you for being so supportive !
