d57436a93d15f40285554a812b2ae28dc7ce13b299f271e7d8e7c6c7f7ff1cc6;;;I've just realised I dont remember 99.99% of my life;;;So I know adhd affects short tern memory but has it affected anyones long term?  I have just been thinking about all the people i used to be close friends with, ex partners who i spent years with and previous jobs and universities. And from all those I'm lucky to remember a single thing. I cant remember any conversations I've had. Feeling pretty down about it, i dont know whats caused it or how long I've had this because i think it's only recently that I've really started to think about what i can remember   Just for reference i turned 30 this year.  EDIT - Wow did not expect this level of reply! Thank you to everyone who has commented and left badges! Ive been reading through your comments and it's reassuring to know I'm not the only one, also lots of great suggestions for getting better. I'm so glad i found this sub ❤️
