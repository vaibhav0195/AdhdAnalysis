Earlier this year, I finally convinced them to let me give it a try, and was prescribed Vyvanse. If I hadnâ€™t been, I donâ€™t know if I would have been able to put in the work to get accepted into college. I applied as a music education major, and had to play catch up to get my audition songs ready, with three months to do so (November-February). This required me to practice for about two-three hours a day, sometimes four. It was hard to keep myself on this schedule, but I did it. I got into Mason Gross, one of the best music schools around me. Iâ€™m super proud of myself for being able to commit to this level of work, and I hope I can continue to have this much motivation and success.
