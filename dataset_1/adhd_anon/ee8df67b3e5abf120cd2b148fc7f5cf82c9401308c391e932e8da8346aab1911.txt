ee8df67b3e5abf120cd2b148fc7f5cf82c9401308c391e932e8da8346aab1911;;;I'm allowed to call myself stupid... you aren't;;;I know I'm not dumb, in fact, I must've been pretty damn smart to be able to survive at least 10 years undiagnosed with literally no one catching on.  If I call myself dumb, it isn't a reflection on my self-esteem (at least for me it isn't). 8 times out of 10 it's probably me coping in the moment and the other 2 it's just to get people off my back when I'm being forgetful.   Edit: I am aware and fully agree that using the word "stupid" even in reference to myself is destructive and I am definitely a lot better about it than I was even a year ago.
