HOW DID I MISS THAT.   DUH.  THAT MAKES SO MUCH SENSE.  Here I was, thinking I must have some sort of borderline personality disorder or hormonal imbalance or something else wrong with me because I have these WILD mood fluctuations in response to good or bad things happening.  ITS THE FLIPPING ADHD FOLKS!  OF COURSE. If we can't inhibit impulsive behaviours like talking out of turn and whatnot, how could we expect to inhibit expressing our EMOTIONS?!   When normal people experience something that makes them upset, they can use their prefrontal cortex to calm themselves down, or at least push the feelings away until they are alone and can express them without causing a scene. Whereas we just FEEL ALL THE FEELINGS and either cry or rage out accordingly until something else catches our attention! No wonder I've always been garbage at self soothing!! Because that's an executive inhibition thing!!  DUH!  Ugh, guys. So much makes sense now. How did I not know this? How did I miss this in all my classes, research, and explainations from the doctors when I was diagnosed? Also the ADHD I guess ðŸ˜…
