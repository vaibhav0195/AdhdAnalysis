Someone posted about wanting to tell their boss about their ADHD and I’d commented about how not doing that at my last job was one of my biggest regrets in life. I didn’t tell them I was struggling with working from home, I just quit. I wasn’t officially diagnosed or medicated and with the severity of my ADHD it was almost impossible for me to get anything done and I’d have panic attacks almost every day.   But now, I have my shit together and my meds have basically saved my life- and that post saved my ass. I’m a nanny and I really don’t like it, but seeing that post made me reach out to my old boss and ask for my job back.   I have a “re-interview” Friday and I know I’m getting it back. Fuck yeah. Thank you.  Edit: ty for the award friend :)  Edit edit: Reaching out to your boss/supervisor about your ADHD is never an easy thing. Use common sense here if you plan to. If you don’t know them well but you feel like it’s an important conversation to have, an email with a short explanation and an attachment of a note from your doc/psychiatrist should be fine.  Edit edit edit: Most companies/businesses in most states require accommodation for ADD/ADHD under ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act). You can’t be fired specifically for your disability once you’ve disclosed your official diagnosis with them, however, you can still be fired for still not doing your job after receiving reasonable accommodations once you’ve disclosed this.
