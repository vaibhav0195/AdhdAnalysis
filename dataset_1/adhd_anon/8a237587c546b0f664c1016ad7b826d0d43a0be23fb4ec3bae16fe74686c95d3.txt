8a237587c546b0f664c1016ad7b826d0d43a0be23fb4ec3bae16fe74686c95d3;;;I finished my first semester of college with a 2.3 GPA. My summer semester closed out yesterday, and I found out that I got a 4.0 for the first time in my life.;;;Hey guys!! long time lurker first time poster. i was first diagnosed back in the spring of 2018, after failing most of my classes horribly in the fall. before starting medication i could never focus for more than 5 minutes, my grades were horrible, and i couldn’t hold down a job for more than a month (srs got fired 2 times). i put a lot of weight on my academic performance, and getting Ds and Fs even though i was trying my hardest made me very anxious and depressed. i felt like a failure.  fast forward to now. i’ve started taking medication. i’m working 2 jobs, and taking classes full-time at my university. i decided to take 5 classes in a 6-week period.  it’s been extremely stressful, but today i found out i got a 4.0 GPA!!!! i never in a million years could’ve imagined getting straight As, even when i wasn’t working and school was my only responsibility. if i can do it, you can too!  UPDATE: wow i’m really surprised by the amount of attention this got. thank you for the kind words :)
