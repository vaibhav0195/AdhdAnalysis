Here’s how it works and why it’s so bad.” (From a Tumblr post linked below.);;;Child says, “I can’t do this.” Adult (teacher or parent) does not believe it, because Adult has seen Child do things that Adult considers more difficult, and Child is too young to properly articulate why the task is difficult.  Adult decides that the problem is something other than true inability, like laziness, lack of self-confidence, stubbornness, or lack of motivation.  Adult applies motivation in the form of harsher and harsher scoldings and punishments. Child becomes horribly distressed by these punishments. Finally, the negative emotions produce a wave of adrenaline that temporarily repairs the neurotransmitter deficits caused by ADHD, and Child manages to do the task, nearly dropping from relief when it’s finally done.  The lesson Adult takes away is that Child was able to do it all along, the task was quite reasonable, and Child just wasn’t trying hard enough.   Now, surely Child has mastered the task and learned the value of simply following instructions the first time.  The lessons Child takes away? Well, it varies, but it might be:  -How to do the task while in a state of extreme panic, which does NOT easily translate into doing the task when calm.  -Using emergency fight-or-flight overdrive to deal with normal daily problems is reasonable and even expected.  -It’s not acceptable to refuse tasks, no matter how difficult or potentially harmful.  -Asking for help does not result in getting useful help.  ..............  I just read all this and I’m floored.  From:  https://highlycaffeinatedhorsewriter.tumblr.com/post/182580123449/whats-the-real-lesson  EDIT: I totally didn’t expect this to resonate with so many people! We aren’t alone, y’all. I love this community. This is how we heal.💕  EDIT 2: someone pointed out this clarification, that it’s not a wave of Adrenalin but a wave of serotonin:  “The adrenaline release is a physiological response to stress and is responsible for the heightened emotions and arousal, but serotonin mediates the behavioral response. Once that response is initiated, the heightened adrenaline will cause stronger memory consolidation, causing the child to learn to do that task only when subjected to an intense stress response, as well as causing avoidant behavior toward that task at all. The rest is on point though.”
