The ignorance is real, folks.;;;This is the thread I'm talking about: https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/bkkf9a/my_notes_before_and_after_being_prescribed/  This is just a rant - Sorry, needed to get it off my chest.   I think this is one of the most *frustrating* threads I've ever read. There is so much unbelievable ignorance in the comments it's driving me nuts.   "Meth lite"  "Turns you into an emotionless asshole"  "Big pharma"  Goodness fucking me, if anyone knew the massive quality of life improvement that I went through when i got treated they would shut their fucking mouths.   I've said it before, and I'll say it again - The stigma of having ADD and being treated is the worst fucking thing.
