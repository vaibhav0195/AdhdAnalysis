Apologies in advance. This probs won’t even make sense. When I look back on my whole life and everything I can remember, I just think to my self why didn’t a single care giver or teacher notice any of my symptoms, why was I never given any support and why the heck was I failed so badly. Was left my whole school life undiagnosed. In my opinion it was very obvious, even from such a young age. Why are girls in particular often not noticed. I can only pray that kids in the future do not get failed and actually get support :( I understand the teachers may have just thought I was a badly behaved kid and I didn’t care about school but doesn’t change the fact that I could have had such a different school life.. I’m just mad. I want to dedicate so much of my life to raising awareness for adhd
