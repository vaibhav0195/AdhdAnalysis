bc5f061f9b529584f663740b55cf4abe2c9095827c854624249e1f3a00218414;;;My mom dropped a bomb on me today;;;I was recently diagnosed with ADHD. I wanted to ask my mom how bad my symptoms were when I was a child and if anybody else in my extended family might have this disorder. I didn't even get a chance to get my whole thought out before she blurted, **"Oh, yeah, I know you have ADHD. You were diagnosed when you were 7."** I'm sorry. WHAT?! I've gone my entire life thinking that I'm not as smart as my friends. Thinking that I'm not good enough for the job that I have. Struggling through high school and college. How much easier would the last **23 years** have been if I had been able to take medication?  &#x200B;  My mom never once told me that I was diagnosed. I have never taken medication and I don't remember ever seeing any doctors when I was a child. Her reason for not pursuing any kind of corrective measures? Apparently the doctor that diagnosed me told her that ADHD is a sign of an intelligent brain. So she latched onto that and didn't think there was even a problem to address.  &#x200B;  Not gonna lie, I'm livid right now.
