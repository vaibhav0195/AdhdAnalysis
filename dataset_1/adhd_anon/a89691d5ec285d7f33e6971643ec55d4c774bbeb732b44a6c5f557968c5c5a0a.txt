Edit: I’ve had a few people mention how *everyone* experiences this, not just people with ADHD. I’m absolutely aware of this. The thing is, everybody experiences ADHD symptoms to some degree. The difference is that many neurotypical people experience them every once in a while; not everyday, multiple times a day.   I’ve been keeping up on reading as many comments as I can, and I’ve read a bunch from people saying how validating this thread is, knowing that they’re not the only ones who struggle with things like this. That shit absolutely warms my heart, and I think that’s what this sub should be for. I’m sure plenty of the things us ADHDers struggle with aren’t entirely exclusive to just us, but that’s why it makes it so much goddamn harder. Because as much as people may understand some of the challenges we face, they think we should be able to deal with them just as easily as everyone else.
