ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder so medications are not a crutch;;;ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder meaning a condition that is due to differences in in the development and function of the nervous system.  I think it's worth noting for people who think that medications are a crutch that this is **physical problem with our brains** that presents as a mental heath issue.  Taking meds for this is the same as someone taking meds for a heart condition; it's maintenance for the mind.  I had it in my head for a long time that taking meds is a crutch  and it stopped me from getting the help I needed.  This goes for all medication prescribed by your doctor. Self care is not always about the cure but how we manage our illnesses.  edited: some words for better clarity
