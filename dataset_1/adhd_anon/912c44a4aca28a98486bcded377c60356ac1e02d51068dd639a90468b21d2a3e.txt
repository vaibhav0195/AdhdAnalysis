The account I’m currently on is new cus too many people knew my old username, but I’ve been following this sub for awhile and always felt inspired by people’s posts, so I wanted to share my own accomplishment.   After having applied to 5 grad schools because I didn’t think I’d get in anywhere, I have received an admissions offer from EVERY SCHOOL I APPLIED TO, including the best schools in my field!!! I AM IN SHOCK!!!!!!!!   I always thought I was stupid. Sometimes, I’d have moments where I’d convince myself of my intelligence, but then I’d go to school and see how easily everyone else could learn and immediately get discouraged. I thought my brain didn’t work.   Over the years, I’ve figured out what strategies are the most helpful for learning and test-taking. I’ll make another post in the future about the best strategies that have helped me get through school and university. My biggest tip: don’t do what everyone else is doing and expect it to work for you. Our brains are different but we are SO LUCKY to have ADHD. Hyperfocus and the procrastination adrenaline have turned from inconveniences into traits I utilize for my success.   I wanted to share this with you guys so you know it’s possible to achieve all of your dreams, no matter how hard things get with ADHD. We are all smarter than we give ourselves credit for!  Edit: Thank you so much for all of your support. So emotional :) study tips here https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/b3kwvk/how_to_leverage_your_adhd_to_succeed_in_school_as/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x
