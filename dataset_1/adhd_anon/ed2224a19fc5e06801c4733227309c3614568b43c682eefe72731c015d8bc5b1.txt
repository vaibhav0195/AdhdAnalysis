ed2224a19fc5e06801c4733227309c3614568b43c682eefe72731c015d8bc5b1;;;tried adderall the first time WTF;;;this shit was crazy i could actually understand what people are saying. normally i only catch some of the words while im thinking of other stuff. i could listen to them and wait my turn to talk instead of just saying whatever i think of because i might forget it. and i could understand my lecture and didnt get up during it to walk around. it was making sense and i could connect what hes saying to whats on the white board. i was actually learning it.  i thought it will feel like im on something, it didnt feel stimulating to me, i felt 0 energy or euphoria that people describe, i get more of that from caffeine. how i feel is  i only feel calm and IN CONTROL. I could control what i want to do, if i want to do something i can do it instead of procrastinating it. i can choose what i say and plan out how i want to say it. i can choose what i pay attention to and how i spend my time.
