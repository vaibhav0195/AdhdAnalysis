4994ee6b2b673ab0115b8f9bc9e284cc87816dfe1ae7f60603814f3c089c30c2;;;My parents yelled at my little brother with ADHD cus he wasn't focused on a movie and I stood up for him;;;Personally this irked me to high hell. My mom very nicely asked if we would watch Its A Wonderful Life for christmas eve. My little brothers meds just wore off before the movie started so he was all squirmy and couldnt pay attention. My stepdad yelled at him "COULD YOU STOP" cus he and my other brother joked and were discussing the movie, so I responded "I thought it was funny". I understand its important to be quiet during movies, but its christmas eve, were supposed to have fun as a family. So I texted her and told her that theyre making this movie much less fun, and cus its christmas eve we would like to have fun as a family, meaning we interact and laugh. Were not in a movie theatre. But also I told her to not get mad at him for expecting something he can't do right now, and that theres other ways to approach this.  edit: my mom yelled at him too
