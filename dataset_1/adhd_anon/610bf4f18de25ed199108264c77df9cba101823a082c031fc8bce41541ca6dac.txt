610bf4f18de25ed199108264c77df9cba101823a082c031fc8bce41541ca6dac;;;Failed out of college four years ago. Came back and got 100 on the first exam where the class exam median was 52.;;;Undiagnosed adhd my first go at college and while also dealing with severe depression.   Got diagnosed, worked on my mental health, and decided to give college a go again.   Came back this semester working my butt off, going through the long process of getting accommodations, and studying everyday.   Professor tells class that we did the worst in his several years of teaching. I’m nervous and in a bad mood waiting for the grade to be posted.   See 100 on blackboard. Must be a mistake. Go talk to professor. NOPE.   Anyone struggling with school, life, and work. YOU GOT THIS. DONT GIVE UP.   Edit: You guys are amazing. I posted this because I wanted to tell any single person about how my hard work has finally started to produce results. I did not expect such a positive response. The happiness I have felt from your encouraging words, advice, questions, and almost family-like interaction you guys have provided is unmeasurable.   For those of you who are succeeding, keep at it!! Don’t slow down.   For those of you who are struggling, we all have our ups and downs. It’s what you do with it that matters. Fight and never give up! Keep your chin up, we are all rooting for you :)  Edit 2: The amount of love I have for you guys...  Those who have fought and are succeeding have shared stories that I aspire to one day make my own. You provide the crucial evidence that I desperately need to know that this progress can continue and maybe even improve.   Those who are beginning the fight/in the midst of it... you are an inspiration. You are the hope that so many individuals need. You are what keeps me going. My love for you and your ambitions to take on this difficult journey with a determination so fierce brings me to tears.
