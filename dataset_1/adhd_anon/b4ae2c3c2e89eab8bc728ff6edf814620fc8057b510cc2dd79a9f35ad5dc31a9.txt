b4ae2c3c2e89eab8bc728ff6edf814620fc8057b510cc2dd79a9f35ad5dc31a9;;;Well 10+ years of ADHD and depression and I'm finally buying my own place;;;This is a really emotional and embarrassing post. I have struggled with trying to oht down roots due to depression anxiety and obviously ADHD. Everywhere I have ever been on vacation I seriously would be so happy there and consider living there. When i come back to my shit life and reality my depression would start and i would feel and find reasons to procrastinate due to depression. Time rolls this has gone on fore 10 years or more. Well fuck you life and I am moving to Scotland at easter or when this pandemic is over. It may not seem like a big deal but I have my mortgage in place.
