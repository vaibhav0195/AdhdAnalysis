904edf56fb8a9058cf4f088ed4e9c9aa1d732924260cdca2018e939e67990c6c;;;I finished my Master's degree!;;;I just want to tell everyone that I did it. I finished defending my Master's thesis. I have completed all the requirements for my Master's degree. I was diagnosed with ADHD as an adult and started my college adventure without medication. I maintained a 4.0 throughout my undergrad even without meds for the first half. However, once I started taking meds, it made everything so ... right. I guess that's the best way to describe it. I didn't have to spend as much time reading and re-reading my textbooks and I didn't go all over the place with my papers just to have to go back and correct them multiple times. After my undergrad degrees (I completed an associate's and three Bachelor's degrees) I went for my Master's and now I'm done. I'm so happy for myself.  I guess since I can't celebrate in the real world I came here to celebrate.  Edit: Some have expressed doubt that I have three Bachelor's degrees, so here is a picture. https://imgur.com/WSR3ZxB
