2c8bf1aaf29319f5fe00a8f0f915d25bc2f6ca1899c2c66acf31456a967a1258;;;The hardest thing about ADHD is no-one understands it, you can't explain it, everyone thinks they've got it and everyone thinks there's nothing wrong with you. But your life is falling apart and your told nothings wrong with you.;;;I wish I had dyslexia, autism or schizophrenia. At least then people would get it.  No-one says to dyslexics "I find it hard to read text sometimes too - try reading slowly, there's nothing wrong with you",  ... to our autistic crew - "just think about what the implication of a statement is, just don't get overwhelmed, change is good"   ... to paranoid schizophrenic gang - "I feel like the radio is talking directly to me too sometimes. And I saw a Facebook ad about shoes after looking at shoes online, maybe they're following all of us!"   Even writing this crushes me. I know there are some that'll read this and think - just try harder. Good god, I'm trying. I get the feeling _you_ get when you're hyping yourself up to jump off a 10m diving board *when I open my emails*.   PS I've recently become medicated. Holy shit. Scary as fuck to admit there's something wrong but what a difference. I can have a plan and do the plan.   I wish I could explain the difference to people that don't already know what I mean.  . .  EDIT: This community is amazing - so encouraging and supportive!  You all really helped me (and people reading this thread) to not feel like so isolated.  As an adult with newly diagnosed ADHD it's tough.  It feels like there's been a monumental shift in who I am and how I view myself and my perceived failures, yet everyone around me see's the same old (lovable but somewhat useless) person I've always been!
