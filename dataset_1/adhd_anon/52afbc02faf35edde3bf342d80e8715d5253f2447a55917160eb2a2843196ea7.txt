In February I was finally diagnosed and just now received my last remaining final grade for the semester. Thanks to treatment I’ve finished this semester with a 4.0! 🎉;;;Receiving this diagnosis has opened up so many doors for me that I myself had shut and locked because I never believed I was capable of doing it. Treatment has completely transformed my ability to perform academically and I’m eternally grateful for that.   My goal is to continue earning a 4.0 so I might have a chance of getting into grad school in a couple years!🙏🏻
