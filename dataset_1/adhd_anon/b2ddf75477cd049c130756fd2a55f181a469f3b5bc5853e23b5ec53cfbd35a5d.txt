I was diagnosed with ADHD-C in October of last year and am on Strattera (90mg - most of the proper stimulants gave me horrible anxiety and I went 3 days without sleep on Adderall at one point).   On Monday of this week I accepted an offer for a six-figure position for my dream job in IT AT 23!  TL;DR Backstory: Got entry level government job out of high school, worked my way up, just landed new 6 figure position at 23!   Full Backstory:  While I was unmedicated and had just finished high school I landed a really super entry level casual job in a State Government agency in my hometown. Five years of working my way up and really super duper hyper focusing on my career (kinda was scared of being considered a “loser” because I barely made it through high school) I just was offered and I accepted a 6 figure IT role at 23!  Just wanted to take a second to thank each and every one of you guys for the kind words of encouragement and support we all share with each other in this subreddit! It’s truly a beautiful corner of the Internet to be a part of 🥺!   You’re all such great people! I think with a bit of hard work, determination and dedication we can all be where we want to be in our careers and in our lives. Our condition(s) might make that journey a bit more rocky on the way but we just gotta keep on, keeping on 😊!  **Fact of the day: You can do it buddy!**  Keep striving guys, you got this 👏🏽🙌🏽 !!!!
