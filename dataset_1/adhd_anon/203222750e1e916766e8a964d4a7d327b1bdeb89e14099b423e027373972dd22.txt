So I thought we could stop scrolling together!   There’s probably something you need to do: sleep, send that email, finish that assignment, make that appointment, call someone, put the wet clothes in the dryer before you go to sleep, set up for tomorrow, organize for work/school, and many other tasks I feel like we easily forget about or get distracted from.   Okay so 3, 2, 1, and go do the thing! :D I’m going to sleep.  Edit: Holy shit lol I legit posted on mobile, locked my phone, and popped my socket back in, and went to bed and I wake up to 700+ upvotes and 50+ comments? (‘: And here I was about to say fuck it and not go to the first day of school but you know what? I will attend Ecology that starts in 4 minutes! BATTLE STATIONS!!!   Oh and thank you guys so much for the awards. I didn’t expect this to blow up like it did.
