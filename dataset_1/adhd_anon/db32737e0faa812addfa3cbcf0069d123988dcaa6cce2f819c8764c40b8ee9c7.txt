db32737e0faa812addfa3cbcf0069d123988dcaa6cce2f819c8764c40b8ee9c7;;;A word on meds from an ADHD doc;;;I'm a physician with ADHD and I treat ADHD in children.  My own diagnosis at age 8 and my subsequent discovery of my own ability to succeed at school led to me choosing to follow this career path and give back to the medical community that helped me so much.    I often see posts in this subreddit in which people ask how a medicine is "supposed" to make them feel or solicit experiences from other posters.  While I think it's fine for people to discuss their own experiences, I want to emphasize: *you cannot generalize one person's experience with an ADHD med to all people*.    I can have two patients the same age, ethnicity, size, sex, and one does great on CONCERTA and the other does horribly.  That goes for just about every med.  Personally, I take CONCERTA and it works great for me, while I found ADDERALL and DEXEDRINE to be suboptimal with watered-down effects.  But I have plenty of patients who would very adamantly tell the opposite story.    What matters is that your doctor takes a uniform approach to stimulant medication for all patients and that your doctor initially follows up with you frequently, takes your concerns and opinions about your response and side-effects seriously, and understands the mechanisms of action and pharmacokinetics at work.  That last bit is important.  When I manage an ADHD med, I have plasma concentration graphs in my head while I visualize mathematically what I want for a patient.  It really does take that kind of understanding, in my opinion, to provide the best management for patients.  So when someone else tells you that this or that medication was wonderful or terrible, take that story with a huge grain of salt.  Your own response might be very different and the only way to know is to try.
