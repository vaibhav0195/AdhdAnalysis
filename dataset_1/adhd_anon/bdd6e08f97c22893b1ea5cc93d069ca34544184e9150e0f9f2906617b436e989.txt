bdd6e08f97c22893b1ea5cc93d069ca34544184e9150e0f9f2906617b436e989;;;I’m thinking my relationships follow along the same lines as my hobbies: Jack of all trades, master of none; friend of all, best of none;;;I’ve seen so many posts about people being interested in a million different things/hobbies/careers that they’re never able to really be good at one or even start most of them (and I totally relate to all that)  But I’ve been wondering if that feeling applies to the people in my life as well  There are so many friends from the different places I’ve lived that i want to keep being friends with and that I miss dearly! There are so many friends and family members that I want to keep up with and know what’s going on in their lives. And yet, I’m really close with almost no one.  I’ve never been anyone’s best friend except my (now ex) long term boyfriend, who I think I sort of hyperfocused on for the middle part of our relationship  But I so desperately want a best friend. I want someone to tell me about themselves and the struggles they’re going through and I want someone I don’t feel bad about telling my struggles to  And yet I also want to stay friends with so many people and completely struggle to keep up with those friendships  And yeah I’ve seen the comments where people kindly finish the phrase to say “jack of all trades, master of none is better than a master of one” (or however it’s exactly worded) but I’m not so sure that I can apply that to relationships. It seems rather important to have a few very close relationships
