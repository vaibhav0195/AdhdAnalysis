c6096d25bb99fb12598a0fb7725ff3d6dbd56e863a9dfa7d57cd197c43de4927;;;Didn't realize my boss was helping me until today;;;Awhile ago my boss put two and two together and figured out I have ADHD. The first time I told her she implied that she knew, I guess I'm that obvious. Anyway, she's been helping me with time management and always emails me follow ups. She let me borrow a book about prioritizing tasks and has given tips on how she organizes. She has an open door if I'm not sure what the best thing to work at the time would be. She's always been big on emailing things but she always sends me reminders on things. For example, this week I have to take my lunch outside of my routine and she set up a reminder on my calendar for me. When we did the office remodel she deliberately put my new cube alllllll the way in the back, away from people, in a very quiet corner of the office.  So, I've been having issues with a co-worker and began feeling spiteful. Me, being the asshole I am, started looking up accomodations for my ADHD and epilepsy. After doing research, they've been doing this for me all along and it actually makes me really happy. I just wanted to share how happy it made me and how much better I feel about my job. They set me up for success without me realizing it. :) I've been keeping her in the loop on my treatment because they've been changing my meds so I've been moody with coworkers so it's been noticed. I'm just really happy right now.
