(especially for us);;;So the funny thing with neurotypicals is that most of the time they *want to* do something, they automatically have an amount of *motivation* to do that. So they assume that when they don't feel motivated to do something, it means they dont want it, because for most cases, the two overlap. But with our ADHD brains it is a different story. **The overlap between the things we want to do and the things we have motivation to do ist way smaller.** So often times we get told by neurotypicals that we actually don't want something, because they see our lack of motivation and our struggle to do it. We get told that we are just lazy, but in reality we *reaaallly want it*, we just have 10 times less motivation. But when everybody tells us lack of motivation means not wanting something, because for them it applies, we **start to believe that and think that something is wrong with us**. Then we try even harder, up to the point where we are just exhausted and hating ourselves to death.   So we need to understand, that our brains *really* function differently than nerotypical brains. And by realizing the difference between wanting and feeling motivated everyday, we maybe hold on to things we know we want, where neurotypicals will have given up thinking they must not want it.   *So don't let yourself down by others saying this and that, you know what you really want, probably more than they know!*
