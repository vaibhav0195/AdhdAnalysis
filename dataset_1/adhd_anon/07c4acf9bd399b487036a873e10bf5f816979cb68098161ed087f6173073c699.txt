07c4acf9bd399b487036a873e10bf5f816979cb68098161ed087f6173073c699;;;Iâ€™ve graduated!;;;I started college in Fall of 2013, and through many many hardships and almost dropping out entirely, I got diagnosed with ADHD and was put on meds only this semester. I just got my final grades back and after nearly 7 years of blood, sweat, and tears, I have finally graduated with my bachelorâ€™s degree from Texas A&M University!!   EDIT: Omg you guys!! I was NOT expecting this kind of support! Iâ€™m so overwhelmed, thanks so much. ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I will try my very best to respond to each of you individually, but just know I have read every single one of your comments and you are all so amazing. Thank you! ðŸ¥°
