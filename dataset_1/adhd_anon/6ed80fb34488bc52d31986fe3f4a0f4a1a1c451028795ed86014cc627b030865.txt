I don't remember the exact year that my wife and I had him diagnosed, but I always knew he had it.  My wife didn't always know, but that's a long story for another post.  Many of you are probably wondering what the point of this post is.  Maybe I am too.  But I have been lurking here occasionally, and some of the stories I read break my heart.  So here's my message to this community...   It's okay.    It's okay that I asked you to take out the trash and you forgot.  It's just trash.  It's okay that sometimes you're late for school, and sometimes you forget to bring your homework home.  What I care about are the other times.  The times you come home happy that you made a new friend, or that you got an A.  Or a B.  Or a C.  It's just school.  It's okay that you are sometimes irritable.  Irritating.  Infuriating.  You're also kind.  Humble.  Caring.  Amazing.  Beautiful.  And that's more than just okay.  It's okay that sometimes you're a little hard to follow.   That sometimes you talk about three different things at once.  I wish I knew as much as you, that I had the passion that you have about the things that excite you.    It's okay if you choose to take medication to make your life easier.  Don't like meds?  That's okay too.  The point is this.  You are all wonderful, beautiful, amazing people.  You come from all walks of life.   You've all taken a different path.  Just know that there are people who care about you.  There are people who get you.  There are people who love you, and want you to be happy.  It will be okay.  Edit:  Thank you all for the comments and messages.  Also thanks for the gold/silver/platinum kind strangers.    Most importantly, thank you for reading this and for your responses.  This is an awesome community, thanks for making me feel so welcome.
