Thank you to each and every one of you.;;;I finally received an official diagnosis at close to 40. I almost wanted to cry out of relief that it is now official and not just in my head. The impostor syndrome is strong with this one.  Thank you to every one of you who shared your experiences and gave encouragement, advice, and overall support in this sub-reddit. There were symptoms I wasn't even aware could fall under ADHD.  Because of all of you, I was able to consult my psychiatrist with informed questions and descriptions.  You guys have helped navigate this journey more than you can imagine.  The flair fits what today is for me: a celebration of finally getting the correct diagnosis and tools to manage it.  Thank you.  To the redditor who introduced me to this subreddit, encouraged me to get a diagnosis and graciously allowed me to PM her questions, I only wish I could thank you directly, but unfortunately Reddit ate my whole inbox and I lost your username.  From the bottom of my heart, thank you.
