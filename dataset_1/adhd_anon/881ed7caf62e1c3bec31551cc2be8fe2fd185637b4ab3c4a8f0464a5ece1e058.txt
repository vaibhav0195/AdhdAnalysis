ADHD has the potential to make you feel like a shell of your former self if left undiagnosed too long. I know a lot of you have talked about how you used to love to read and now it’s so hard to even pick up a book.   That’s why I wish it was more widely discussed so that people could understand more about what this really is. Nobody deserves this, but to those who live with this everyday, I love and appreciate you all. You’re the real MVPs.
