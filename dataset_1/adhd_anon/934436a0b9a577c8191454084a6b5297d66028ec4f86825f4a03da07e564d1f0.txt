Today i put them on for my last one and was soon told to take them off. For NO reason!!! I tried to make clear there wasnt any issue with it before.  He told me 'Look! Isnt it sooo silent here! Take them off!' I whispered 'Thats not the point!' and took them off.  I could hold down my anger towards his sarcastic remark. Like, dude, i clearly dont wear such a device if i didnt need it. Its not for fun.  I cried for about 10 seconds and then tried sucking it in. Having lost 15 minutes on an already short timespan my brain just started making chaos. I ended up doing the completely wrong assignment for 30 MINUTES!!! I had to pull the rest of it together in 25 minutes because of him being super inconsiderate.  Yea i mean, dont mean to be dramatic, it could be worse. Its just that people dont realise how important it is.  Ironically, the exam was about 12 books we had to read, and because i cant read books without pulling my hair out out of frustration, i hadnt read a single one of them. I studied the summaries and hopefully got out of it fine.  TL;DR Teacher told me to take of my silence headphones for no reason which made me mess up my exam.  Edit: not virtual! real life exam. with some useless germ spray.
