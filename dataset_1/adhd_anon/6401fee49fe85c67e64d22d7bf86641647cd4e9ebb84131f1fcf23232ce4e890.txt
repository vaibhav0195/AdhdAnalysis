6401fee49fe85c67e64d22d7bf86641647cd4e9ebb84131f1fcf23232ce4e890;;;i have two brain cells and they both have anxiety;;;i was in the shower basically freaking out thinking about all the things i had to do today and how i had no idea how i was going to get everything done.  i got out and wrote everything down immediately. hereâ€™s the list:  - do laundry - clean bathroom - study  after writing everything down, i look at it and realize how insane i truly am. 3 whole things???? are u kidding???? im freaking out wondering how im going to finish THREE TASKS??? now watch me sit here forever because i feel like im forgetting something and not start anything until the last minute because of it. im tired of myself honestly.  edit: update - i didnt think this would get that much attention... thank u to all who came w advice. i did have things broken down into sub tasks but bc the general tasks wouldnt take that long (besides probably the laundry), i left the subtasks out since i didnt think all of adhd reddit would make it through my personal to do list lol.... anyways the update is that i took a nap instead and still havent started any of these lol... it will be okay though.
