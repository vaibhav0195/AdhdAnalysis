And daggone! you guys are fast!  TL:dr Thank you. (please don't ban me üòâ)  Edit: I'm just getting back to this post because I was working on my Win It Wednesday üòÅ and Ho-lee Cow! I didn't add much detail last night because I thought it really wasnt going to be allowed but I'll tell you guys what prompted this post. At 2 am EST someone posted a "mean" post, though that's a bit of an understatement. That post was only active for 15 or 20 mins before it was locked & removed. That means hundreds, if not thousands, of people did not wake up this morning to a long, heated, hateful argument that made them question the progress they had made in their lives. While we were sleeping someone was watching over our safe place so that when we woke up, it was still safe.  Second! Definitely high 5's all around to everyone who posts, everyone who is honest about their struggles and their victories, everyone who contributes to the discussion and offers kind supportive words, everyone who makes me laugh because I identify with the silly stuff so much! Thank you! You're a great community.
