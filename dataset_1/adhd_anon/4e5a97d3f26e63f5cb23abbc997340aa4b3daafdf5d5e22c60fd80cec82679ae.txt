You literally suck.;;;Hey you. You suck.   You’ve let me go because “it’s been twice where I haven’t shown up to work and you had to call around looking for me”.   I got nurses/paramedics to call you an hour PLUS before my shift started. Both times. You didn’t pick up until an hour after my shift would’ve started. BOTH TIMES.   But you know this.  Both of these times, as explained in both discharge letters, were UNEXPECTED. I could not have foreseen almost having a heart attack the day before it happened, these meds are designed to help me.   Again, you literally know this.   You know my dad hits me, you know I now don’t have a home because I couldn’t live around him anymore. You know I had to fight to get a government payment.   You know that payment depends on how many hours I work. I need a certain amount of hours a week to get the payment and you know that.   You let me cry on your shoulder the day after I left my dad. You said you’d support me. You fired me over text and won’t pick up my calls. You didn’t tell any of my coworkers or the kids that I take care of. You didn’t even let me say goodbye to the fucking kids.    All in all, you suck.    Un-kind regards,  “Literally one of the best employees you’ve ever had”  EDIT: Hey guys...! Made me cry a lil seeing your support! Couple things to clear up;  - I am, in fact, in Australia  - I am 19 and have zero dollahs for a lawyer/legal options  - i have lots of support from my partner and their family, I’m quite lucky despite everything!   So thanks for your comments, messages and advice, I didn’t expect my late night rant to get any attention... you guys made me a little bit more hopeful.
