My boyfriend (27M) of two years with ADD recently broke up with me (29F), about a month after receiving his diagnosis.  He wants time to find himself. I've read so many posts here about how lost people tend to feel post-diagnosis because you literally need to see your entire life with a new lens. I understand and respect this, and I hope everyday that he is doing well.  In his initial consultation, he reported being happy with the relationship. I'm sure it didn't help that I was overseas for one of the busiest periods of my working life when he was going through his testing. I was absent, inattentive, unable to listen to (or observe) his needs (if that makes sense). I also struggled with my own anxiety and depression which made me even more blind to his struggles. To top it all off, I'm in the process of confirming my own ADD diagnosis.  Of course, it's not just about this. Our issues stacked in years of being together. But I'm beginning to realise how I could have understood some of his past behaviours and some of our past experiences in a different light had I known about his diagnosis earlier. If I sought help earlier, I also could have manifested my love in healthier ways and attended to the needs he struggled to communicate.  Well, I can't go back and I’ve come to accept that. So I guess I'm really just here to share all I've learned, in hopes that if any of you are partners, friends or loved ones to people with ADD, you don't make the same mistakes I did.  There are many behaviours that can sometimes make us think people are purposefully hurtful when they are actually just manifestations of an unexplained emotional struggle that is difficult to articulate. Understand, empathise, be patient, and kind. We are all trying our best.  To caveat, I know that everyone is different so just think of all this advice as tools in your Arsenal. Here are some of mine which hopefully can help some of you:  **1. Indulge them and their current fixations.**  There will be stretches of time, long or short, where they will fixate on an idea, an activity, a show, a game, a book, or a general interest that involves several of the above. They will make impulsive purchases to feed this fixation. They will make tradeoffs that might not make sense to you. Do your best to support them. Equip them with materials, books, articles, videos -- but do not get hurt if they don't go through it! Let them run their own race: cheer from the sidelines if they want to be alone and learn with them if they want company.  Let them inspire you and appreciate how lucky you are to be with someone who could be so passionate.  **2. Know that sometimes, fixations end**  If that passion fades, don’t make them feel bad. Instead, congratulate them for what they have achieved and let them move on to the next whenever they’re ready. You never know if or when they'll pick it up again. Watch the light in their eyes flicker on and off, at unpredictable durations, and appreciate it for what it is. They are explorers, adventurers, learners.  **3. Let them engage you first**  Context switching can be really challenging with ADD. So when they want to focus on work or a hobby, just give them space. If your question about dinner or a funny cat video on Facebook can wait until they are disengaged from their current activity, just hold that thought. Make your own list of “things to share with them later”. Let them focus because that focus is fragile.  Unless they invite you to, don’t interrupt or try to join. No matter how well-intentioned, sometimes, the fun of it is in figuring things out by him/herself. Even more times, the fun is in not having to compete or be observed by anyone because the pressure they apply to themselves is high enough.  **4. Be properly engaged**  When they do engage you, pour your heart and soul into it - almost like they do. Be curious and inquire. Understand what about their work or their hobby makes them happy. It might help them find the words too. You never know what other similar activities you might come up with, and things can naturally flow to that next.  **5. Give them space**  This was my biggest mistake. Whenever he felt emotionally stuck, I tried forcing it out of him, thinking that if he just vents or lets it pour out, we can talk it through. It may work for some, but it usually doesn't work for someone with ADD.  ADD is an executive function disorder. It presents issues in emotional regulation. If you force them to talk about feelings that even they don't fully understand yet, they will take the bait and it will lead you both down a terrible path.  It takes time for them to confront and understand what they are really feeling. They may even have the added frustration of not having the correct words for what they're feeling.  Just give them space, leave them be. Respect that.  **6. Be a little deaf and blind during fights**  If the worst comes and they say something they don't mean, don't take it to heart. If they're in the mood to vent, just listen. They might say things that will hurt you. They might lash out and purposefully say mean things. They may blame you for completely tangential things. Detach a little, and hear the emotion (frustration, anger, disappointment) more than the actual slew of words being hurled at you.  Let them speak, vent, rant. When the fog clears, they will be the first person to explain to you what really happened. And you can gently sift through and tackle what was the issue and what was just said out of anger. Their world is still better with you in it. It's just hard to let the rationality rule in emotional distress.  Basically, make room for their anger. The world doesn’t give them enough space for that.  **7. Help design a life / routine that helps them**  ADD impacts executive functions which is essentially the ability to plan, focus, activate, integrate, prioritize, and modulate effort. Designing a slide to be perfectly aligned is the same as filling it up with content - no matter how close the deadline.  So, if they need things to be organised in order to be at peace, respect those boundaries. If they are disorganised and need help designing a routine in order to fulfil their responsibilities, run through the potential structure with them first. Do this patiently and without judgment.  Some practical suggestions:  * Use sticky notes so they don't forget what they needed to do once they switch rooms. * Have a blackboard by the door to remind them of things before they leave the house. * Use a shared calendar so they don't forget important appointments. * Ask them if they'd like you to drop them a text to check on their progress (sometimes this stresses them out instead).  And if they do forget things? Let them know it’s okay. Because hey, we do it with or without ADD too.  **8. Remind them just how amazing they are - just as they are.**  I took this off a comment on one of the reddit threads from u/umklopp because I really can't say it any better:  "Imagine always doing your best, only to constantly hear that not only is your best not good enough, you aren't even really trying. Now further imagine hearing that from basically the very beginning of your life, starting at such an early age that you don't know how to tell the difference between what it feels like to try hard and what it feels like to half-ass something. Basically being scolded for failing to do the impossible your entire life and everyone around your tiny child self informing you that you are choosing to be like this. That's why he can't shake the feeling that there's something wrong with his soul."  They are not weak or insufficient. They are strong, enough, and amazing. It never hurts to hear and feel this.  **9. Encourage them to get professional help**  Finally, there will be parts of this that you cannot solve. You are one of the many support systems he/she has. Encourage them to go to therapy and seek professional help.  If they do get prescribed medication, it will not be perfect from the start so be prepared to go through the various stages of finding the correct treatment too. It will be draining, expensive, and tiring. Be there for them. Just be there.  I hope tonight, you can go back home and give your loved ones a tight hug. Thank you, Reddit.
