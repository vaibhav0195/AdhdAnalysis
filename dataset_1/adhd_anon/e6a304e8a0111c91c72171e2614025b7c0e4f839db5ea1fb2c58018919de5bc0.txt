It helped understand myself more, validated myself, and talks about easy strategies to get things done. From a professor at Berkeley.;;;An awesome video to help understand we dont have an attention disorder, we have an executive  functioning disorder. I see so many posts \\about people struggling to receive their medication, and the end of the video he goes into how its the most treatable disorder with medication. Show that to your biased doctors. I know I have had far too many and wasted so much time and energy because of their preconceived notions and stereotypes.  &#x200B;   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_tpB-B8BXk0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tpB-B8BXk0)  Edit: went off this account for a while, never thought I'd get so many likes and comments, and of course reddit gold!
