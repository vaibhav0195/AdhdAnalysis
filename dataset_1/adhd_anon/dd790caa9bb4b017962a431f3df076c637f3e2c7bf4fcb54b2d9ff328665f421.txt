dd790caa9bb4b017962a431f3df076c637f3e2c7bf4fcb54b2d9ff328665f421;;;I’m so over going to bed motivated, pumped, about all the things i’m going to do the next day. Listing them off how and when i’m going to do them, almost excited about how productive i’m going to be. But, wake up the next day with no motivation again?;;;Just caught my self doing it again, I got a slew of things I need to do tomorrow. I was thinking about how and when I’m going to do these things, it was going to be good, productive and fun. I then just realized I did the same thing the night before with basically the same tasks. Far from the first and light years from the last, just wondering if anyone has this burst of motivation I guess, just before bed? But, then having it die out when you wake up and have to do the usual slog and compromise of what needs to be done?  Edit: so just woke up and I’m not that surprised a number of other people do the same thing, seems like a classic adhd thing. Thanks everyone for offering tips and tricks, hopefully me and others can find some ways to improve our days and lives. I’m going to try shifting exercise to the mornings, I always feel good after exercise, even if it’s just a walk or some yoga.  Today though, and I hope everyone is okay with this, I’m going to take a rare opportunity of creating accountability. I’m my birthday party tonight and I’m going to list all the things I need to do here and cross them out as I do them. Other people can follow along too, maybe make it a bit competitive. If I fail, idk, be disappointed in me, no one enjoys that.  By the time this post is 18 hours old I need to have:  1. ~~Got fertilizer~~ 2. ~~Got sun shield~~ 3. ~~Cake tools~~ 4. ~~Sponge cake ingredients~~ 5. ~~Beer from plonk~~ 6. ~~Though up easy baked snack and get ingredients~~ 7. ~~Clean outdoor table~~ 8. ~~Wash outdoor chair covers~~ 9. ~~Clean kitchen~~ 10. ~~Vacuum~~ 11. ~~Remove boxes~~ 12. ~~Buy bin~~ 13. ~~Enjoy the company of friends and family~~  Sorry if this is weird, but ya gotta take what you get sometimes. If you can, join along and post your list, we will be productive together.  Edit2: Thanks everyone for the well wishes and support, it does truly help that when ever I sit down I see messages of support and im like "aight, ill do one more thing then, just for you". I just wish everyone could always have someone cheering them on.  Edit3: Appologies for the late edit, I'm quite hammered by this point, I had a few people showing up early so I didnt get to update til now. I got achieved all of what I wanted to to at varyinging degrees degrees of success but, I cant thank you all enought for atleast helping me attempt everything on this list. Without you all I dont know that i could have those afternoon tasks  and for that I am so thankful. I may not haven done everything on that list to the best of my ability, but I gave everything a shot plus more, so thats fucking cool. We should do this more. I can barely type, but I wanna help yall, thanks you wonderful people, lets fo, xxxxxxxx.
