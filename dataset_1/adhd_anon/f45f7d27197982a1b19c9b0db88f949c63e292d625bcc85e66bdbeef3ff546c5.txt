It gave me so much of what I needed to build the strength to let my current doctor go. I have a telehealth visit with her on Tuesday and planned on telling her that I will be finding a new doctor. For some reason, I'm extraordinarily nervous, but know I need to do this AND tell her why.   Incidentally, I took my 4yr old to the pediatrician today for her flu shot and found out by accident that our beloved doctor is family practice and I can see him too! I even specifically asked him if he's comfortable treating with patients with ADHD and he said yes! He even talked with me about how misdiagnosed people with ADHD are with depression and he said "I've had so many patients come in thinking they're depressed when in reality they have ADHD and they're just depressed because they can't get s*** done." Like he ACTUALLY gets it.  And he has known  me for YEARS as person not just as a patient. And my oldest is medically complicated so he knows us WELL. I'm so excited to have someone I really know and really really trust as MY doctor. I have a feeling I'm never going to be accused of drug seeking again!!  I want to cry!   Thank you everyone. I needed the groups validation to push through and make this change. My life is going to be so much better. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
