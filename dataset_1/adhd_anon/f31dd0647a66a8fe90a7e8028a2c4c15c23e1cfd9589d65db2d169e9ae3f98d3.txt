I’m so excited, I’ve been organizing my funds and putting things into lists based on priority and even decided to CLEAN UNDER MY BED for the first time in nearly 5 years!!! I cannot wait to get everything done!!  I’ve been thinking about doing this for a while, because I turn 18 this year and I’d like legal adulthood to meet me in a more grown-up room rather than the pink and purple box my childhood self made her own. Not to mention, if i don’t go back to college this year I want somewhere to call my own and just *chill*.  I’m so excited I’ve been talking about it to anyone who’ll listen!!!!
