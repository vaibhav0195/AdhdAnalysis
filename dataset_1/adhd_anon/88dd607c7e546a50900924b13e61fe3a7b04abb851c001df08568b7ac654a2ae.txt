Instead, I feel uncomfortable because I’m sleeping somewhere outside of the house in an unfamiliar environment, constantly tired, and quietly getting annoyed by everything my family says or does.          The worst part is, I know this is wrong. My parents are just having fun and I’m getting annoyed at them for no reason, and I’m in a really nice hotel, so I should feel grateful. I can’t say anything to my family because i don’t want to sound spoiled or anything. I just with having ADHD would prevent me from fully living in the moment.           Also I’m not saying that all vacations are stress-free or that NT people never get irritable. But for me, this happens often with multiple trips, so clearly ADHD is creating larger issues for me.            Edit: Thanks for all the upvotes and rewards! I had no idea this was such a widespread thing that specifically happens to us during vacations. To me, I just thought this was just me continuing to feel irritable during vacations, but you all opened up my eyes and made me realize it might actually be the vacation itself that is causing it! Thanks guys!
