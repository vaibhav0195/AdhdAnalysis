ff0ba4152c21e9e55c9fd23b61510a2c4bd84b552d957bbdc3adcf351974109c;;;Do you ever have moments when you exemplify your adhd so well you leave your friends thinking “wow, this bitch rly do got adhd”;;;Yesterday I gave a perfect representation for how my adhd functions.   My friends asked how long my boyfriend and I have been dating. then i go-  me:  “uhhhhhh hold on gotta think... we started dating in february... omg math is hard... so february..... january... december... what month are we in?”  friends: “november, why are you counting the months backwards”   me: “is it the end of november?”   friends: “yes lmao”   me: “ok ok so february, january, december. that’s three months so 12 minus 3 is 9. 9 we’ve been dating for 9 months”   then my friends looked at me all confused and re did the math for me, assuming i did it wrong. starting from february and counting to the november. which gave them the same number, 9.   and then i started dancing.  The End!   I hope this made sense.... people need to realize I think differently than them but it doesn’t mean i’m wrong lol
