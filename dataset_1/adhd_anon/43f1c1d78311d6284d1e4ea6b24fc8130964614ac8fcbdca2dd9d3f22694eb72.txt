I had done a ton of research into it myself and I was always quick to correct people who would assume that I just can’t pay attention to things, including him. He caught on pretty quickly and started looking into ADHD on his own time.   One night when he came over he was giddy to show me something, and asked me for a piece of paper and a pen. He drew a lightbulb and a flashlight and explained: « Regular brains are like flashlights. They can easily put all their attention into just one thing. YOUR brain is more like a lightbulb: It’s just as bright, but your attention goes in many different directions at once. »   It’s not a perfect analogy but I was so touched that he’d obviously taken the time to look into ADHD and come up with an analogy for me. I was in tears and I still have that sheet of paper to this day.    Edit: Wow my first silver!! Thank you!!
