You're screaming and shouting at yourself, or hyping yourself up to do thing you want to do, but it never happens, so it makes you feel like a failure and a lazy bones, and it just makes it worse, cycling between the feeling of hopelessness and failure to, "Come on, damnit!! Let me just do this *ONE* THING, Please!!"  Idk how long I've been in this cycle, but it sucks. I still haven't started on anything I wanted to do yet.  EDIT: This is really heartwarming to see that we can all support each other at our lowest. Thanks everybody!
