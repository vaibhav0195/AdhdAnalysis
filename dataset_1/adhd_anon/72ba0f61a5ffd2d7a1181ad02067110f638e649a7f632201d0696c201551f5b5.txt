72ba0f61a5ffd2d7a1181ad02067110f638e649a7f632201d0696c201551f5b5;;;I applied to an education in Psychology, 4757 applicants and only 60 spots. I got in! (Sweden);;;I finally have something to feel really proud of. Hell even my parents are proud of me and that just doesn't happen. I don't think I've ever heard my mom sound proud like that before yesterday. I've basically lived in poverty for the past 15 years and felt like shit about myself for so long, I think my life is turning around at last. I got my ADD diagnosis at 27, why my countless doctors didn't think to even consider ADHD even though my journal from when I was 18ish stated I had severe concentration issues is beyond me. I'm a girl and not hyper and got good grades, I guess I didn't show the usual warning signs, but still. I'm basically Dory from Finding Nemo.  In Sweden we have a version of the SATs that you can take twice every year, and you can use the score to apply for educations. 34% of the spots avaliable are allocated to people using the SAT score (so 20 spots on the psychology programme), the rest of the spots are given to people with the highest grades. A year ago I did he test and scored higher than 99% of the people that took the test and it allowed me to get into basically any education in Sweden. (You need straight As to get in otherwise and I don't have that.) The psychology programme was listed today in the local paper as the hardest to get into out of 200 programmes at the university of Gothenburg, I feel proud as hell. It's such a strange feeling.  Don't give up people! I'm well over 30 now and I feel like my life is just beginning, it took me a long time to get here and that's okay. We may fall down over and over but if we don't stop trying we'll eventually get somewhere better. For the first time ever I feel hope for my future. I just wanted to share this, the struggle has been overwhelming and I know you all understand how hard it can be. I did it guys, I finally did it.
