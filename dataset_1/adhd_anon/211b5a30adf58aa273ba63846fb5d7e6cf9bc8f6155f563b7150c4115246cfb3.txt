It's kind of like the US collectively got a taste of what ADHD is like. My brain wants results from whatever it is I'm doing NOW, and when it takes longer, like maybe an hour, it's just so exhausting waiting to see the fruits of my labor.   So, Americans just got a taste of what ADHDers go through literally every hour. It's just continual exhaustion (apart from when we get lucky and hyper-focus).
