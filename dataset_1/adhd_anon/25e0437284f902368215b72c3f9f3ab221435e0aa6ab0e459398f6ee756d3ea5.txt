25e0437284f902368215b72c3f9f3ab221435e0aa6ab0e459398f6ee756d3ea5;;;TIL The average person falls asleep in 15 - 20 minutes;;;I always assumed \~1 hour was normal, and my 2-4 hours was quite long, but REALLY? 15 minutes on average? HOW? Does the brain just shut up when your head hits the pillow? Do you conveniently forget about everything you haven't finished today, and everything you need to do for the rest of the week? Do you not have a vivid story that you need to create in your head every night? It genuinely sounds fake to me, I just cant wrap my head around it.  \[edit\] My phone hasn't stopped buzzing with notifications since i posted this. Help. This was a mistake lol
