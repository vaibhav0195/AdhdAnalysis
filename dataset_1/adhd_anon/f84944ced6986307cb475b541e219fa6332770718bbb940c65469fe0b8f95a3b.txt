Literally out of sight, out of mind.  This leads to large amounts of rotted vegetables, cold coffee, and having JUST run out of this thing i really need right now.  To combat this I set myself booby traps.   For example if I happen to notice that my shampoo is running low, I'll set the bottle in the middle of the bathroom floor so that once I'm dressed and ready for my day I will quite literally trip over it, thus reminding me I need to order more.  I often move foods in front of beverages in the fridge so that I have to interact with them, reminding me that I bought Jicama for a reason! Or I will set my meds at an odd angle to remind myself I haven't taken them yet. My house is chock full of items in odd places to help jog my memory along.  What reminders do you have to help with object permanence?  Edit: You are all too kind.  You have given me some great tips to better "trap" myself!   Thank you all very much!!     Also, edited spelling because ADHD hit post too quickly
