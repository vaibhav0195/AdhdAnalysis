Yeah, dopamine, the ‘feel good’ hormone. My brains normal state is feeling somewhere between ‘really shitty’ and ‘not quite right’ on the comfort and happiness meter. This causes my brain to uncontrollably look for sources of dopamine through distraction and/or action, and also causes uncontrollable dis-regulation of my emotions. There are many other symptoms, and all can vary between different people. It is constant and ever-present to varying degrees. It can be treated primarily with medication, but lifestyle, diet and exercise can also have minor positive effects. It cannot be cured.”    Edit: Gold, Wow! Um.. Thanks kind stranger?  I know there’s a lot in there that’s not necessarily scientifically accurate but if we’re trying to explain to everyday people, I think/hope this is a good way to get the main points across and give people a much better understanding as quickly as possible.   As an aside, if the ‘ADHD’ term has already been broached, I also like to start with something like “Yep ADHD, and it’s nothing like what you think, it has nothing to do with mis-behaving kids It’s incredibly *under* diagnosed, affecting up to 15% of all people.”   Edit 2: thanks for the kind words. You guys are my people. :)
