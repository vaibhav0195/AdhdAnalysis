a98d5972cd1376f17a7ce9d10c2226f2cec3b2f6f73ca3605c989c04ea7b7cb6;;;I am starting a new relationship with someone who also has ADHD, and it is hilarious;;;We were just on the phone right now, and destiny made us be in a hyperactive / excited / "LET'S GOOOO" phase at the same time.Shit's hilarious, we couldn't stop talking and share deep personal issues and discussions on life at an alarming speed of speech, for absolutely no reason. I also see that both of us are shamed when this happen, but because we both have it, we can be cool with it.   Does anyone else have a cool relationship with someone who also got ADHD ?  Edit : this post blew up and my adhd ass is answering to every single comment, sorry for being a weirdo.  Edit2: my crazy brain answered to every comment but now I need to sleep. Thanks for the sweet dopamine ♥️. Love my adhd mates
