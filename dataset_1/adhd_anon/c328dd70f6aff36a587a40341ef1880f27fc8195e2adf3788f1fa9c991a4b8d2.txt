For my last exam I had to learn latin. I tried the university-courses, but they were too fast for me. So I studied latin on my own, for about 1 year, with a lot of breaks and crying inbetween.  And now I can get my bachelor, after 6 years instead of 3.  We might need more time, but we can make it. =)
