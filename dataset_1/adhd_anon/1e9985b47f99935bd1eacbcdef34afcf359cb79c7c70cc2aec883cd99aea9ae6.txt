1e9985b47f99935bd1eacbcdef34afcf359cb79c7c70cc2aec883cd99aea9ae6;;;Was waiting for my boyfriend's giant beer box Christmas gift to arrive. Doorbell rings so I sent him to the other room lest he hear or see anything. Turned out it was just a package for next door - so I turned and yelled "DON'T WORRY BUB IT WASN'T THE BEER, YOU CAN COME BACK NOW!" ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€;;;*How* exactly did it take me 27 years to get diagnosed???  Edit: woahhhh, went off Reddit for a few days and just came back to this! Honestly I was so mad at myself immediately afterwards that I cried - now all your replies have me laughing my butt off. Thank you for all being present-ruining morons, too.
