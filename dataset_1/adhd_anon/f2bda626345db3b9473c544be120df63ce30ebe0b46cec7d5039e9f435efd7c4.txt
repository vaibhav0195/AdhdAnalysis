But hitting me with, “You? You don’t have that!” after I’ve just confided in you... who gave you the authority to decide??  Here’s some of those gems:   — “Then *everyone* has ADHD.”  — “Who gave you that diagnosis? It’s bullshit.”  — “Oh, did you self-diagnose?”  — “Inability to commit to projects? Bad time management? Ha, those aren’t real symptoms.”  — “I used to work at a psych ward [as a teacher, not a doctor], I know what *real* ADHD looks like.”  — “How many shrinks did you go to to get that diagnosis? You’re only doing it for the drugs.” [Funny thing, I’m not taking any ADHD meds.]   Edit: oh yeah, another one I heard: “don’t go taking those meds now, you know you can train yourself to get rid of your symptoms, right?” Thanks Karen, I’ll just yoga them away, I guess.   ^(This post was brought to you by my lovely aunt, who said most of these things to me the other day.)
