Since I'm dyslectic and English being my second language, I do apologize for the inevitable grammar/spelling mistakes. But without further ado:  Since I have both ADD + dyslexia some things listed might not apply to you.  * Precursor: Medication: This has made it possible for me to have the energy to keep up with the work. And not completely crash in to a comatose after a couple of days work.  I know some people are vary of this, and to each their own. But I've gone from a student with F in almost all subjects (with the exception of Math and English), to an almost straight A student. And I couldn't have done it without medication, contrary to some belief.  *What most people seem to forget is that all ADD/ADHD is not equal.*  There's a big difference between the severity for each individual, thus saying one ought or ought not use medication is a useless debate if you're not the persons psychiatrist.  (*This also applies to possible side effects)*.  * First, For the distraction: One thing I've learned early on is to accept that since I'm both impulsive and easily distracted by the environment. I wont get any studying done in an environment which promotes the two. Thus when I study, I don't do it at home for the most part. But I'll leave the house and go to the library and or the school and try to find as remote a room as possible.  *  Secondly: I use the app (Forest) which locks my phone from opening other apps for the duration of my choosing (I usually set it to 25 minutes). Thus when I start a pomodoro-pass the only thing I'll do is to study.  **However and this is important!** When I feel like I can't continue (Notice that I didn't say if! :D), and that too I'm tired. I simply just sit still, stare at the wall or close my eyes for a minute or two, but I won't stop the timer.  Because most often after 2-3 minutes of this, I'll get bored and continue studying. And it helps feeling a bit guilty for not studying while the tree is still growing! hehe :)  *  Third: I have snacks with me for small boosts of energy. As Dr. Russell A. Barkley pointed out in the lecture (ADHD: Essential Ideas for Parents), our brains are one of two organs which use sugar as an energy source.  ***However this does not mean you ought to eat plenty***.  For example I take Dextrose-Energy tablets once and hour or after each Pomodoro, and throughout the day I'll eat fruits etc.  *  Fourth, and this is for reading: When I read things, the text gets all jumbled up and so the meaning gets lost in translation. But instead of reading a passage over and over again.  I noticed that when I wrote down everything on paper while reading it. The text became more coherent and I could easily find when I started to jumble up the text. Since what I was writing didn't make any sense!!!  Yes this takes (3x) as long.  However so does re-reading a text over and over + I don't get as easily bored.  * Fifth: Let's say you have a lecture in biology, philosophy or what have you. And it's about an hour long on YouTube or something akin to it.  What I've found to be a good hack, is open like 5 different lectures on the same topic.  So when I get that deep feeling of unease that I can't continue.  Instead of stopping completely, I'll open up another lecture. And eventually I'll have watched 5 instead of none!  * Sixth: Break down the task: Since procrastination is also largely due to emotion regulation. Whenever I'm presented with a large assignment I get the so called "Ostrich effect" of wanting to bury my head in the sand and pretend that it isn't there.  Therefore when I get a big assignment, I will just read the questions and take a day or two (if I have the time) to ponder the questions. And try to think how I might be able to break down the tasks into smaller steps. I.e Today or this Pomodoro pass I will write a sentence or two.   * Lastly: Remember to treat yourself as a reward when finishing a task. The reward can be whatever you choose. But it's good to then have bigger reward for instance at the end of a semester.   For example: If I can complete this year without failing a subject I will buy myself a (X).  However "If don't succeed", I will forgive myself and be happy that I did my best!  So let's buy a (Y) instead, or simply go on a nature hike or whatever floats your boat.    TLDR: ***Cough***  1. Choose a discreet location for your studies.  2. Study using the Pomodoro technique with the Forest app: (https://www.forestapp.cc/),  or something akin to it.  3.) Snacks and food for continues energy when working/studying.  4.) ***For Dyslexia***: Write what you read, this has been more easy (at least for me) to remember and comprehend the text.  And then as a bonus I use that book as an extended working memory and keep it with me! So whenever I/You get that feeling of yeah, I recall (x) person saying something like that. Wait, Tadaa!! Now you simply can just open up book and look up their name!  5.) Open a bunch of different tabs with similar subjects/or lectures:  So that instead of stopping what you're doing, when you get that deep sense of unease that you can't continue. Instead of jumping between unrelated subjects. They will relate to the task at hand and eventually you will have completed them all!! Yay us :D  6.) Breakdown: No not mentally, since we've have plenty of those already. But break down the tasks in baby steps, make a game out of figuring out how one might go about breaking down the task. Instead of saying I need to write 10 pages by (x day). Instead, we can say "Today I just need write a sentence or two".   7) Last but not least! Treat yo self fool! Whether that is diddling with your privates or someone else's. Eating something delicious, or buying the master-blaster mega disaster water cannon that you've always wanted.  Or perhaps, if you're as annoying as me and find joys in trying to teach others what you've learned go for it! (P.s nature hikes is an excellent tactic to make it harder for your friends and family to escape your shenanigans!)   Hope that helps! But I will be honest with you. Yes this takes longer than for most people.  And so I won't have as much free time as others, so I would be lying if I said it wasn't hard from time to time.  That's why it is important to remember that when It might be to much, is to take a longer well earned break! So that we can feel more like a human every now and then! (If possible, hehe :)  Last but not least! Even though it's hard working towards my goal of helping others (I'm trying to become a neuroscientist).  The pain now is nothing in comparison to doing nothing at all. (Or at least that's what it felt like).  P.S: I would love it if any of you wrote back to me if any of my tips helped.  But also if you want me to elaborate more on a point.   ///Kind Regards, Ankianka.
