39cb7fa36bd11cac281f2af2d084a04657e277d402c9591c4437808e47407702;;;just took meds for the first time;;;is THIS how everyone else’s brains work??? i just did 3 assignments in a row and it wasn’t even hard. i literally just picked what i needed to to, started them, planned how i was going to do them, and then i DID THEM. my brain is so quiet. i can’t believe i’ve been thinking i was just bad at doing what everyone else could.
