Women with ADHD are 8x more likely to attempt suicide, while men with ADHD are 4.5x more likely; parental violence and substance dependence increase the prevalence of suicide attempts.;;;[https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-12/uot-oif121520.php](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-12/uot-oif121520.php)  I’ve included some paragraphs I found interesting below.   University of Toronto  Manuscript DOI: 10.1080/13811118.2020.1856258  A nationally representative Canadian study reported that the lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts was much higher for women who had ADHD (24%) compared to women who had not (3%). Men with ADHD were also more likely to have attempted suicide compared to men without ADHD (9% vs. 2%)  Because ADHD is more common among men than among women, little research or clinical attention has focused on women with the disorder. In this study, women with ADHD had more than twice the odds of suicide attempts compared to men with ADHD.  Adults with ADHD who had been exposed to chronic parental domestic violence had triple the odds of suicide attempts compared to their peers with ADHD who had not experienced that childhood adversity. Parental domestic violence was defined as "chronic" if it had occurred more than 10 times before the respondent was age 16.  “We speculate that violent parental conflict may cause extreme stress for the child with ADHD and predispose these individuals to mental illness and suicidal thoughts. In addition, the challenges of raising a child with ADHD who is struggling with severe mental health issues may cause parental conflict, which may escalate into domestic violence."  The study examined a nationally representative sample of 21,744 Canadians, of whom 529 reported they had been diagnosed with ADHD. Data were drawn from the Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health.
