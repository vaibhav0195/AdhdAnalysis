On the other side, ADHD fucking sucks and I can see someone with ADHD making that claim to feel a bit better about this awful curse.  It's true that some of us are able to think in different and creative ways that can work out well for us in certain jobs or projects. What many NT people don't understand is that these ways of thinking are advanced coping mechanisms for some really debilitating core issues.  I know you fuckers love a good analogy so here's some equivalent "super powers" to help people understand ADHD.  -Having absolutely incredible balance...because you only have one leg.  -Being great at fixing things...because everything you own is broken.   -Having a really high pain tolerance...because you've always had a crippling headache.   -The ability function for days without resting...because you have nightmares every time you sleep.  -Being able to run faster than anyone else...because you're constantly being ambushed by wolves.  -Feeling hot no matter how cold it is...because you're on fire.  -Having great night vision...because you've never seen daylight.  Anyone else feel like this?
