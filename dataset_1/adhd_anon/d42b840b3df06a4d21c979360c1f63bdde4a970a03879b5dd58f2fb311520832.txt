I'm sorry for getting frustrated when you have a hard time making decisions. I'm sorry for giving you the annoyed look when you interrupt me to tell me something you remembered just so you won't forget. I'm sorry for ever acting/mentioning you act "different" when you're on your medicine. I'm sorry for not being more understanding, and supporting you like I should. I was someone who didn't take ADHD as serious as I should have, and I am so sorry for that. Thank you for sharing the videos and links to help me further understand- have more of an insight and would genuinely like to apologize for any stress that I have caused you in the past. We are opposites in a lot of ways, but I fell in love with you for you, and that will never change.  I know you browse this subreddit, and hope this makes it to you.
