I thought that I had to be a particular way to be ADHD- everyone I knew who had ADHD made me feel like I couldn't possibly have the same thing as them.  To everyone seeking diagnosis: it's a SPECTRUM. And just because someone else is ADHD, doesn't mean you will be the very same, have the same problems, and get along like two peas in a pod.  Remember that your symptoms are REAL, and that ADHD does not account for personality differences.  **TLDR; ADHD is variable.**  **Edit**: I've been reading every comment (even if I didn't reply) and I'm so glad I'm not alone- you guys are really nice and its been interesting reading about what problems you face (like driving!).  1. Yes "spectrum" is a misnomer, but I've seen it applied to ADHD hence it's use in this post. It's more like a series of clusters, if you prefer literal imagery. 2. ADHD is not a competition. If someone else in your life "has it worse" it doesn't discount your own symptoms and struggles.
