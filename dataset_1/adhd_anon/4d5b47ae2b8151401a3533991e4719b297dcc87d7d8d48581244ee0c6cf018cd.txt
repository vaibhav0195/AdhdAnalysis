I feel like apologizing perpetuates some of that good ol’ ADHD shame.;;;I certainly do the “sorry” thing in my life but I’m thinking on this sub, do we have to apologize? Chances are the people reading your post or comment have ADHD and so there is an unspoken understanding.   I know this is a habit and some habits aren’t easy to break. I think it’s totally fine to do the  “sorry” thing if it makes you feel comfortable. This suggestion is mostly a challenge to stop apologizing for being ourselves and having our ADHD quirks.
