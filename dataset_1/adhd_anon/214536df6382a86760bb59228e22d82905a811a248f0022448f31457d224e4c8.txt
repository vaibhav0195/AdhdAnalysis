I may not answer to yall, but please let it be known that Ive read every single response Ive got. I just wanna say that, is thanks to communities like this one that I got the courage to insist on what was wrong with me... all of u are wonderful people n I can only wish u happiness n luck on ur personal journey with ADHD ðŸŽ‰âœ¨ .   .   so! for a bit of context: Im a 23 y/o who was been dealing with alot of the symptoms of ADHD my whole life, investigated n researched about it... but no matter with who I talked to, no one would believe me; in fact, most people categorized me as "smart, but lazy and distracted" to the point I started to believe it (and as byproduct, developed depression at the sweet age of 13)  it wasnt until I was 19 that my psychologist at that time noticed something was different with me, and told me that I probably suffered from ADHD. the problem was that, before she could confirm anything, I stopped going since my dad thought I was already better and, me being me, didnt think much of it.  now, 23, going to college and having dealt with a lot of problems regarding procrastination, lack of focus, overstimulation and many more things; starting to believe that the problem was me being a failure and never living to the expectations of everyone around me... I can finally be at peace that it wasnt me, I just didnt have the right diagnosis. I can finally start to make a positive change in my life!    tl;dr: after years of dealing with ADHD and people not believing me, I finally got the right diagnosis
