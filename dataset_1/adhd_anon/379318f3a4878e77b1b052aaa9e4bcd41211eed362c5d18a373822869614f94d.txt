379318f3a4878e77b1b052aaa9e4bcd41211eed362c5d18a373822869614f94d;;;do i suck at responding to people’s messages because i have adhd or am i just rude;;;i’ve always wondered if this was an adhd thing or just me being a dick, cuz i genuinely cant come up with a solid excuse to why i cant respond to people within a decent time.   i am ALWAYS on my phone so i know when someone messages me and what it says, but for some reason i absolutely canNOT bring myself to respond when i should.   sometimes when i get a notification i’ll think of a way to respond, and then think of a better/ more clever response, and then another until something else catches my attention and i end up googling something for an hour and totally forget about the text  but most of the time i just think about the possibility of them responding really fast and get totally turned off by the thought of having to engage in a conversation for like five minutes because then theyll know im on phone and i’ll have no excuse to not respond.   i also tend to overthink HOW exactly to respond so when people reply fast i get really flustered and end up taking longer than i should to type out a simple sentence   overall i’d say im just really avoidant of my messages. i pretend i do not see it. hours will turn into literal days and then it gets to the point where i feel like its more rude to respond so late  adderall usually helps but not really in a social aspect, its more the feeling of needing to get everything done cuz the unread messages do weigh on me, so i’ll end up responding to everyone all at once while im still wired  so yeah i was just wondering if its normal for adhd peeps or if im just being super antisocial and rude. any tips?
