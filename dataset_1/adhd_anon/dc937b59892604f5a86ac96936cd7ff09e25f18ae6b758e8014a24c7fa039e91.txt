Every time someone tries to "tough love" me and motivate me through pointing out that I'm an adult and i need to "pull myself up" i instantly feel worse and even less motivated to do stuff. I wonder if anyone else on here noticed that.  [Edit to add] Guys i have a really warm and fuzzy feeling right now of finally having so many people i can relate to. Thank you for all the responses.
dc937b59892604f5a86ac96936cd7ff09e25f18ae6b758e8014a24c7fa039e91;;;It’s a constant state of “Idgf right now” or “How did I allow things to get this bad?!?” for me. No in between. No normalcy.;;;I know I’m not adulting right, I’ve neglected so much that needs to get done. Haven’t filed taxes in 4 years, can’t handle my finances, I’d fire myself if I was my boss and picture that day happening daily....I should be stressed out and overwhelmed, but my ADHD won’t allow me to care or feel any sense of panic until I’m in imminent danger of ruining my life, or something drastic has already happened...  I wish I could explain it to neuro typicals. How much of a challenge it is to bring myself to do the bare minimums, I can’t do shit without some sort of assistance, motivation or supervision. Let to my own devices I am useless.   But in this world I just have to hide, keep playing the role of “having it all together” game while every second of every day I’m reminded of what a shit show my life is and has been.  EDIT: I’ve been so overwhelmed by the amount of messages and comments this post has received that it brought me to tears a few times.  I wrote it at a moment I felt total despair and frustration and could see no way out. It’s bittersweet that so many can relate, because I do not wish how I feel and have felt on to anyone but being understood feels wonderful. I’ve been reading all the kind words and encouragement to me and others, as and the advice (especially those related to my taxes) and will act up on them, I promise.   I Wish I knew you all and could have you as my family, friends and colleagues instead of the judgmental neurotypicals we are outnumbered by; but this will do. THANK YOU!!

I thought we were good friends!!!   I was so childish that at 11 years old when i spoke to someone for like 2 months... i thought we were bestfriends and i even made a birthday card for them saying happy birthday best friend! They did not feel the same...  I thought people liked me. But just because everyone knows who you are, doesent mean that you are popular. I moved to a new school and when i saw the way these kids were treating another new kid, i realised that i was actually being bullied.  They spoke to him and made him talk a lot, pretending to be nice but they laughed at his actions behind his back and were mean. They made him do things that they found funny, it was funny to them that he thought they were friends.  My old classmates, they didnt like me, they spoke to me and interacted with me as a joke. As a way to make fun. We werent best friends, they misled me and used me as a joke.   I was annoying and they actually hated me. They all went out but never invited me out. That was already a huge warning sign. It did not help that i was atleast 2 years younger than everyone else.  I only had a few close friends... but everyone else hated me, i just wanted to be popular! I literally remember bragging to my family that i was popular... but just because they talk to you, doesent mean you are friends.
dc937b59892604f5a86ac96936cd7ff09e25f18ae6b758e8014a24c7fa039e91;;;Have you ever met someone you just click with, have everything in common with, and feel so at home with them, and then realize they have ADHD as well, and think "Oh, that makes sense."?;;;From the heading above the title space:  >You are submitting a text-based post. Speak your mind. A title is required, **but expanding further in the text field is not.** Beginning your title with "vote up if" is violation of intergalactic law.  Then below after I press submit (without any text in the body), it says:  >Post body must contain text. Post body must contain text.   Pick one.    I'm using my 'body space' to question another horribly formed subreddit rule.  Cheers r/ADHD  **Actually, fuck it, here's some body:**  There's a girl at work who I met on my first day who just instantly gravitated towards me for some reason and since then we've spent a lot of time together.  She's really shy but is an open book once I get her talking.  We share A LOT of similarities, always have the best time together and the best conversations, and I couldn't for the life of me figure out how this girl could be everything I could ever ask for and knock me on my ass so easily.  Then she told me she has ADHD and I was like "ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh", and then it clicked.  "That's why you're such a breath of fresh air - because you get it.  You get me.  You don't know I have ADHD but you're somehow pressing all the right buttons, and now I know why I'm so comfortable and happy and feel so at home when I'm around you".  **EDIT** If I've learned one thing from this thread, it's that we all need to hang out sometime.
dc937b59892604f5a86ac96936cd7ff09e25f18ae6b758e8014a24c7fa039e91;;;A useful technique I learned in my weird acting class that helps me stop racing thoughts with ADHD;;;Hi everyone,  I signed up for a local acting class (I’m not an actor, I just like to try things) at the repertory theater and didn’t realize it was actually a method acting class, which was strange to encounter as an outsider but I’m lucky it was! The acting coach followed the [Stanislavski method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislavski%27s_system).  Our homework on the first day was to bring a task from home that we needed to do and do it in front of the class as if nobody was watching. The next week we had to do a task we had never done before while the class watched, and the week after we had to do a task we had done before as if we had never done it before. For the first, I painted my toes. For the next, I tried building a bird house. And the last, I braided my hair.   What I learned is that a way I can focus on only what I’m doing and forget the audience is to constantly follow "steps" in each task I’ve made for myself. After braiding my hair, I realized how interesting this was for someone with severe adult ADHD. What I learned is that *if I approach a task as if I’ve never done it before and follow each step like it is new, I forget about everything else.*   Lately, I’ve found my thoughts racing to the point I can’t really keep up with myself. The way I can get it to slow down is if I concentrate on the steps to a task as if it’s new. It’s kind of like what they call "monkey mind" in Zen Buddhism. If you give the monkey something to pick apart, it allows you to directly experience life without the dissatisfying interruption of anxious thoughts.  Hope this helps!

I will probably reach out for a diagnosis eventually, but I am dying to understand a bit better about myself and why I am this way.   So for those who know they have ADHD, have you struggled socially to keep up with friends? I often find myself overwhelmed by getting maybe 9 snapchats or 5 texts at at time, and I'll put off answering these messages for at least a few hours to a day or so.   Is this just an antisocial trait? Or does ADHD contribute heavily to this?
dc937b59892604f5a86ac96936cd7ff09e25f18ae6b758e8014a24c7fa039e91;;;The analogy that finally got my colleague to understand...;;;I was chatting with a work colleague this morning while making tea, and he saw me pop my morning pill as I took my first slurp from the mug... so naturally we got onto the subject of ADHD.  This is the analogy I used to describe it:  "Imagine a big bowl of spaghetti, that's my natural thought processes.  Each task that needs to be done during the day is a single strand of spaghetti, and these strands need to be unravelled before work can be done, and then consumed individually so as not to get tangled up again.  Also, if I get interrupted while unravelling, all remaining work tangles up into one big mass again.  And potentially more spaghetti now surrounds it, so the original strands are completely buried and forgotten about.  The hardest part however, is not so much the actual unravelling, but finding the ends of the spaghetti so I can even get started.  If I get interrupted or distracted, the ends get lost."  "So what does the tablet help with?"  "Mainly, it helps to highlight the ends of the strands.  It doesn't help much with the actual unravelling process, I'm actually quite good at that - once I've found the ends!  God knows, I've had plenty of practice, I've been unravelling all my life."  I think that sums it up quite nicely.  Keep unravelling,  Jon - ADHD (Primarily Inattentive)
dc937b59892604f5a86ac96936cd7ff09e25f18ae6b758e8014a24c7fa039e91;;;Some days, I honestly feel like I'm too sensitive for this world.;;;I don't really know a better way to put it, but it's a strange feeling. I have a good life here in the U.S. and live with my parents, just got diagnosed around a year ago (Meds have helped me immensely).  I don't know if this even an ADHD thing, but I've always been so damn sensitive about pretty much everything (criticism makes me feel worthless, I always have a nagging feeling that people are holding on to my mistakes and to every breakdown I've had, and think of me as a dumb emotional child, and see me as a very weak 23 year old man)  To compound onto the constant overload in my head about myself, I also have too much empathy (and I don't know if this is because I'm too emotional or everyone else is numbed out) but I feel great dread for others, and want to help everyone I meet (I've volunteered a lot in the past before this extreme depression took over) Even when I was volunteering I always thought that it was never enough to change things on a bigger scale and that made me even more upset. One thing I suspect is that I've never really dealt with hardship at all, I've always been well taken care of since I was born, and I've heard that sometimes you need to be homeless or hurt by someone to turn your empathy levels down (and I definitely don't want that.)  I feel helpless to changing anything and it makes me feel like life is really pointless sometimes, I don't think I could handle ending up at a dead end job just making enough to get by, living in some trashy apartment. I fear my country is diving head first into some kind of Orwellian dystopia and that concerns me greatly. All I want is to live somewhere where it doesn't feel wrong to care about others. I don't want to feel so broken anymore for showing emotion and then be berated for it by everyone I know. I'm far from perfect and yes I realize that I had it made growing up, but that doesn't discount my emotions. I'm allowed to feel, dammit.  I don't know what this rant is but I just feel such a whirlwind of emotions all the time and it's so fucking exhausting.  Edit: My goodness, this community is so amazing. I've never felt more comfortable in my own skin while reading these comments. Thank you all, from the bottom of my heart!
