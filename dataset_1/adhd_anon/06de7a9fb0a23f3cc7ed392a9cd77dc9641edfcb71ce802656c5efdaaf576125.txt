06de7a9fb0a23f3cc7ed392a9cd77dc9641edfcb71ce802656c5efdaaf576125;;;Reminder: You definitely do have ADHD;;;Don’t listen to the people who don’t believe your diagnosis. Don’t even listen to yourself when you start to doubt it. “Mindfulness and meditation” may help but it is not a cure. Medication may help but it’s not a cure. Sometimes I start to think to myself “hm maybe I don’t actually have ADHD.” And then I’m late to work for 4 days in a row; despite waking up on time. And then I forget to clock out multiple days in the week; despite having worked here for years. And then I forget to do simple things like call my mom, or pay my rent, or I over-salt my eggs in the morning and think “oh yeah maybe I do have it.” It’s ok that you have ADHD but don’t forget that you have it. Don’t bully yourself into thinking you’re just lazy or not trying hard enough. If you found this sub I can almost guarantee that you have it.  Just a reminder in case any of you are feeling the way I’ve been feeling for the past few weeks.  *Edit:* Oof looks like the ADHD deniers have arrived😂
