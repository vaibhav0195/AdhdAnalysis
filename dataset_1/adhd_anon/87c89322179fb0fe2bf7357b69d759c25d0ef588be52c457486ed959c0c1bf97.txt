Understands that my messiness isn’t due to laziness or for lack of trying to be tidy. Comforts and helps me when i get frustrated with myself for not being able to find my hairbrush (for the 8th time that day) because I left it on top of the microwave, in the cupboard, etc etc etc. Doesn’t mind driving all the time because it’s safer for us. Reminds me to call friends and family back and on their birthdays / holidays. Treats me with politeness and care when I ask the same questions over and over. Understands that I try my best and still sometimes suffer.   TLDR: partner is amazing and is the key to feeling like I can live with what goes on in my brain. 10/10 would recommend this strategy when choosing a lifelong mate.  Edit: clarity  Edit 2: holy cow, so much love! I’m making my way to the responses. This community is so helpful ❤️
