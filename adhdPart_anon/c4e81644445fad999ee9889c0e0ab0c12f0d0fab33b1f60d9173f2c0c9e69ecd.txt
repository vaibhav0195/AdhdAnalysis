His parents are also now finally seeing how his ADHD affects his day-to-day life and trying to be supportive.   I’m so happy he has these people focused on his success now, but this comes after almost four years of me taking on most of these roles by myself and begging him to get help (for months he even lied to me and said he was going to therapy when he wasn’t).  For years he would hide his symptoms along with his anxiety and depression from everyone except me who often was on the receiving end of it all. This was especially true during times he was unemployed (he’s been laid off three times in the last year).   I endured so much abuse and gaslighting just trying to make him reflective of his own behavior and introduce accountability with no success, but now that people with advanced degrees are doing the same he is so receptive and calls them all geniuses. He has this whole team that he is crediting with his recent success, but he doesn’t see me as part of it. When I try to hold him accountable at home, I become the enemy. I’m either “pushing him too hard” or I just “don’t understand him”.   I’m so glad he’s getting the help he needs, but there’s still so much hurt from the past. I know he hates reflecting on the past, so even though he’s doing a bunch to work on himself and his own self compassion, I don’t feel like I’ll ever get the recognition or overdue apologies I deserve. I also don’t know how much more patience I have to be in an unfulfilling relationship while he “works on himself”. Wondering if we both wouldn’t just benefit from starting fresh with other people.
