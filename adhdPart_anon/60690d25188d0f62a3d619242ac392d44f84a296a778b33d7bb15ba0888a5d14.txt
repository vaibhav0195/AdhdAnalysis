I couldn’t sleep until 3 am last night because I felt terrible and was ruminating about all of this. I’m trying to make sense of a situation to determine what my next steps should be. If anyone is willing to read and provide advice, I would greatly appreciate it.   **Background**: My wife and I have been married 7 years, have 3 children (6, 3, 1), the 3 year old has pretty severe special needs (rare genetic disorder). I work two jobs year round and one contractual job that lasts about a month every July. My hours are down a little right now (COVID) and I probably  work about 50 hours/week on average - no more than I have to right now.  My wife stays home with the children and does not work. This was a mutual decision. She gets up with my daughter, who has sleep issues, for around 1 hour each night,. She spends a lot of time taking care of her, acts as her OT, PT, SLP, and teacher because everything is virtual for my daughter right now. It is a lot. My daughters issues coupled with a 1 year old definitely wear on her. My job can be stressful at times as well.  My **wife** is DX, medicated, and has been working on developing strategies to manage her ADHD through a facebook support group for individuals with ADHD.  My **sister-in-law** (SIL) is DX, medicated, but has not developed many strategies to manage her ADHD yet.  My **mother-in-law** (MIL) is NDX, not medicated. She did try my SIL’s Concerta once and remarked that it helped her be much more productive. She is 62 and seems to have developed some strategies to manage her ADHD, although I wouldn’t call her ADHD well managed.  I do not have ADHD. I have suffered from anxiety, depression, and body-focused repetitive behaviors most of my life. I have been in therapy for 6 months and am medicated for my mental illness and have made a lot of progress over the past year - but I still struggle. I have fairly serious trust issues probably stemming from childhood trauma.  **Situation**:   **April-May** \- **Quarantine** \- We lived with my in-laws. Although I absolutely did not want to, I did so because my wife needed help with the kids beyond what I could provide and we had lost all respite care and babysitters due to COVID. This was generous of my in-laws and I appreciate it. Everyone quarantined and worked from home, except my sister-in-law who was living there as well. Her exposure was limited at the time but higher than I was comfortable with- she saw her friends occasionally. I told my wife that my SIL, who has ADHD and has not developed significant coping strategies, is a huge risk to get COVID in part because of her ADHD and recklessness. She ended up testing positive for COVID in July.  **June - Death -** My MILs brother, wife’s uncle, was sick and had COVID symptoms. He has no immediate family and lives near my MIL. He was independent but my MIL checked up on him often. She knew he had COVID symptoms. According to my MIL, he told her that he called the doctor and the doctor said “You’re fine. You just need to rest at home. Don’t come in to the hospital.” My MIL did not check up on him again - no calling, visiting, etc. He lives 5 minutes from my MIL. I would never say this out loud, but in a small way, I think my MIL’s ADHD played a role in her brother’s death. He had been dead for a week in his apartment when someone else found his body. My MIL blames herself in part for not checking in on him and for not pressing the issue that he should seek medical attention. We found out from the medical examiner, who received his medical records, that his doctor actually told him it is likely COVID and advised him to seek immediate medical attention. He ignored that advice and lied to my MIL about it according to her. My in-laws have not disclosed the autopsy results.  **July - Positive COVID and Quarantine -** SIL tests positive. I predicted this back in April. She said “It was probably this random person I was talking to on the street who said they were sick.” That left me a bit stunned. We had to quarantine for 2 weeks and get a test (that nasal swab is terrible!). We continued to quarantine for 2 additional weeks because we had a family vacation planned with my in-laws and we wanted to be as cautious as possible so as to not expose my in-laws to COVID. Quarantine was hard because of my daughter’s special needs. On vacation we did not distance from each other, but were distanced from all others. As far as COVID, it was a fairly safe vacation.  **August - A Difficult Decision -** My wife and I had a thorough discussion and came to an agreement following vacation that our exposure going forward was high - not by choice - and that we should not see my in-laws until the situation changes and we can re-evaluate. My in-laws know that we are struggling daily to meet our needs and the needs of our children, so it was especially important for me, and my wife agreed, that we tell them explicitly that our exposure is too high right now for us to see them and that we can seek help elsewhere. We even told them that we should zoom more often, like we do with my parents, so that the kids can see them. I suggested fun Zoom activities. They have not yet really taken that up. We did not want them to help out and put themselves at risk just because we were struggling. I have been hiring baby sitters to come over to watch the kids so we can get caught up on chores and so that my wife can nap. My wife and I agreed that things are still tough but this works for us and is something we can deal with.  **September - COVID Exposure and Betrayal -**  MIL wanted to see her grandkids and I agreed that it would be okay, so long as she understood what our exposure is like. Also important to note that it is not possible for my 3 year old or 1 year old to wear a mask and  my MIL was picking them up and holding them right next to her face.   She came over on Tuesday morning. Tuesday afternoon I got a call that my son’s teacher had tested positive. I immediately called my wife and said “this is exactly the situation that I was trying to avoid. This is why I don’t think it is prudent for your mother to see us right now. Do you agree?“ She agreed with me. I said “Is this something that you want to talk to your mom about by yourself? Are we on the same page with this?” She replied yes. She told her that we shouldn’t see each other right now and told her about our son’s teacher testing positive. My MIL cried but said she understood.   Friday, my father-in-law asked me to call him. I called him and the essence of what he was saying was that my MIL is still sad over the death of her brother in July and that seeing the grandkids makes her happier. This was a brief conversation that we agreed to continue later as I was driving with my son in the car and it didn’t seem appropriate to discuss in front of him. My father-in-law was pressuring me to change our decision to not see them for the time being.   I said goodbye feeling very confused and uncertain about the situation. I didn’t understand why they are pressuring us to change our decision. I told my wife that I needed some time to talk to my parents, who we are also not seeing right now to avoid unnecessary risk. I wanted to get their perspective so I could make sense of the situation. I talked with my dad for about an hour and it helped. I then talked with my wife about it and said I just don’t understand why my FIL called me and pressured me and I don’t understand after the past few months why they can’t understand that we want to be cautious - after a COVID death, two positive tests, and two quarantines.   I literallly said to my wife “You and I are on the same page with this. Why wouldn’t they talk to you first?” Eventually, my wife confessed that when she talked with her mom she told her “If it were just up to me, we would keep seeing you.”  That was not what we discussed when I talked with my wife about the situation. She never once told me that she felt that way. So, I just learned that my wife was not honest with me, undermined me to her parents, and I feel like she essentially told her parents “this is my husbands fault.” I have trust issues and this has sent me in a bit of a tail-spin. I don’t know how to proceed except truthfully with all parties. I’m not sure how to feel about my wife right now. I feel betrayed, lied to, undermined, and I’m not sure how to start trusting her again.  If you have read this far - thank you. I don’t think I have ever written a post so long! If you have any thoughtful advice I would sincerely appreciate it. My feelings are very confused right now.
