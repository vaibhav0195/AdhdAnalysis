We have a child with medical a developmental diagnoses. I take care of our child full time. My ex knows how to take care of our child, medical equipment and all, but appears very anxious whenever he has had his parenting time. We had a bad time together after we got married and I stayed as long as I could. I’m primarily looking for a place where I can learn more and maybe pick up some new tools that will help with communication between us going forward. I found some things that work. Talking in person, unless I know exactly what and how I want to say something has been very difficult and it’s easy to feel like I’m having a completely different conversation than he seems to be having? Is it ok to join this group? If not, does anyone know of another group for me?
