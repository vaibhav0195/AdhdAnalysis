We stayed together for about 1/5 years.  Typical story where the first 6 months were amazing (the best) and after i started realizing the excessive talking and inattentive listening. Then we started with the fights. Fighting about things that didnt matter at all, just stuff that she came up with blaming me for things that i didnt do, not acknowledging all the help i was putting in place in order to maintain the relationship stable.  Felt also that i was the only pillar holding the relationship together, that I had to do everything, almost all the chores and all that.  She was taking meds but I think the doctor was giving her depression meds, and the ADHD wasnt being treated. That´s what i felt anyways.  Then recently, she had one of those impulsive hurtful comments that not even my worst enemy would say it to me and I feel like people should be responsible for the shit they say regardless of any issues. That one broke my heart in a way that i´ve never imagined.  I have never loved anyone as I love her, but I made the decision to end because i felt i lost the values of who I AM. I lived the last 2 years of my life emotionally supporting her, but I felt like I had very little support back and in my humble opinion, relationships should be equal compromise from both parts.  Now im feeling like shit, guilty and still very unhappy. Anyone has been through this to let me know how long until I start feeling better ?  Thanks,
