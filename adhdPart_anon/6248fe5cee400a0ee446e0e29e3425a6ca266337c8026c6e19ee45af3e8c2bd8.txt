I don't know how to work around this increasingly difficult obstacle. I will say something to my partner (no treatment) and it most always becomes an argument.   I ask to have what I said repeated to make sure we're in the same page & I have yet to have it repeated back accurately. They will insert assumptions on what I am thinking, how I am feeling, and what I am doing that's often a 180 from the original statement.   If I attempt to correct it I am met with one of two things. Either they will openly separate themself from the conversation (physically or mentally) with no intention of approaching it later on *or* I never get a chance to correct it because every word out of my mouth is drowned out by their defensively repeating the same misinformation I heard from them the first time.   I don't see any way around this so if anyone has tried something that has worked for them I'd be interested to hear it.
