He isn't diagnosed but I am about 90% sure.   I'd love to hear what people who have been with their ADHD partners long term would tell their younger selves before getting into the relationship? What expectations did you have at the beginning that have had to change? What mistakes were made? Unexpected struggles/challenges? But also the unexpected delights of being with someone with ADHD?
