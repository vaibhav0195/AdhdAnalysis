He is the life of the party, extremely extroverted, always cracking jokes at everything. and I mean everything. This is great when he's just a friend of yours, when you get all of the fun none of the burden, but I am starting to lose my patience. I cannot stand making jokes at everything, I don't need all the things to be funny. I am struggling to have a deep conversation while he just cuts it off with a witty comment and I'm left with all these unspoken thoughts, but for him the topic is finished and he needs to move on to the next one. I am an introvert and I'm passionate for deep and long conversations about the tiniest details so I can understand a certain topic thoroughly. For him this is just boring. He is an intelligent creative person but talking about one thing for too long just makes him irritated, and I don't want to only be focusing on being funny and exciting when talking to him. I also feel that any problem that I have for him is just soo easy to belittle, not like he is not supportive but he never sees the whole picture with all the complications, he always oversimplifies it.  I feel exhausted with this. I feel like we are always just babbling about everything. The work, friends, food, usual stuff. But what I really love to do is having heated debates, arguing about movies or books, going through thought experiments.  Is it possible for him to not be bored by things like these? I love the quick wit and he's a great guy. But the golden-retriever-oversimplification gives me such a hard time sometimes.
