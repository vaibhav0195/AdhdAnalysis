I’m a lurker, and this week, something caught my eye. I’ve been reading some recent posts about Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD). Y’all ... it makes sense now.  My partner has diagnosed ADD, and I won’t be an armchair psychologist, but he does has some of the hallmarks of RSD: attempting to please everyone, when we discuss conflicts, he often takes it personally, saying things like “I’m worthless,” and many of our discussions end in him saying that his brain has shut down. I had no idea what that meant until now, and I’m still pretty foggy on what that feels like to him. Learning that there is a word for this and that many people with ADD and ADHD have it makes so much sense to me.  I am patient and I don’t escalate the situation. He’s never angry or violent towards me, although he does hit his own head sometimes. I do try to assure him that he isn’t worthless and try to have him stop hitting his head. I want to thank you guys for helping me learn what RSD is, and if anyone wants to share some suggestions, they’d be appreciated! I’m especially curious about how you guys handle your partners’ shutdowns. We’ve been together for 5 years but as you know, you’re constantly learning more about someone and how to work better together. I have asked that he consider going to therapy but he hasn’t made any steps towards that yet. I’m beginning to think that couples therapy could be a good idea.
