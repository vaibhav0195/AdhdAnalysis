Being the partner with ADHD many things have been trial and error.   But some of our biggest successes have come from a book called Fast Minds.  It has tips for people With ADHD and tips for people who know someone with ADHD.  It helps understanding for both sides and provides things for both parties to do.   Additional note:  Some community members from r/ADHD are reading this book as a "book club" so to speak to discuss topics.  If anyone would like to be a part as an active participant or to be a fly on the wall and see how we function and discuss please feel free to message me and we will coordinate.  :)  Edit: If your DX/NDX wants to join they are welcome!  But for the best of the group and the DX/NDX please do not attempt to make anyone join.   - anyone is welcome to just see/add ideas  - To join shoot me a message and I'll add you in!
