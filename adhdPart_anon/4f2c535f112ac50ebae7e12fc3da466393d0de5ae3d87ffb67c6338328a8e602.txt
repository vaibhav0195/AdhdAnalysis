I'm due to move in soonish with my other half, unmedicated ADHD, and would love ideas for things we can do that might make things easier?  I've seen suggested elsewhere stuff like laundry baskets with no lids to reduce the number of steps it takes to put dirty laundry in the right place - anyone have anything they've implemented in their home that has helped?
