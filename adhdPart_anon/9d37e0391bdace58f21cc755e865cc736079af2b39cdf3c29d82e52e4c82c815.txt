I have always had a hard time talking to friends and family about my relationship with my ADHD husband, they don't seem to understand. This community really has helped me feel heard and not alone. You folks really get it, and it makes all the difference.      Shoutout to all of us loving partners who are here researching to make our relationships better!   ♥️
