28bfd0accd8e1c0929c7afde3e99e223804171491bbe9cd0c0da0a4ca2b13cd7;;;To all people with adhd partners and relationship problems;;;Please do not make excuses for your partners shitty behavior.   Having adhd is one thing. I'm unmedicated, and I've worked my ass off for my partner to work on my problem behaviors related to adhd (and not related).  The amount of posts on here I see with people complaining about their partner, but their partner has not put **any** effort into fixing the problem, is insane.  &nbsp;    I am definitely not perfect but come on. Having adhd can't be used as a scapegoat for just being an asshole. If your partner has not put any effort into working on their problems, and those problems are significantly impacting your relationship, *move on.*   You don't need a relationship coach to tell you that if your efforts are not being matched, if the relationship isn't 50/50, then the relationship just is not and won't work.   Being an asshole (or whatever term) is one thing. being an asshole (or whatever term) and having adhd is another. You don't have to be an asshole just because you have adhd.    Just my two cents. You guys deserve someone better, adhd or not, who actually wants to work towards better behavior or habits
