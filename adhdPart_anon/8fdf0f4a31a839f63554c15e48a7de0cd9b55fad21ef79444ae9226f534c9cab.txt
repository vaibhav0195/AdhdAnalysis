8fdf0f4a31a839f63554c15e48a7de0cd9b55fad21ef79444ae9226f534c9cab;;;WE GOT AN APPOINTMENT!!!!;;;For a while, I couldn’t find anyone who specialized in ADHD and that was accepting new patients, and I finally FINALLY found someone today. My husband has a telehealth appoint in a couple weeks and I am SO excited!!!!! Yesterday, was one of the worst days for me, feeling overwhelmed and I think it scared him a lot. It was a mix of a breakdown and panic attack for me, where I was crying so bad I was hyperventilating. We’re both kind of emotionally exhausted today so finding a doctor couldn’t have come at a better time.  I’m so hopeful that this will be the help that we need for our only 7 month marriage.  Also just learned his brother is now being treated for it as well and takes meds for it so at least I know I can go to his brother’s wife to help me feel as sane as possible.
