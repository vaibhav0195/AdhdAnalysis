And it makes him feel like I don’t think he’s worth trying to empathize with.  I’m at a loss because 1) I truly can’t understand some of his reactions that are filtered through his ADHD / depressive lens, and 2) I’m sick of trying to understand where he’s coming from. But I want to stay married and keep our family together, so this is something I must do.   For background, I almost left him due to his terrifying emotional, angry outbursts that made me feel physically unsafe. This on top of emotional neglect, being a disengaged husband & father, and bringing a depressive cloud to sit on top of the household.  Because of this, he has been in intensive treatment for his ADHD and depression for around 8 months, and I am so proud of all the work he has done and improvements he has made. However, things are not perfect and of course never will be.  Part of my therapy has been to stop trying to be his at-home psychologist. I have let go of responsibility for his emotions, which has been a huge positive shift for me. Kind of like in Al Anon when you lovingly detach and stop counting the drinks your alcoholic loved one is drinking.   But on the other hand our marriage counselor is trying to encourage me to take responsibility for my role in our fights / arguments, and I find it almost impossible. I feel like I’m just constantly reacting to problems he is creating. And I don’t think I’m wrong. I’m sure this feeling is understood by this community.  So my question is... how do I have empathy for my ADHD husband??
