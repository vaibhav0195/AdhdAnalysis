14350877d9cfd8e527409ed8e5f92f7d9ac900d2258caf501b51f9c9dd0ff595;;;I finally left my partner of almost 4 years after having to call the cops on him.;;;I'm fucking terrified. He's in his mid 30s and undiagnosed/unmedicated. Just recently realized what's been afflicting him his entire life is ADHD.  Since day one, we've had countless fights. Explosive. Brutal. I've wanted to leave since the beginning, but he would always gaslight me, guilt-trip me into staying.   Yesterday he locked us both in a room during a fight and wouldn't let me out. He took my phone. He spat on me multiple times. I hit him when he blocked my way out the door.  I had enough. Finally, when I got out, I went to the neighbour and asked him to call the police to come escort me. Unfortunately that also resulted in him getting arrested.   I'm freaking out to a bit now. I'm scared he'll hurt himself. I don't know what to do to protect him but I can't be with him any longer...
