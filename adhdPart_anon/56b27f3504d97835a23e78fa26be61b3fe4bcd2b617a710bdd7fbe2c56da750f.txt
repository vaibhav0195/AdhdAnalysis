56b27f3504d97835a23e78fa26be61b3fe4bcd2b617a710bdd7fbe2c56da750f;;;I’m dying inside..;;;I’m (26f) recently diagnosed w/ ADHD and my husband (24m) non ADHD. We’ve been together for almost 10 years total and it’s been a rough 10 years I was diagnosed at around 20 with fibromyalgia so for years my husband had to help take care of me and now I’ve got my fibromyalgia figured out and don’t need his help.. we’ve always struggled when it comes to arguments I could never communicate right and I always thought it was my fibromyalgia so I kept making promises that I’d figure it out and I could communicate better and nothing I tried worked I still got over emotional couldn’t figure out what was wrong. A month ago I go told by our therapist I have ADHD I’m really realizing that this is why I never could communicate I’d get so confused by the argument and then just start babbling.. after years of or not communicating right my husband resents me he struggles daily with bad thoughts about my ADHD and it’s made it to we’re I loose my emotions they get so high I go crazy panicking and I don’t want him to divorce me but I know I’m pushing him away with my over emotions... it’s like I’m turning our disagreements into a blame game when I just feel like he doesn’t understand me. I’m hopeful going to see a doctor this week I really just want to be medicated so hopefully I can be normal... has anyone else had a really hard time with their marriage... I know this is a mess I just don’t know what to do..
