I don’t want to hear the, “have mercy on them” spiel as I repeat that daily—if not Hourly—to myself.  What I want to hear is Hope—hope that he Can change; hope from others success stories in being prioritized by their spouse, or, hire they make the sexless, neglectful, parent/child, “unfuckable roommates” marriage work for them.
