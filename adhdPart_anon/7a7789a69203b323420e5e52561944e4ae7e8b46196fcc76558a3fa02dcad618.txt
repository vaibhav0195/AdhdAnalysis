It is an eye-opening explanation of how our NT brains react and respond to the ADHD brain, and has tips and tricks to work within those headspaces.  It is written largely for the co-habitating NT so I think there are other books out there that use different, maybe somewhat softer language for those with ADHD who likely already feel like they're failing their partners, spouses, themselves, etc. but for those of us who walk around wringing our hands and shaking our heads, it's good to hear that we are not alone. It also gives ways to approach talking to our partners about therapy coinciding with meds, why meds matter, and how to best encourage them about both of those things (particularly valuable for those of us with partners who won't consider meds and/or therapy).  I highly recommend it, I'm only a few chapters in and I can tell it will help how I deal with my ADHD spouse.

Last night, I went to bed early so they could hang out together. This morning as Roy made us breakfast before Bob came down, Roy started to tell me what he witnessed Bob do the night before. But first, as Bob came downstairs, Roy asked Bob to hand him something from the fridge. I was on the couch watching TV and Bob grabbed the item then stood there watching the TV with the item in his hand for a long time (I didn't say anything, I just waited). Eventually, Bob says, "DUDE!" and Bob turns around to hand him the thing he fetched. They laughed.  When Bob went to the bathroom, Roy turned to me and said:  "I watched him open a beer, walk over there and set it down, then stop to watch the TV for a long while, then walk back to the fridge to grab another beer. I pointed out that he already opened one, he looked at it and laughed. Then he picked up a bag of snacks and stood there eating them at the counter, created a mess of garbage, and walked away from it without a thought. Then he said down on the couch and held the remote to change the channel, but just watched the TV for about five minutes before asking where the remote was. I pointed to it and he laughed again... is that what it's like?"  I just walked over to Roy, hugged him, and welcomed him to my world. He was astounded, he'd never seen it in real life before, and now he knows. Let the healing begin!

For the last month it's been like living with him before he was medicated and I've fallen back into the pattern of walking behind him to shut doors, turn off lights, put food back into the fridge, remind him of appointments, and try not to throttle him in his sleep. He apologizes, I tell him it's not on purpose and I get that, but it's difficult being back in the place of having to make sure doors are locked and the garage door is closed at night, etc.  Today he was supposed to go see his doc in order to have the meds re-adjusted and Adderall refilled. But he forgot. Because he didn't put it on the calendar. Because the Adderall isn't working anymore. They moved his appointment to five days from now, and I will welcome that day with open arms.   I marveled at how easy it was to change the appointment without penalty because, of course, they must have patients miss them all the time. Ahhh, you have to laugh.
