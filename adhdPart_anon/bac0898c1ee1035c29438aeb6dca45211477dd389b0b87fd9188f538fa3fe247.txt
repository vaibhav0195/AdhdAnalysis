That doesn't excuse denial of the disorder or not taking its impact on "us" seriously, but it helps to take a step back and think about how he might be feeling and how his current reactions / behaviors could be interpreted differently when the lens shifts from the effects of ADHD on us to the root pain and struggle he's experiencing.
