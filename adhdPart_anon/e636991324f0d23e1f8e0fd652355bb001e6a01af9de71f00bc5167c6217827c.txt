We’ve been quarantining together and he wants me to move in, but he’s so messy that idk if I can deal. He does stuff like cook and leave dishes out for days claiming he’ll get to it later, he lets dishes and clothes pile up in all places...when i try to talk to him about it he blames his ADHD and gets defensive (yes he’s medicated and takes it on schedule) it feels like an excuse if anything and like I’m the one responsible for cleaning constantly. We keep having fights about it and all he can say is “I’ll get better” but he isn’t doing anything to do so. I’ve gotten a White board to write reminders, ive texted them to him, I even did sticky notes all over the places in the apartment he goes to all the time. I don’t know what else to do, but I’m thinking of breaking up with him. I am exhausted trying to take care of him and everything then do my stuff too. It feels like I’m a mom taking care of a kid. Is this normal? Please help.
