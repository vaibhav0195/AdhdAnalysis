Since I realized what was going on with him I knew that unless he gets help, there was not much hope. So I started leading my life as independently as possible and turned to friends and family for help and support. But now with the pandemic he is working from home. I feel like I am trapped with an adult teenager. We have two little kids and own a home together. He does a few things for the kids and the house but other than that he goes about like it is all my problem. I had help from others to cope with everything I had to do as the responsibilities kept piling on me over the years (yes, I am an idiot, it took me years to finally understand what was going on with him...by then the kids and the house were in the picture), but now with the pandemic, those folks cannot even come over. I am bottling up without being assertive to keep the peace because he gets aggressive. I do not know how to get through this without exploding! I genuinely feel that dealing with him has been more challenging than facing the pandemic. Please help!!
