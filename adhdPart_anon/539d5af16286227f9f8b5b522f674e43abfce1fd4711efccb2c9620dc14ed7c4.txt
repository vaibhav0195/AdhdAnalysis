I was feeling frustrated / resentful that my ADHD husband has been tackling so many projects during quarantine (WHERE ARE THEY COMING FROM!? He's taken up woodworking, y'all. I don't even know.) and yet, things that have been on my own personal To-Do list for ages are still there, taunting me, even with all the "extra" time. It occurred to me that, *of course* he's getting more done than me. His ADHD brain only sees the things it wants to see. Whereas I can be working in the yard and think, "I really need to mulch the garden too. But, it's getting late. Not a good time to start that. Need to clean up these tools, shower, get kids to pick up their toys, prepare supper, eat supper, bathe children, put them to bed, and then hopefully have some time & energy to spend with my partner before we fall asleep..." He doesn't see any of that stuff. His full attention is on one thing, the latest addition to his home office. His sole focus and concern is, has been all day: build, sand, glue, paint. I always figured the struggle was for ADHDers to get anything accomplished, but in this case, he is able to hyperfocus on his hobbies and projects, at the exclusion of all those little demands & things that get in the way for neurotypical me.
