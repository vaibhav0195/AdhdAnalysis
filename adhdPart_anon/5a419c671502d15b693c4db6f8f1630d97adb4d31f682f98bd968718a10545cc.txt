I know it's really helpful to vent and process, especially at the time of new diagnosis. We're really moving forward and ADHD has gone from the most important crisis and biggest threat in our relationship to just another attribute about my wife's character. We're looking forward to buying a house and having kids.   I'm leaving because I don't really need to vent and rage anymore. I've done that. I'm past the denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and finally am in acceptance. I love my wife and expect we'll stay together.   Wanted to post this here with this message to remind y'all of a fact: people in these kinds of support groups are going through the worst part. Once you are in a better place, it can be draining, unpleasant, and even triggering to be in the presence of those suffering. There are probably millions of people that are married happily to an ADHD partner, they just aren't in here struggling anymore, they move on and move off the support groups once they don't need support.   Let this message serve as proof that I'm a happy success story, that things got better, and they can get better for you too.   All the best to everyone, goodbye!
