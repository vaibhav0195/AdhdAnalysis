I've made many mistakes, and have been struggling coming to terms with all the issues I bring along with me. Over the past couple months I have been connecting so many lines, and realizing just how bad of an emotional support I can be sometimes.  A couple of days ago, I set it in my head that I was going to really turn things around. I've been trying to keep myself under control, and keeping things at a pace where I can manage better. The thing is that it still feels like there is a huge weight of everything from the past and it's something that takes a huge toll on my partner. She doesn't feel like I deserve any more chances, and I don't blame her. There has been so much back and forth, and so many times where I ask for a second chance only to mess up again without even realizing it. I don't know if I DO deserve a second chance, but all I know is I don't want to cause her any more pain. I feel like I keep dragging her down.  I know it's not the same for someone without ADHD to just move forward and forget all the bad things and try to start new, and I was just wondering if there was anything I can do to really show that I am trying to be better? I don't want to use my ADHD as an excuse.
