I was planning on making this homemade ham and bean soup that I love to make after we’ve had a bone-in ham, since I can make my own broth and all that’s in it is ham, broth, beans, and onion. I realized I didn’t have any onion and was dreading having to run out to get one. My sweet partner offered to go to the store to get it, and I was so happy and touched that he would go out of his way. He was on his way out the door, asked me if I needed him to grab anything else. I asked him to pick up litter trays from the pet store as well, and he was like “okay! Let me know if there’s anything else!”  He left. A while later he returned, litter trays in hand, a bag with coffee creamer... and no onion. He felt so bad for forgetting but I couldn’t help but laugh. He came back without the one thing he went out for specifically. I told him it wasn’t a big deal and we had a giggle over it, no harm done. But it just felt like such a classic ADHD moment.   What little mishaps have you and your partner encountered?

The diagnosis has explained a lot about his ‘quirks’, but we’re struggling a fair bit with navigating the difficulties that ADHD symptoms can bring to a relationship. I recently found The Couples Guide to Thriving with ADHD by Melissa Orlov and Nancie Kohlenberger. Melissa’s husband has ADHD, and Nancie and her husband both have ADHD, and they talk a lot about what it’s like to be part of an ADHD effected relationship. They offer so much insight and a lot of different tactics for tackling ‘hot spots’.   I’ve felt SO seen and since I started reading this book and have started reading it aloud to my partner, pausing for discussions about how the subject matter relates to what we’re going through. It’s given me a lot of perspective and understanding I didn’t have previously and has  me realize what actions I have adopted to try to help things, that are actually harmful overall, like ‘parenting behavior’.   I really highly recommend it, it’s a fantastic resource.
