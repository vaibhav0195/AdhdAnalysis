d970d7a993b36ed50476b0dabadf893483113e09912309c3b0b99c04045090d4;;;My (DX PI) partner (NT) said to me today that he doesn’t think he should have to “just put aside all his anger and ignore everything I do wrong” for the rest of his life.;;;I have a few questions:  1. Is this really how it is for you guys? 2. If it isn’t, how do you cope?  And finally, maybe it’s an RSD thing, but I feel like I am nothing but a burden to my boyfriend and don’t understand why he loves me, so:  3. Why do you stay with your partners? 4. If you didn’t stay, why not? 5. If you didn’t stay, was life better when they left?  TIA :)
