I made a complaint online, and the owner responded within five minutes, saying he'd be talking to his pharmacists about it today. Thanks for encouraging me, and for listening!!!   Yes, you bitch, there is. I'm on it because, without it, I feel so emotionally out of control. Without it, I feel stressed and panicky because I am so extremely forgetful. I'm not a safe driver unmedicated. I don't remember how to do my job unmedicated. I can't function unmedicated.  How dare you comment on it. I'm trying so hard right now. My nana might be dying as we speak, my job involves so many people and so much thinking and organization and stress, my house is a travesty that I'm trying to undo, my boyfriend and I are fighting--and my puppy broke open my pill bottle with my last two pills in it, two days before my refill appointment (today). (Luckily, I did the math, and she had ingested FAR below the amount where it would do any harm to her. And I'm absolutely putting them in a locked cupboard now--she had never showed signs of interest in them before, and I hadn't realized she was gall enough to reach all the way to the back of the bathroom counter.)   I am trying so hard. Fuck you for making that comment. I don't care if you didn't realize I was still in the pharmacy when you said it (I had stopped to look at toothpaste while waiting for them to get my pills ready). I cried for five minutes in the parking lot because of you. I'm hurt and angry and I hate that I'm angry. I hate that I feel this way. I need to not let shit like that get to me, but it does and I can't control it.   I'm so, so glad I'm starting therapy next week.  Thank you for listening to me rant. Love you guys.
