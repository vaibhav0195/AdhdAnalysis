Adhd for me isn't a super power. Especially when I went undiagnosed, it has ruined my life, everything was ruined because of all the symptoms I have that went unnoticed. It made me not being able to pay attention in class and to get assignments done on time, It left me not being able to go to university at the same time as everyone else despite really wanting to, it left me not being able to keep a job for more than 1 or 5 months at a time, it left me not being able to clean my room despite having mold growing on food and dishes. It also left me impulsively buy things and only to forget about them the next day, or binge eating food until I want to vomit and binge drinking alcohol to the point where I could potentially die, all because I confuse my boredom for extreme sadness, anger issues so debilitating that it has ruined my relationship with my mother due to emotional dysregulation. It made me not being able to keep up with basic hygiene because I would lose time and I wouldn't realise a week has gone by. It made me buy new underwear and wear the same dirty  clothes because I found it too difficult to even pick up my dirty laundry and to throw them into the washing machine even though it's such a simple task.   Yeah I'm funny, outgoing and creative and I can learn easily especially when the task is hands on and I'm able to hyper focus under extreme pressure to the point where I can keep up with being timed on tasks at work. However these qualities are great and all, at the end of the day it doesn't feel like a super power and that it has caused depression and anxiety for me along with shame and self hate.
