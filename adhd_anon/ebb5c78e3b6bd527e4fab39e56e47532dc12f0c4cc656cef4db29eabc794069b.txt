ebb5c78e3b6bd527e4fab39e56e47532dc12f0c4cc656cef4db29eabc794069b;;;If it was REALLY important you would have remembered;;;I hate when people say that to me, “if it was really important you would have remembered” like ummm my brain basically does the opposite, like I remember unimportant things and forget all the important things lol.   Also, I always thought that that phrase was kind of a joke? Because you can’t choose whether or not you remember something right? But I guess it isn’t always a joke.. my S/O is basically the definition of “perfect executive function” so we have both had to learn how to adjust. I didn’t realize it actually made him upset if I forgot things, because he really thought that it must not have been important to me. He didn’t realize either that’s it’s not as easy as “just doing it” or “just remembering” things. That’s so crazy to me, it’s been a learning process for both of us haha.  Edit: omg thank you for the awards!! I wasn’t expecting this to get so much attention!! Im excited to read through all the comments :D
