c4cac7f417434c5097f26ef881e66585f1ace0a0eb2b01285eae6f03c2c9e489;;;ADHD for me is being overwhelmed with adulting 24/7 yet being bored and understimulated at the same time;;;Its crazy. I feel so overwhelmed with my responsibilities (you know, the ones everyone has...) yet i can not for the life of me stay interested in anything for longer than a few hours before getting bored and fidgety/daydreamy.   When people then ask me why im overwhelmed and if theres anything they can help me with, i sit back and think about it and realize my life isnâ€™t that busy but hey i still feel burned out for no reason whatsoever lmao fuck i need to go do some work now
