We'd easily be able to avoid the soul-crushing ennui and existential dread! We'd never get too hung up on the past. We'd always have a new obsession to keep us interested in life. We'd finally have time to get into all those hobbies we bought stuff for. We'd live long enough to come full circle on everything we started and ACTUALLY COMPLETE THINGS. (No promises regarding laundry tho)
