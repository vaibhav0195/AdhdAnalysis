I thought I had ADHD for a long time but i actually have had undiagnosed celiacs disease. Now that my executive function is returning, I can see how hard you all have it. My brain WAS NOT the same as a normal brain, and if you felt anything like me then your probably working harder than anyone else on the planet to keep up. I cannot explain to you guys the difference. Granted there were different causes, but I experienced many of the same side effects, forgetfulness, brain fog, emotional dysregulation, difficulty completing tasks and horrible diarrhea (kidding, that's just me). It was just so hard you guys. It was so so so hard. I have never understood why I have failed to thrive. Mornings were always hard, no routine, difficulty waking up, difficulty with motivation and now all of that is gone. I just cant express how sad I am for everyone who is ever told that they are lazy or unmotivated. FUCK THAT NOISE! I seriously couldnt have been trying harder and the pressure from my parents wrecked my self esteem. Things are just so much easier now. I just gradually stopped relying on my alarms, I stopped having to write things down, I stopped having to use GPS to get everywhere it's just so much better. I wish it was as easy of a fix for all of you as eating bread. I dont mean to brag about feeling better, but I'm just crying today over how fucking invalidated I've felt my whole life for not having any executive function. I cant even imagine what you all go through.  Either way, just know I know how hard you guys are working. This is probably one of the hardest working groups of people on the planet.  Edit: Thank you to everyone who congratulated me and shared their stories. I love this sub and I love how accepting everyone is.
