e3777673bfa72f0e75fc0f6cf6d9a7228d83e95db48cffd815dc9fc31a94d251;;;accidentally made my therapist cry yesterday lads;;;i was talking to my therapist about how i was going to set up an appointment to hopefully get rediagnosed (i was diagnosed as a child but that was quite a while ago) with ADHD and get on medication. the executive dysfunction and focus issues have really been holding me back and it feels like it's only been getting worse.  and i told her, "sometimes i get so excited because i can so clearly imagine the kind of person i could be if i had medication to help me. it's like i'm stuck inside."  and she said, "yeah." (like in understanding) but her voice was shaky and when i looked up she had tears in her eyes. she recovered very quickly and continued on with the conversation, but i was surprised to see her react in that way.  it was a really small thing, but for some reason it's made me... more determined to tackle this thing? like, my therapist has always been a very empathetic person but right then i felt especially seen and validated. like i really deserved to do whatever it takes to lead a better life.  **edit:** to the people who are completely and utterly losing their minds in the comment section because my therapist teared up at something i had to say for a few seconds... uhhh, don't. you are making a mountain out of a molehill and the world isn't going to come to an end because my therapist dropped the illusion of being emotionless that you cherish so deeply for a few seconds.  i did not think my therapist emotionally connecting to me was a bad thing and my life didn't come to a catastrophic end when it happened. i thought it was positive, and it made me feel more confident about sharing my experiences and thoughts with her. i appreciate the armchair psychology, though! <3  **edit again:** wow, i did not expect this post to take off in any way, but thank you all for your comments, thoughts and kind words! it means a lot!  **edit again again:** W O W HOLY STINK, SILVER AND GOLD. WOW WOW WOW. thank you so much u/dangnguyenofficial for the gold! i dunno what to say!
