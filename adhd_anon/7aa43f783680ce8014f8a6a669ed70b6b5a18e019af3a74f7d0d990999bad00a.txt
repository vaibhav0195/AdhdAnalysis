Recently I went through a horrible depressive episode and wasnt acting "hyper" and my friends had told me they didn't think I was acting like I had ADHD.  It was hard to hear that. I mean are you supposed to be hyper and jumping around all the time, especially if your going through a depressive episode. No a lot of us struggle with adult/teen ADHD and still act hyper but we dont act hyper all the time.  Trust me I know that we can look erratic at times explaining a hyperfixation or ranting on a random subject, or our brains can be going a mile a minute and that most of the time is very visible.  But you dont need to act hyper to have ADHD, especially if you struggle with depression which can often go hand in hand with ADHD.  Anyways I hope everyone on this subreddit knows that they are valid even when not acting "hyper. Thank you for being an awesome community.
