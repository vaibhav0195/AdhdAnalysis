c8df570f0f4d1ce470e7cd4622c8e60318df712b1a3092ce793da05e9893b478;;;My teacher slipped an extra 10% to my exam's grade;;;Due to the quarantine, today's final exam had to be moved online and the format was changed to a multiple choice test with a very strict 30 min time limit (after that time the test would close automatically and submit itself). The thing is that this subject's teacher is also my academical advisor and he knows about my situation and my ADHD diagnosis (which was kinda recent). I still don't have my accommodations so I do every test and assignment like everyone else.  So a few hours after finishing the test, he uploads the grades and I notice that he added an extra +10% to my grade, to make up for the strict timing of the test. He TOTALLY didn't have to do this because I'm still in the process of asking for accommodations and my grade was more than enough to pass the class, BUT HE DID IT ANYWAYS AND IT WAS A SUCH NICE THING TO DO :'((((
