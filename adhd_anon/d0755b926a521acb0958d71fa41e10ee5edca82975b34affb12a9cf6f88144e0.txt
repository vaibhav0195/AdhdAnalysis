If you haven't heard of Dr. Russell Barkley, do yourself a favor and give his work a read/listen.;;;I have spent the majority of my life struggling, learning, and adapting to deficits in executive functioning. Most of the time, it was struggling to realize that the way that I am is not a disadvantage. I was given a diagnosis of ADHD at a young age, however was withheld medication until my early university years.  I could give you my life story, how/when I realized I needed help... however, there's plenty of that in this subreddit, and let's be real. No one here has the attention span to sit through a long-winded post. See what I did there?  Dr. Russell Barkley is a clinical professor of psychiatry out of VCU Medical School. He's been involved in research & a psychiatrist since the early '70s. Most of his work revolves around ADHD and related fields spanning into childhood years. He's written 27 books on these topics, and has published nearly 300 peer reviewed, scholarly research articles.  His work helped change my perspective, and I hope it can help even a single person here.  I've attached an incredibly abridged video presentation of some of his work in an attempt to get some of you to do more digging into his, and other's, research. He's devoted his life work to us. Please give yourself the pleasure of listening to him.    [Dr. Russell Barkley - ADHD](https://youtu.be/_tpB-B8BXk0)  Edit: I've gotten a few DMs, and I'm glad people are enjoying this. I read through this sub daily & see a lot of people posting about how happy they are to complete their goal for the day, and that is amazing! I'm very happy for all of you taking steps in the right direction.... I just want to help you bridge the gap to longer term tasks and goals.
