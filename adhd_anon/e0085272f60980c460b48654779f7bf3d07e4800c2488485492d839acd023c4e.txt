The emotional aspect of ADHD need to be studied further because from research and personal experience, I have found that it is one of the greater parts to ADHD. Emotional dysregulation, impulsively, anger issues, frustration, intense emotions have all been constantly found amongst those with ADHD. If we want to further our support, and improve our understanding of this condition, we must increase our research in this field.
