Before you try this, note how the boundary line between different activities is not really a line at all. Normally when we have decided we are "doing" some new task, actually we are still in the process of moving towards the actual action, or are focused on it mentally.   So, when you can't get your ass off the couch to do the chore, just stop whatever you may be doing and close your eyes for a moment. Feel your surroundings for a moment, in a sort of mindful way. Notice that because starting a task is basically an abstraction, and won't change anything in the external environment at first, having begun the task will actually feel just as relaxing and easy as what you are doing now, except your immediate goals will have changed somewhat.   Now, since "actually being started" on the thing is just a convenient abstraction, tell yourself that you actually are already in the process of doing this task. Rather than going through some mental event of "getting started", simply recategorize the current moment from "before beginning" to "after beginning".  If we think of the aversion to getting started on something as a sort of mental barrier, then for me this trick doesn't spend energy breaking through the wall like kool aid man. That takes a lot of mental energy. Rather, it's more like closing your eyes on one side of the intact wall, and opening them to find you are on the other side of the wall.   **EDIT TLDR**  What seems to be the main part about this that helps me is realizing that in the the moments instantaneously before you "begin" and instantaneously  after you "begin", your body and your surroundings feel basically the same. This is not really a complete summary of what's above, but one of the more important parts.
