e5b5f0d3274e8f1db969d926ea292b0365221b0ce461ecb678160d21c60bc3e5;;;Tired of my mind treating simple tasks as tragedies to overcome;;;Washing face, changing before bed, doing laundry.. i have to give myself a pep talk every time I have to do something. It’s absurd.   Also, I’m trying to do an online course now during quarantine, so it requires some academic reading. I love the subject and it’s great not to have to go out and meet people. It’s a little easier to focus this way (i could never even start one without the quarantine). But every book chapter and every article takes hours and hours. I get distracted all the time and have to read each paragraph over and over again like an idiot. It’s like I’m back in school again, homework was such a nightmare that would take hours of mainly spacing out.   I’m 25 with an art degree and wish to pursue a science degree next, which is why I’m taking the online course. But if this is how it will be there’s no way I’ll manage it.    EDIT: what an overwhelming response, guys, thank you for this. It’s very encouraging to read some of your stories of success and continuous struggle. So much good and diverse advice that I already started trying to implement to see what works for me. I’m wishing you all to achieve your goals. Love Reddit.
