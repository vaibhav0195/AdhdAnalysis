He then convinced me that I should go be evaluated and low and behold I was diagnosed after 31 years.   Looking back there were so many signs and even a few teachers tried to convince my parents that I needed to be evaluated at a young age. They always claimed that they were just trying to drug me and Iâ€™ve believed it my entire life.
