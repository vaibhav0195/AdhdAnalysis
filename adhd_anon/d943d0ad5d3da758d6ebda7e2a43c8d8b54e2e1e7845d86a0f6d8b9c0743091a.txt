Anything goes as long as it works, right?  I'll start:  1. Playing music in the shower (or any activity) to keep track of time (coz ya gotta rinse by the second chorus ya know) 2. Bringing a permanent marker everywhere and writing reminders on my wrist but I use a secret alphabet that makes it look much cooler. 3. Putting very important reminders on the main door's doornob (100% foolproof) so I don't forget to refill my water bottle or something similar
