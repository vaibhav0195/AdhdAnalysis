Maybe take a minute a learn something before condescending to someone about their own disorder.  You are correct!  I don't bounce off the walls or talk a mile a minute.  The people who exhibit those symptoms are not more or less severely affected than me, and if you'd taken five minutes to read about it in the two years since I was diagnosed you'd know that.  Edit:  For clarification, what pissed me off was being dismissed as "just" having ADD, not that they're behind on the current DSM.  Because I don't fit their picture of what ADHD looks like, I don't have it "as bad".
