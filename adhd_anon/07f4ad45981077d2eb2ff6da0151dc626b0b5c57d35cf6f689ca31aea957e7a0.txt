This was only my 3rd time seeing him, but I love him. Anyways, he was asking me questions about my new meds. He was kinda disappointed after I told him I didn't feel different in any way considering I'm taking 20mg (I have been for a month) He started asking me questions (or at least he was trying to as I rambled on about the anatomy of a dragon) about how I read social cues and stuff like that. Simple answer: I don't. I just keep talking on and on until someone snaps me out of it. He also noticed I struggle with making eye contact during a conversation and how large my vocabulary is and how intelligent I am (according to him). I heard him talking to my mom as I casually sketched in my sketchbook, and I heard him talking about how I may have Asperger's along with my ADHD. So yeah. That's a thing that happened.  Edit: Clearly, you all care way more than I thought you would lol. I would change the title, but it won't let me, so we are just going to pretend the "I know none of you care" bit isn't there. :)
