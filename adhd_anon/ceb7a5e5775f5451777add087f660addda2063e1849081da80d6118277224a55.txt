I survived the pandemic and found a way to study less with store only highlights of every course. Best part is, we didn't even have the online studying thing cuz my country is dead poor in regards to that level of innovation. 4 months of staying at home procrastinating till the week just before exams and yet I have triumphed. THIS IS HUGE YALL!!!    EDIT : OMG GUYS THANK YOU A MILLION TIMES FOR THE AWARDS AND THE LOVELY COMMENTS. I LOVE YOU GUYS VERY MUCH AND LOVE ALL THIS COMMUNITY ❤️❤️
