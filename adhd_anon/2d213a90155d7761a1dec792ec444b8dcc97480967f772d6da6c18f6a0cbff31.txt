Step 3: Hold yourself to the conventional standards of society.  Step 4: Believe everyone's ridiculous moralising when they say you are not living up to your potential, you are lazy, you just need to try harder, focus and apply yourself.  Step 5: Keep trying, as hard as you can, and still not reaching the unattainable standards set by society, and in turn, yourself.  Step 6: Never tell anyone about the issues with motivation, memory or organisation. They are moral failings, not cognitive disorders. Only disclose anxiety and depression, because everyone knows they are real problems.  Step 7: Don't find out about ADHD. Knowledge is power, and you can't work on a project if you don't know how the subject matter operates.    It's been a long road, but thank fuck I've stopped making everything a moral issue. I'm very logical really, so I don't know where I got that from, other than society constantly drumming it into me for 30 odd years...
