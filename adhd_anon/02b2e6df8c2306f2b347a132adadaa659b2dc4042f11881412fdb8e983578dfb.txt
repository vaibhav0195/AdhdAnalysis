Thank you Reddit!;;;After more than a year of thinking "I need help" I finally **picked up the phone and called my GP** (I'm in the UK). They gave me an appointment for next week in which I'll ask to be referred to a psychiatrist.  **How did I do it**? I imagined myself doing it and concentrated very hard on the sensation I'd get once I do it.  And now I have that sensation, it's amazing! I can't wait to start this path and release my potential!  Thank you, People of Reddit, for showing me I'm not alone and **it's ok not to be normal**. Your experiences and advice have been essential in my decision to ask a professional for help.  &#x200B;  edit: I am reading some comments about how long it takes to **get a diagnosis in the UK**. Many people recommend using [Right to Choose](https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/choice-in-mental-health-care-v2.pdf) (thanks u/London_Dachshund) and ask to be referred to services like [Psychiatry-UK](https://www.psychiatry-uk.com/adhd/). It cuts down the waiting from months to a few weeks!
