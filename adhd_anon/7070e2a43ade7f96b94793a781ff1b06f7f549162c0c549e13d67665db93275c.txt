7070e2a43ade7f96b94793a781ff1b06f7f549162c0c549e13d67665db93275c;;;the “everyone feels like that” response to adhd symptoms feels invalidating;;;i’m particularly tired this week. i don’t know why i feel like this happens very often about ADHD problems (more than other MH issues) but the amount of times i’ve tried to explain an adhd problem to a friend and have been met with the “everyone feels that way” comment is invalidating and frankly infuriating.  i don’t expect everyone to understand what goes on in my head especially because i can’t imagine what it could possibly be like in the head of another person who doesn’t have these issues but can’t people take a step back from coopting every mental illness symptom as “relatable content?” I know i’m not the only person with adhd or mental illness and i know it goes undiagnosed in a lot of people but it really seems like the general population doesn’t understand the difference between experiencing a feeling occasionally and experiencing it to the point that it becomes debilitating and interferes with quality of life.  when people keep reacting to the mental health specific feelings i express to them, it really makes me wonder if i’m delusional and no different from the average person, that my struggles are made up, etc. again i don’t know what it’s like to live in someone else’s brain, so all i know is my own so i have nothing to compare to.  &#x200B;  >**edit-** it looks like a lot of people think my ADHD complaint to my friends was about being tired which is funny because i didn’t intend for it to read that way. I *am* tired in general yes, but when i said that originally, i meant i’m tired of the dismissive responses i’ve been receiving. the original adhd complaint i received the “everyone feels that way” response to was that i was trying to describe that feeling when your brain gets really overwhelmed with info that it just kind of stalls and you get stuck and can’t move forward with tasks.  &#x200B;
