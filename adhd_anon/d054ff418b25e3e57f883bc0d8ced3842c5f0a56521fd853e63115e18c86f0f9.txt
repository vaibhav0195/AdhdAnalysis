d054ff418b25e3e57f883bc0d8ced3842c5f0a56521fd853e63115e18c86f0f9;;;I don’t know if this was wrong of me but it worked;;;So my boyfriend has adhd and I know he struggles with cleaning his room, so we was on the phone one day and I told him babe do you trust me. He started nervous laughing and said yes.  I told him okay do as I say okay, I told him to put me on loud speaker and put his phone on his desk and make sure he can hear me.   He said okay he was so confused.  Then I said okay now I want you to pick up all the dishes and cups in your room and bring them down stairs he started laughing and actually did it.  Then I said now make your bed it doesn’t have to be neat but just make it. He did it too.   Then I said now put all your dirty clothes in your laundry basket, but instead he did one better and put them in the washer! Longish story short I helped him clean his room with no distractions because I know when he has his phone in his hand he will be distracted and start looking at other things.   He manage to clean his room, do his laundry and now he’s happy. We’re in a long distance relationship so it the best I can do to help and I guess it really did work as he got it done and now calls me whenever he feels like he needs to clean his room 😂🤟🏽
