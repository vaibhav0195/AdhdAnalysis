cc09c57a08d3f47f7deffc1c40aa947db6a4f795f7a7559ca7713bcb0228a780;;;Everyone talks about the hyper days and how our brain runs at 100miles an hour with 50 tabs open. But why does nobody talk about the days where our brain can't even open one tab?;;;People tend to focuse on our hyperactivity, but nobody tells you about the days where we can't focuse on anything.  The days where I can't even get out of bed because my brain can't focuse on getting my blanket off or standing up. Where I can't muster up the dopamine to just brush my theeth or do any kind of work.  Where I just can't seem to feel anything, especially not happiness. And everything just seems tedious and like hard work.  It feels like my brain blows all it's energy in one day leading me to hyper af and unable to concentrate, but other days the energy is just gone.  We need more info on that part of ADHD
