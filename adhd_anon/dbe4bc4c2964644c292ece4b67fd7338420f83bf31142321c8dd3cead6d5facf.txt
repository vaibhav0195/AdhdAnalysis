Thatâ€™s the post.  Update: I did 8 pages and turned it in. Iâ€™ve also crocheted 2 cat hats.  It was a good day I would share pics but I donâ€™t know how to on here ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬  Update 2: HE EXTENDED THE DEADLINE 12 HOURS UGH  Another update: if anyone wants me to crochet them the cat beanie and is willing to pay shipping then Iâ€™ll most definitely do it, tips would be greatly appreciated but Iâ€™d do it just to make someoneâ€™s day! Just message me and we can talk about it for sure!!
