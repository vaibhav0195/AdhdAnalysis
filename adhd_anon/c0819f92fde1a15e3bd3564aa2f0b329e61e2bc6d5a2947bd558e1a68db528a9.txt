I felt like I could have been more social and grown more as a person but I was hindered by something I didn't understand.  I felt like I went through so much growth as an individual and came to know myself and my ADHD all throughout my 20's.  Everything before that feels like a blur; wasted potential.  This is coming from someone who was diagnosed early and medicated. I just never realized how much ADHD affected my life until recently.  Is this a common feeling with ADHD?  EDIT: Wow! This really blew up! It seems this really resonates with everyone. I'll try to read as many as I can but I can't promise I can reply to everything (though I may read a few messages between work).  Thank you, and stay strong everyone!
