When hearing about adderall from everyone else, it’s easy to put it on a pedestal, and become easily reliant and attached to the medication as if it’s going to turn you into a superhero. Sad news is, it doesn’t. While it certainly helps(!), it’s not a miracle drug. It doesn’t write your schedule, it doesn’t go to the grocery store for you, and it definitely doesn’t do your laundry (sadly). It’s very easy to take it, and waste the whole day doing “more important tasks” like grinding Valorant and Overwatch. You’re still you, and you still have ADHD. The other half of the equation to treatment is discipline and practice. I’ve been expecting that after taking adderall, that I would magically just become Mr. Business Man and start planning everything weeks ahead, be able to get all my chores done, and etc., you get the point. I guess what I’m trying to say, is that adderall isn’t the end all be all. And to rely on a medication to do that for you is a recipe for substance abuse. Adderall helps, it really does. But you have to be willing to use that help in a positive manner :)
