I want to expand on [my reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/c3ee48/the_single_most_important_thing_you_can_do_for/erqsiyu/).  &#x200B;  (Edited as I think of things to add)  # Before we dive in:  * **This might get uncomfortable.** I'm unpacking some deep stuff here. If you're in a really sad place, I suggest coming back when you feel better <3 * **All of this comes from my experience.** That means that I'm painfully aware of how this feels. It also means this might not describe you and your experience. * **I share this to help people suffer less.** If we understand what's going on, we gain power to change it. But understanding these things sometimes hurts too. I'm with you, we're in this together!  # So what about ADHD makes relationships especially hard?  **tl;dr: ADHD cripples the part of our brain responsible for social interaction.**  1. ADHD cripples a part of our brain called the prefrontal cortex (also called the frontal lobe). 2. To quote [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefrontal_cortex): "This brain region has been implicated in planning complex cognitive behavior, personality expression, decision making, and moderating social behavior." \[[source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2784035)\]  # But what does this look like in practice?  **Social incompetence fuels shame, abandonment issues, and codependent tendencies.**  * Growing up, I didn't understand when I said or did something insensitive. This sent my peers strong signals that I am an unsafe person, so they backed off. * This confused me, because nobody told me what I did. I began to feel ashamed of myself. * This also fueled fear of abandonment, which set me up for codependent tendencies: the few people who didn't run away, I latched on to and smothered. Eventually they left too, compounding abandonment issues. * I suspect this is why RSD and ADHD often come together.  **Inattention sends the message that we don't care.**  * My ADHD-PI meant things like eye contact and thoughtful listening came very difficult. People understandably received this as I'm uninterested and don't care about what they're saying. * I would frequently interrupt people mid-sentence because I couldn't wait long enough for a break in the conversation to say what I wanted. * I didn't understand the rhythm of conversation, and I couldn't remember what I wanted to say long enough to wait for an appropriate time. This feels insulting to the other person, who then withdraws. * The "common sense" people talk about — a lot of that boils down to instinctive observations that the frontal lobe handles. So without it, we miss out on all those subtle cues: body language, tone, word choice, facial expressions.  **With ADHD, it's easier to misunderstand people, and for them to misunderstand us.**  * Largely due to our crippled frontal lobe, it's hard to identify exactly what we are trying to say, and what others are saying to us. * Relationships are built on clear, consistent communication. * Simple example:    * Wife: Looks like we're out of milk.    * Me: I'm headed to the store today. \[forgets to pick up milk\]    * Wife: Did you get the milk?    * Me: \[ashamed\] no, I never said I would pick up the milk. \[technically true!\]    * Wife: Yes you did! (sigh) \[she reasonably inferred from my first reply that I would pick up the milk, even though I never said it directly\]    * \[argument ensues\] * Another example: My wife and I start talking about what we're going to do this evening. We discuss several options, their pros/cons, and how things might work out. In all the conversation, we never actually, conclusively settle on what we're doing, and each of us walk away thinking we agreed to a different plan. That evening does not go well.  **Disorganized, impulsive, and unhygienic people seem unsafe.**  * Of course, they don't know we're that way because of a neurological condition. But it triggers the same instinctual avoidance. * The worst part: it's understandable. I wouldn't want to hang out with the 8-year-old me, who brushed his teeth once a week and rarely washed his hands after using the restroom. * Our impulsiveness may seem dangerous to others, so we might get labeled as "bad kids" early on.  **Flaking out breaks trust and puts people off.**  * Again, understandable. If I'm late to the third date in a row, she might reasonably assume I don't really like her. * Worst of all, it breaks my trust in myself. If I can't trust myself, I can't trust anyone else, and relationships are built on trust.  **We can't process conversations in real-time, so we look awkward.**  * Since the part of our brain responsible for social interaction is crippled, we compensate with other parts of our brain that aren't as well-adapted to the role. This means we *can do it, just not as fast as everyone else.* * This means we often can't say what we really mean, or pause awkwardly, or suddenly lose our train of thought. * This often leads to public shame and bullying, worsening our fear of social interactions.  **We can't muster the patience and energy to maintain social norms, so we seem careless or cold.**  * We have a hard time with anything that takes focus, but doesn't produce short-term reward. Many social norms fall into this category. * For example, my grandparents frequently reminded me how much they would have appreciated a thank-you card for the countless Christmas/Birthday checks they mailed me. * People like kind surprises, gifts, notes, etc. All of this takes executive planning that we often lack.  **Social success depends on the ability to plan ahead, which we can't.**  * Most functional people need to plan things out ahead of time. But if we can't keep a schedule, we effectively exclude ourselves from these gatherings. * If we do attend them, we may arrive unprepared, fueling embarrassment.  **We may come across easily frustrated because we can't focus.**  * I didn't realize until I started treatment that I become angry when I'm overwhelmed with stimulus. * Inability to filter out noise is just another way of saying inability to focus. * When I can't focus, I get angry, which sends the wrong message to whoever I'm talking to.  **We usually come across as mostly normal, so people don't treat us with the same compassion they would if we had other handicaps.**  * Down's syndrome, Parkinson's, and other handicaps send clear signals to others that often provokes a compassionate response. * People with ADHD, however, appear normal enough, so we don't trigger that same compassion. They assume we should be able to plan, focus, and wait, so when we don't, we incur their judgment. And our own.  **Dealing with ADHD takes time and focus off developing our own identity.**  * Ever hung out with someone who just goes along with what everyone else wants? Who never has an original idea or opinion or interest? Not very fun to be around. That was me. * Healthy relationships take healthy people. Healthy people have developed their sense of preferences, likes, dislikes, hobbies, etc. These become the common bonds that hold people together. * For many reasons, we often don't ever have the time and space to develop these things. We never truly become a person. And it takes people to form relationships. * Developing identity takes time, money, energy, planning, focus, and support — all of which we frequently lack due to ADHD's effect on our whole family system growing up. * For example: If I can learn guitar, I build self-confidence, and a skill that builds bridges into relationships. I can start or join a band, play for family, release stress, and boost my attractiveness to a mate. But learning guitar takes focus, attention, and dedication that ADHD robs me of.  **Not understanding why all this happens, or what to do about it, compounds into shame.**  * When people encounter this kind of behavior, they often don't know what to say or do, other than back off. * This means we lack critical insight into what's causing these suddenly-gone relationships. * This means we feel powerless to improve things. * This means we lose hope, and accept the idea we are broken in some unknown, un-fixable way (another way of saying: shame).  **Shame devastates self-esteem.**  * Self-esteem is the basis for how we treat others. * If I can't trust myself, and nitpick everything I do, I'm going to have a really hard time trusting and not nitpicking others. * If I can't trust and constantly nitpick others, nobody will want to hang out with me. * Without self-esteem I retreat into all kinds of coping behavior that further isolates me:    * I might become hyper-critical of everyone around me as a way of drawing attention off my failures    * I might become codependent, desperate for validation and approval from others    * I might numb out into drug abuse, or other compulsive behavior like overeating, spending, gambling, risky sex, etc.  # So what can we do about it?  This is my approach so far.  1. **Get diagnosed and build a good treatment plan with help from a professional.** Everything depends on this. It will take more time and effort than we all prefer, but nothing happens until this does. 2. **Drown yourself in the facts about ADHD**. This helped stop the shame cycle more than anything for me. You're not broken in some un-fixable way. Your'e not a worthless incompetent loser. You suffer from a neurochemical imbalance that has decades of research and scientific backing. I found audiobooks therapeutic. Ned Hallowell's books gave me encouragement early on. 3. **Work on showing yourself kindness every day.** Maybe that's too much at first—start by trying not to actively berate yourself. Point out whatever you see yourself doing well, and make a big deal about it. End your day with journaling or private reflection on the day's successes. Think small: I didn't overreact to that stressful situation as bad as I did last time. I didn't procrastinate paying my bills quite as long this month compared to last month. I spent 3 hours mindlessly online instead of 5. I made that one phone call I needed to. 4. **Surround yourself with supportive people**. Find a therapist, friend, pastor, CHADD group, or online community that understands your struggle and offers encouragement. Sometimes borrowed self-esteem is what we need until we can fuel self-esteem on our own. 5. **In safe relationships, let them know what's going on.** For the people who would understand, you can tell them something like "hey, I want you to know my ADHD sometimes sends the wrong messages. If I come across as uninterested, distant, or angry, will you let me know?" 6. **Celebrate victories.** So you remembered your nephew's birthday in time to get him a present? Get yourself a present too! Call your support circle and celebrate with them. It's a big deal, even though it may seem laughably small. It's not. 7. **Write letters or emails**. This slows down the social interaction to a pace that we can work better at. It's not a total substitute for face-to-face connections, but it can help smooth things over and keep the relationship on an even keel.  &#x200B;  Wishing you all the very best!  \-Austin  &#x200B;  **P.S.:** I hereby release this post into the public domain worldwide.
