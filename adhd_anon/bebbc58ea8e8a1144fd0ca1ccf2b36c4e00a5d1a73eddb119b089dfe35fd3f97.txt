bebbc58ea8e8a1144fd0ca1ccf2b36c4e00a5d1a73eddb119b089dfe35fd3f97;;;Finally diagnosed, apparently im not a lazy failure and i cleaned my room and;;;24 years of living under the "spacey, lazy, but very smart. what a shame" label, i finally realized something was wrong beyond just lazy after spending two years trying to get my life in order and trying to develop my skillset and failing miserably.  i finally went to a therapist, who diagnosed me with adhd-i. ive started medication and today i cleaned my room. a two day ordeal took me two hours, i put everything where it actually belongs and not just stashed out of sight. i didn't get antsy or distracted at all, i didnt even realize id been going for two hours until i was done. it sent my family into shock.  when i was done i cried. i cried so so much, i was overwhelmed with joy and relief, the simplest tasks had always been a struggle, but today i just did it. and i did it well.  EDIT: i made this post just bc i wanted to share that tiny moment of victory with someone, i didnt expect to be so overwhelmed with support :") the post is literally getting out of hand and i cant keep up but thank you all so so much for your positive support and sharing your experiences as well, i have never felt so not-alone in my entire life
