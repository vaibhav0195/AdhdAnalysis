It's real, and it sucks.  One thing I've noticed lately, though, is how sometimes, you can get away with paying a smaller ADHD tax if you plan ahead when you buy things.  Hear me out.  1. I could buy a whole crown of fresh broccoli for like, $1.50, but I won't get around to washing, cutting, and preparing it.  A $2.50 bag of pre-cut, pre-washed broccoli will get eaten.  Instead of a $1.50 ADHD tax for broccoli I won't eat, it's a $1.00 tax for broccoli I will eat. 2. A cute planner or notebook with a great layout is worth $30 if I will actually use it.  An awkward-to-use planner that I'm not motivated to ever touch is useless, and not worth spending even $5 on. 3. With vitamins, if they're not gummies, I won't maintain the habit of taking them.  I'll pay extra for the gummy vites that I will use versus the regular ones I will waste.  Other things include: paying for Spotify Premium because I know that ads (or going to find music elsewhere) will distract me.  Only buying clothes from stores with really long return windows, even if it's pricier (REI lets you return things for a full year, bro).  Paying more for a phone with a really long battery life so it's not dead half the time.   As someone who was raised to be frugal, a lot of this stuff feels kinda shameful almost?  But when I stop and think about it, I stand by my assessment that it's actually cheaper this way.  Edit: thank you!  but please don't spend money on awards.  spend it on pre-washed, fresh cut broccoli, pals  Edit 2: Y'all make some great points.  The encouragement and understanding in the comments is making my whole week.  After some further reflection, some things really stand out to me:  1.  Viewing willpower and energy as limited resources is critical.  Purchases are cost + willpower + energy.  Whole, unwashed broccoli is lower on cost but higher on willpower and energy demands.    -> I feel like we can punish ourselves for wasting time.  Like I convinced myself "don't buy pre-prepped veggies if you're gonna waste 8 hrs on video games, you can spare the time."  But that's basically punishing myself for having ADHD by depriving myself of vegetables I'd actually eat.    -> Besides, maybe the 20 mins I save by having pre-prepped broccoli means I have enough mental energy to wash some dishes after I eat, which means washing dishes on Saturday takes 40 minutes instead of an hour, which means I have enough energy to clean my room, and so on.    2.  Frozen vegetables & fruit, meal kits, and bulk purchases help.  I will also add: did you know you can freeze bread??  Then toast it and it's good!  3.  Point of caution: spending more on something doesn't necessarily mean it's more likely to be used.  We have all been there.  But if something will genuinely be more usable or more functional at a higher cost, it might be really worth it.

I also plan to try to apply some of this stuff to my own life, although there's obviously not enough info here to do therapy on yourself (and I wouldn't recommend it).  The presenter was Dr. Mary Solanto, and the manual she published can be found [here](https://www.guilford.com/books/Cognitive-Behavioral-Therapy-for-Adult-ADHD/Mary-Solanto/9781462509638) (not sponsored lol).  I'm not endorsing it or suggesting you buy it, just wanted to be transparent with where I'm getting all of this :)  The speaker described a cognitive-behavioral group therapy treatment for ADHD.  It's designed to take place over 12 sessions of 2 hours each, for a group of 6-10 people with ADHD.  The treatment's not a good fit for everyone (people with more severe disorders on top of ADHD might need to have those treated first, for instance) but it's been adapted for use with college students, veterans, etc.  It seemed pretty effective based on randomized control trials, and it also sounded like stuff that would be personally helpful for me.  Below, I'll describe some of the features of the treatment that might be helpful to know.    **Treatment goals:**  Improving "TOP" skills-- Time management, Organization, and Planning.  The rationale for focusing on these skills was that deficits in these areas are possibly the most universal feature of ADHD.  And being bad at those really sucks lol.  *(One side note is that the speaker described hyperfocus as "Difficulty switching from a task that's rewarding but less important to a task that's less rewarding but more important" which I think is an interesting way of looking at it.)*  **Treatment methods:**  * Teaching specific skills, like planner use and filing systems    * Part of the treatment involves regular use of a planner, which should be checked regularly.  I'm not sure if it's supposed to be 3 times a day or *at least* 3 times a day, but the speaker said something along those lines.    * You should have only 1 planner, it should be easy to enter tasks, and it should be easily portable * Teaching "rules," or helpful self-talk, to guide behaviors    * We tend to think about tasks in unhelpful ways, and correcting that can make us feel better and more capable and prepared. * Implementing self-reinforcement strategies that are contingent upon the completion of aversive or boring tasks    * We don't do boring or unpleasant things largely because they aren't rewarding enough, so using strategies that make those tasks feel more rewarding will help make it easier to get them started and finished.    * Pairing unpleasant and pleasant tasks together    * Using naturally occurring reinforcers * Practicing visualizing long-term rewards    * In ADHD, we view rewards that are farther in the future as being way less valuable than immediate rewards, which makes planning for the future and acting towards future goals really hard.      * Visualizing those long-term goals is thought to help us feel like those future rewards are more valuable in the present.  * Reducing demoralization, anxiety, and perfectionism    * Using traditional cognitive-behavioral strategies, like challenging negative thoughts.   * Practicing within sessions and at home    * Getting support from group members and positive reinforcement from therapists to keep people engaged and motivated.  **Features of treatment**  * Mantras (the "rules" mentioned earlier)    * Basically, reminders to tell yourself during the day to help you engage in more adaptive behaviors    * The mantras described were:       * "If it's not in the planner, it doesn't exist."       * "If I'm having trouble getting started, then the first step is too big."  (Can be applied iteratively, until there's a first step that's small enough.  I personally love this one.)       * "All things must be done in the order of their priority"       * "Getting started is the hardest part."  (It can take a lot of energy to get started, but after that, things tend to take less effort)       * "A place for everything and everything in its place" (for staying organized)       * "Out of sight, out of mind" (for controlling distractions) * Homework (they call it Home Experiences or something, but it's basically homework)    * Gets gradually more challenging over the sessions.    * An example of an early assignment is to choose one relatively easy task that you've been procrastinating on that'll take less than 1 hour, schedule when you'll do it, do it, and then provide yourself some reinforcement for doing it.    * When you do the homework, therapists will cheer you on and ask questions about how you did it.    * When you don't do the homework, they'll help you identify and address any obstacles to doing it, and help you figure out strategies to do it next time.  **My personal takeaways**  * Maybe I should try using a planner again lol * I might try the mantras and see if they help * Focusing on positive reinforcement for tasks sounds pretty helpful.  I might try to fine-tune how and when I reward/reinforce myself  &#x200B;  Hope this was educational for you all!  \--  It's not open to everyone so I can't invite y'all, but I want to share the insights.  Also, if there are any questions you have, I can try to get answers for you, but no guarantees the presenters will read or answer my questions.  (as a little background, I'm ADHD & also a clinical psych grad student, and the webinar is through a conference I'm virtually attending.)
