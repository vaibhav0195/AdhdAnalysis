Whether you're in class or online, if you turn it on during class, Word will live translate everything that's said into text. You can see it typing as its being spoken.   If you have issues with getting up frequently, opening tabs/browsing during lecture, fidgeting, or just zoning out only to come back and have no idea what was said, you can just refer to the notes Word is taking for you.   Its been an absolute game changer for me and makes class less stressful, so i thought some of you would appreciate it too.  Edit: thanks for the awards!! Happy Friday everyone!
