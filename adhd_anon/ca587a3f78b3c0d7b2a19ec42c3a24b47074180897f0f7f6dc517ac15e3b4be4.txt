ca587a3f78b3c0d7b2a19ec42c3a24b47074180897f0f7f6dc517ac15e3b4be4;;;Adhd and social anxiety is the worst combo;;;Does anyone find they can become two completely different people? When I’m confident I won’t shut up (I ask a lot of questions too and get bored easily unless someone's fun/funny). People find me funny. But when I’m anxious I’m so scared of what people think of me I shut down completely. Say dumb things. Brain freezes. I’m the quiet girl from pitch perfect. People exposure has to be constant to cure my SA- but maintaining interest in hobbies, routine, commitment.. getting myself to start a job application/turn up on time..it’s so freakin hard. Ironically i despise being alone. Love talking to people when im not anxious but it takes A LOT to get me there.  tldr- either the loudest or quietest person in the room. Constant exposure cures SA but difficult with lack of discipline/low threshold for boredom. Advice appreciated.  update: I'm shook from the reaction I've gotten. I've questioned my adhd diagnosis a lot- if i'm just making an excuse for my laziness. But this makes me feel more at peace now.
