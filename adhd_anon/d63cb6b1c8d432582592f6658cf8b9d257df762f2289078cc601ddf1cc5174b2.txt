d63cb6b1c8d432582592f6658cf8b9d257df762f2289078cc601ddf1cc5174b2;;;The psychiatrist said gifted children don't have ADHD;;;She was my last chance. The health insurance covered the costs, and I can't afford a regular private psychiatrist.   She asked what my GPA was. I told her. I mentioned I used to be called "gifted". I told her about all my symptoms and difficulties since I was a child.  She said gifted children don't have ADHD. She said no ADHD person can be an engineering student. She said that "now people hear those things from the USA and they think they know what they're talking about". She said she wouldn't change her mind. She asked who was the first person to consider the possibility. I answered "myself". She replied "yeah, I figured", to which I said "but three psychiatrists have confirmed it". She said they must have no idea what they're talking about. I left.  I am devastated. The reason I wasn't diagnosed sooner is because my grades were great. Now they're not, and apart from them, my life is a mess. I need help. She was my last chance.  Edit: thank you so much for the awards!!  Edit 2: since some people are asking, the other three people that diagnosed me were 1) a psychologist (sorry about the mistake). I'm currently going there and she's awesome, but we only ever talk about how I feel about ADHD, it's not hands on practical advice 2) an amazing psychiatrist which told me it was obvious I had it, but it's too expensive for me to go back there 3) another psychiatrist who told me that since elvanse made me feel awful (it helped A LOT with ADHD symptoms but I didn't sleep or eat for days) she couldn't do anything else and advised me to "get used to it". This was the college's psychiatrist.
