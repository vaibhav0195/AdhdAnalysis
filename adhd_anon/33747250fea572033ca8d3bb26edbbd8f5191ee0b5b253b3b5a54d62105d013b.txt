I feel like my whole life is about to restart and I can start doing better from here.;;;I'd like to thank this thread for the continuous support! You guys are awesome.  Edit: wow, thank you all so much! 😊❤️ I'll answer all I can!  Edit edit: for those misunderstanding, I am not swearing by Vyvanse after day 1 of taking it! I haven't even taken it yet. I simply meant by receiving this diagnosis and help, I feel completely understood and I feel like my life is just beginning! Thanks for all the love you guys!
