So my usual coworker is a guy from Syria, he's really nice, works hard, and he's generally a very chill dude. He just doesn't speak the language that well yet. We've figured out a way to communicate though, so there's no problem talking to each other.   A few days ago he was sick, so my boss sent out a substitute to help me at work. She was a white woman, a little older than me, and seemed pretty nice. Everything went well, until lunch.  While eating lunch, we were talking, and the subject suddenly fell on my coworker. She started saying that he's probably a "lazy immigrant", "doesn't do shit", "won't even learn the language", shit like that. I quickly shut her down because I don't tolerate that shit.  And she had the AUDACITY to say "oh, sorry, my ADHD makes me a little racist"  To which I replied "no, it doesn't"  And she asked me "I'm sorry but you don't have ADHD so you can't say anything about my condition"  And I answered with "I have ADHD as well, it doesn't make me racist. You're just a racist who happens to have ADHD"  And the topic got changed so quick.  I'm still so mad about it. There are too many bigots who blame their bigotry on ADHD. It puts everyone else in a bad light.
