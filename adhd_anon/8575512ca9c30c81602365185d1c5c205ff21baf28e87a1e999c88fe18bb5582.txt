His brothers were being very rambunctious, we were packed in a very warm and stuffy car, and needless to say I was feeling very overstimulated. The brothers kept getting out of the car and running around the lights, which made me really nervous. I suppose his mom didn't mind, but my boyfriend and I did. I think she took our discontent with the brothers' antics as being scrooges. I was particularly annoyed because when I'm overstimulated, I get really pissy and that in of itself annoys me so it's a never-ending cycle.  At some point, the mom just turns to me and says, "you know, I like you better when you're off your meds. You're more fun that way!" The ironic thing is that my meds had worn off at that point. That WAS me off my meds. If they hadn't worn off, I might've been able to handle everything better. I told her, "Well, my meds have worn off by now so..." I don't think she heard me.  My meds make it so I can remember things, I can read better, I can articulate myself better, I'm not so angry all the time, and I'm way more confident in myself because my meds help me do the things that I know I can do despite my ADHD.   This is not to say that the person I am without my medication is a bad person. They are the same person. My unmedicated self is not unlikeable and broken. I'm not obligated to be unmedicated or medicated to please other people; I'm medicated because it helps me function in this weird world where disabilities and mental illness are seldom taken into consideration or met with empathy.  It can be tough to love ourselves when we are overwhelmed, overstimulated, fighting impulsive or intrusive thoughts, or anything that ADHD makes us believe. Even more so when people we love don't make an effort to understand this.
