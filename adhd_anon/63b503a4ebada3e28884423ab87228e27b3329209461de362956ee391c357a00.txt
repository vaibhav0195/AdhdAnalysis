It has taken me 13 years of post secondary education to finish what should have been done in 7 years.   But it was worth it! Iâ€™m done and I fucking did so well!!!!    I am literally so happy about this and can not wait to publish and show the world more and more of my stuff.   Getting diagnosed in the last year made the biggest difference.    Thank you to this community for being supportive throughout all of this. I love you guys.    **EDIT: You guys are so amazing and supportive <3 I love all of you. Honestly, I don't think anyone outside of this community can really appreciate how much of a struggle it can be to get through life stuff. And being able to share and celebrate this with you guys makes it all the more meaningful. GO TEAM ADHD! ***
