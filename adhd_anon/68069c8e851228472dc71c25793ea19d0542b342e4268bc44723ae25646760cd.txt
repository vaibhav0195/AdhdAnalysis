He's introducing me to the new bonus system. I ask intelligent question. We have a nice conversation. I feel like a confident young professional.   Enter the fucking squirrel running across the street in front of us.   I deadass yell: "Oh, look, a squirrel!"  It's been nice knowing you guys. Tell my cat, I love her.   Goodbye, cruel world.
