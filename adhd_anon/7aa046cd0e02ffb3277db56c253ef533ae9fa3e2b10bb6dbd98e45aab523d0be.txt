7aa046cd0e02ffb3277db56c253ef533ae9fa3e2b10bb6dbd98e45aab523d0be;;;Emotional Dysregulation should be discussed as much as loss of focus with ADHD, if not more.;;;Since my diagnosis and subsequent therapy/treatment, I've been able to identify **how little I'm actually in control of my emotions and how frequently my emotions flare up.** I was diagnosed late(\~25 y/o) and looking back at my childhood/teenage years, there were **hundreds of instances of my emotions running wild without me being able to control them**. During this time, I was able to manage a 2.0-3.5 GPA but **my social life was tumultuous and frightening**. I **lost a lot of trust in those around me** because I thought they **just didn't care as much as I did**, or because **I thought I hadn't done anything to deserve the treatment I received**.   I only wish the aloof, lost-puppy-looking stereotype of ADHD **also included the inability to regulate emotions**, as I think that's one part of ADHD that is **known to some but not most**. It's also a piece that **can be misinterpreted by outsiders as a short temper, or a weak spine, or wearing your heart on your sleeve.** I wish that, one day, non-ADHD folks **could recognize emotional dysregulation alongside loss of focus as symptoms of ADHD and not a lazy, emotional slob**. Maybe it's just me projecting my insecurities, but it feels like the combination of symptoms is often **mistaken for willful lazy assholery.**   Now that medication is helping me with the focus part, the next step(and the harder part imo) is **learning to identify when my emotions are beginning to control themselves** and **how to co-exist with them**. My new goal is to **re-develop healthy social habits** and **the ability to reach out to find new friends.**   Wish me luck, r/adhd. And **may your journeys take you to where you want to go.**
