d79bbf428a358184500260136b1633404b936506ee29ca69544310bb0e542a5b;;;I (23 M) just discovered this sub and I’m in tears.;;;I’m just 16h away from this test i just started studying and it took me 6h to study 19 pages i don’t even know i’ll remember.  Just deleted a good chunk of this post because I couldn’t remember what the hell I was gonna say, anyways, here’s to you magnificent chuckleheads for being amazing and so understanding of each other.   I’ll do my best to ace that test thanks to the joy this sub has brought me for the past hour or so.  Edit: thanks to the kind strangers who popped my award cherry!!
