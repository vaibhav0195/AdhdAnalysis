I joined this community to gain a better understanding of people diagnosed with ADHD. I've taken tips, tricks, and strategies from the posts in order to help my students. There was a time in my life I thought people with ADHD were just lazy and undisciplined. Your stories have helped lift the veil of ignorance and helped me find more empathetic footing.  I know that there are varying views on medication in the community and my own views used to lean towards the negative side. Why can't my students just learn to do the work on their own? Why do they need to rely on medication? Someone posted (and I've read several echoes) about how the medication levels the playing-field. It doesn't give you any unfair advantage, it just takes away the disadvantages you've been playing with.  Last night my husband and I were talking. He's been self-medicating with drugs and alcohol for years. He's been afraid to start medication because he thinks he should be able to do it in his own. Because of this community, I convinced him to talk to his therapist about medication. We discussed how  it won't be a cure all, it will take time to find the right medication and dosage. And we'll continue to develop his coping strategies, but it's my hope the strategies he's already using will be more successful and long-lasting.  I just wanted to thank you all for sharing your stories. You've helped me become a better teacher and advocate for my students. And you've helped me become a better partner to my husband.  :edit: thank you for the silver! It's my first!  ::edit:: thank you for your kind words and continued advice! And thank you for the numerous awards!
