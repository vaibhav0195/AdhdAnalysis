One of the first things we tackled with my therapist was having a fixed morning routine and logging it every day.    Today was the 71st day of keeping up with that. I know it’s something everyone just does without thinking but for me it feels like I’ve climbed Everest!   A big shout out to my therapist who kept me motivated in the friendliest way possible and another one for my doctors and nurses for how much they supported me :)  [Look at my cool routine graph!](https://i.imgur.com/k6WYt2P.jpg)  **Edit**: This blew up! Thanks for all the love and the awards <3 <3 <3  Here's how I did it (sorry for the wall of text lol):  So I tried keeping a morning routine a few times, but never succeeded to keep if for more than a few days. I tried many habit apps for this but I couldn't stay motivated with them. Apps are mostly designed to do the routine at a particular time and most of them 'punish' you if you break your streak. Also, I couldn't find an app that let me journal my way and track whats most important for me. I also tend to zone out between the different steps of my routine, so I needed an app to kind of nudge me when that happens.  And I used to get disheartened and give up if I couldn't start on time or skip a day. My therapist helped me get over that and we decided I just do it and track it, and not aim for doing it every day or starting exactly on time. This, along with just freely logging the start and end times without any pressure to be on time helped me maintain my streak :)  With my morning routine I do 5 things every day:  1.  wake up (lol) (1m) 2.  make tea and practice learning a language (15m) 3.  shower and get ready (40m) 4.  eat breakfast and take meds (20m) 5.  go for a short walk outside (15m) (or leave for work)  I use an interval timer app to set up a stepped interval timer for all of the above steps. I use [MultiTimer](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/multitimer-multiple-timers/id973421278) but you can use any other similar app. It is free. The timer pauses after each step and sends you notifications every few seconds till you resume the next step (very very useful if you zone out).   After all steps are done I log the start and stop time into an Numbers file (Apple's Excel) along with a star rating for how many things I completed (5 stars = did everything) and another star rating for how I felt after the routine. Optionally I also write down what went well (eg. feeling fresh) and what didn't go well (eg: didn't sleep well, zoned out, etc.). [This is what it looks like](https://imgur.com/a/gMHpNNw)  I created the Numbers file on my phone and then spent a good amount of time playing with the format and colours till I liked it. It automatically calculates how much time I took and takes a median of all my ratings, start times and end times. And it also plots a cool graph of all the start/end times.  Here's the the Numbers template: https://we.tl/t-sYChvm5bOC (I sadly don't know how to do it in Excel/Google Sheets, but if you wanna try it, feel free to ask me any questions!)
