You don't know where the line is.;;;edit: i used to take the "Blame everything on myself and ADHD is not an excuse and a cop out" approach in high school but i was beating myself up so much it was to the point where i was having suicidal thoughts because would hate myself so much. Now i know much more about ADHD and the affects it has on people and i began accepting myself a little bit more. But i i want to get anywhere i have to hold myself accountable, however i am afraid i will end up beating myself up again much like in high-school so im hesitant on how much do i hold myself or probably what is more correct how do i hold myself accountable without beating myself up. Because i don't want to put myself down over things i can't control.
