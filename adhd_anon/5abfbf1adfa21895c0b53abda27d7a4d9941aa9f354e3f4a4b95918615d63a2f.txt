The pressure of outside accountability, rigid structure, constant social stimulation, and tons of extracurriculars I was interested in helped me compensate a ton.  I had no clue just how much that was holding me together. Turns out my world was hanging by a thread. I completely fell apart during quarantine. No sleep schedule, no exercise, no socialization, constantly lonely and hyperfixating on my few online relationships, unable to work on my passions, stumbling into panic episodes and despair about what I'm going to do with my life, feeling like I didn't recognize myself. The covid world is terrible for ADHD brains. I can hardly think of a scenario worse for us. It sounds like something out of a sci-fi novel: complete lockdown of all interesting and stimulating activities, you can only do things on your computer in your room now. I had to quit uni last semester, got diagnosed two weeks ago. It's a relief in some ways, but also terrifying to know that my ability to function normally was dependent on factors entirely outside of my control.  Hoping others feel this way. Covid is a nightmare scenario for ADHD brains. I'm struggling to remember that the world used to feel interesting at all. Anyone else just hanging on by a few hyperfixations? Feeling like I'm really going to lose it if things don't improve this summer.
