But Im fed up of being told I have a superpower.;;;I cannot make a 45 min meal in less than an hour and a half. 30% of the time its gonna be burnt. Im never going to put every single item of dirty clothes to wash. I can't keep up with an argument because I forgot my side and half of what the other person said. An organized plan becomes an improvised mess because I skipped a step. A set of instructions given to me seconds ago no longer exist within my brain.   A hunter gatherer wouldnt thrive with this condition. Forgot what berries were poisonous vs delicious? Bad. Arrived at the hunt with your spear unsharpened? Very bad. Without your spear?  Better punch that mammoth pretty hard.  Creating a company? Amazing!! Just don't forget that very important tax record!!   The hyperfocus and creativity and extra energy are incredible tools, indispensible in many areas of life.   But that's not a superpower. It's not a disorder that someone is lucky to have.  Edit 10h later:Hi everyone!! Really honestly did not expect this to blow up, thank you all for tips and kind words and shout out to all of those who can relate!   Here we find that we are not alone and most importantly, that even whith ADHD many of us can find ways to cope and keep moving forward towards our goals!  Oh and for those concerned, thank you very much but this post is not me giving up, it's just a need to get it off my chest.
