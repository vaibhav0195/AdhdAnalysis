3f83a12592be0a525fd66f27ec7fc73ca673b5fcd21d73810e4acbfde7244663;;;I Got High Praise At Work;;;I am a 48 year old, with an adult ADHD diagnosis. I take Vyvanse in the morning and a low dose of Adderall shortly after lunch. I work in a highly technical field and documentation for how we implement different solutions is part of my purview. Like most of us would, I hate this part of my job. I generally put it off as long as I can then try to make sure a 10 year old could successfully implement the solution following my documentation.   Today I was informed that my documentation is used in every region as an example of how documentation should be done. While I know I write well and I know my documentation is good I would have never thought that it would be the gold standard for a company. The global IT manager told me that I write the best documentation in the company.   I can honestly say it was a much needed boost. I'm always exhausted and completely useless after a documentation run. The compliments aren't going to change that but it does make me feel better about the effort it takes to do that part of my job.
