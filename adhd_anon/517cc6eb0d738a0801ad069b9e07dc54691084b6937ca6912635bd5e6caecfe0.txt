Cant believe my luck.;;;Hey guys  Ive been noticing a slight pessimistic tone on this sub today. When I feel like the most miserable chaotic failure of a person ever to have lived, I remind myself of a few important facts.  “Modern” Homo sapiens, that is, people who are roughly like we are today, have been around for at least 50.000 years. Since then, more than 108 billion members of our species have existed on the planet.  If ADHD has been affecting people on a similar level as today, that means around 4.3 - 6.5 billion individuals have struggled through life on this planet with the disorder. These are whole lifetimes of shame, confusion, and general crap taking from the world at large, without any understanding, treatment or help available.  in that context, we are so incredibly fortunate to be alive during this tiny snippet of time, just around 30 years,  where the condition has been scrutinized and finally understood by science, and (for the most part) accepted as a real thing by mainstream society. We now have the most amazing medication and information available to us, ncluding this amazing community here on reddit.  Thanks Universe, Steven Hawking, God or whoever put me here at this exact time and place in the human timeline.  &#x200B;  edit:      This post really made for some great discussions! Glad I managed to cheer some of you up. (and piss some off) But all is well that stirs well. Thanks all who contributed!       Its important to note that I went through 30 years of life undiagnosed. During that time my baseline was on a different planet. It was a rough, debilitating mental state that I never want to return to.  During that time I had to literally force-feed myself with positive sentiments like this just to stay afloat. ADHD affects us all differently, and we all have different strategies to manage it, and  this sub is the perfect place to share our thoughts on that.      &#x200B;
