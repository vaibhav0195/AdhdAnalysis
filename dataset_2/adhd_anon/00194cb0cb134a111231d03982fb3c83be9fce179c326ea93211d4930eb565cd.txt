I was diagnosed with ADD when I was 8. I have been making it through life, but relationships suffered. i am a single father and man added on top of everything else. I decided enough was enough and went to see a doctor. i was diagnosed with ADHD. He prescribed me adderall, but I can not afford name brand. I took the generic, but could not sleep last night at all? Then today I was a jittery, but I refused to miss my workout. So no sleep. This is my second day and honestly I am thinking about cutting each pill in half and only taking two instead of three. Now I may not get the high feeling but that is not what I want. I just want to focus, be more attentive to my family, socialize, and sleep? Any advice would be well taken.
