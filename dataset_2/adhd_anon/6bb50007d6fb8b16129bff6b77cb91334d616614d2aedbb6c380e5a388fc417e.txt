Should I try asking college students for pills? If so, how?**  Edited for clarity.  Ok, here's the long version: I've recently obtained an official diagnosis of ADD. I've known for a while, if that makes sense - three high school teachers and a college prof went to my parents asking that I be tested, and a family member who is a child psychologist has been urging me to get a diagnosed for over a decade.  Anyway, I went to do this because due to life changes (baby, promotion), I cannot hold it together anymore. The behavioral modifications that helped me in the past aren't sustainable right now. The diagnosing psychologist recommended medication.  I would probably have never risked the expense of the evaluation if things hadn't gotten really bad. I am not, repeat NOT, functioning as an adult right now. I can take care of the baby (because god forbid that I should screw that up), but concentrating so hard and so long to stay steady with her is making my work suffer, and I can't manage anything else in life. I'll go three or four days in a row without eating at home or showering. To clarify, I am not depressed, just so distractable right now that it's taken me 3 hours to write this post. It's bad.  Anyway, the diagnosing psychologist can't prescribe medication. He's working with my general practitioner. SHE can't get me in for a visit for a month! I feel like I need help right away. Is it stupid or short-sighted of me to consider purchasing black-market prescriptions to get through the wait? I have no idea how to go about it, either. Can anyone advise me?
