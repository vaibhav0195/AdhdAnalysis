For a bit a of a back story, it's always been obvious that I've suffered from ADHD, and I've been "tested" and diagnosed twice now, but somehow I just stopped renewing my Adderall prescription, and moved away from home, so I can't go back to the doctor that prescribed me in the first place. I have recently gotten a new doctor close to my university though, and I had all my past information transfered to him, but it was super obvious that he was very skeptical of everything I was telling him in regards to my symptoms.   So for a while now, I've attempted to just deal with it, trying every "natural" remedy on the market, but it's gotten to the point where nothing works, and a combination of the ADHD and the anxiety it causes has taken over my life. I'm unable to study, put off assignments until literally the last minute, zone out in the middle of lectures and even regular conversations. It's killing my social life and my education.  Back to the original question then, how can I possibly get help for this, and get the only thing that's made me feel remotely close to "normal" for as long as I can remember without seeming like I'm fishing for "study drugs?"   Thank you in advance, and sorry for the essay.
