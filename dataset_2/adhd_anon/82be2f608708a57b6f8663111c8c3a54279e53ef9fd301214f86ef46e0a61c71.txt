82be2f608708a57b6f8663111c8c3a54279e53ef9fd301214f86ef46e0a61c71;;;I need help to describe ADHD to others because people assume I'm dumb, lazy and selfish. Can you help me? ;;;Getting an official diagnoses in a couple of weeks but both my psychologist and psychiatrist are sure I have it but are meeting together to collaborate all of the testing they have done in me  While I struggle to not believe that I am not just dumb, lazy and selfish my doctors assure me that this is all just part of ADHD   How can I explain to people when they are talking to me and I don't respond properly or don't listen that I really don't mean to be rude, or when my house is trashed but I do everything to avoid tidying it that I'm not being lazy or when I refuse to sit down and play a game or watch a movie that I'm not being selfish, or that when I'm failing drastically with paperwork that I'm not trying   How do others describe ADHD to others so they don't just think dumb, lazy and selfish are a part of your personality?
