Looking for Advice, Experiences etc. (X-post from r/ADD);;;I was diagnosed with ADD when I was seven or eight years old. When I was thirteen my mother decided that I didn't need medication any longer. I'm thirty three now and, partially because of this [webcomic](http://raisedonritalincomic.blogspot.com/) I read the other day, I realized that I've been plagued with the symptoms of ADD my whole life. I freaked out when it first occurred to me because all I could think about was the entirety of my adult life under the thumb of these symptoms. After about ten minutes of being extremely angry and scared I started doing research and looking for recommendations for psychiatrists/psychologists. I'm going to an Adult ADD group and a therapist on Monday (therapist who was recommended by my friend's therapist). Part of me just sort of wants to find a doctor who will give me a prescription so I can hurry up and get on with making the changes I want to make but I know that this is going to be a process. I guess I'm just looking for suggestions as far as making this as inexpensive as possible. I'm not opposed to working with someone and learning how to manage my time more effectively without medication but, from some of the posts and comments here, I gather I might just be spinning my wheels without them. I think I'm taking the right steps but I don't really have anyone to consult with at the moment (well, until tomorrow, I guess).
