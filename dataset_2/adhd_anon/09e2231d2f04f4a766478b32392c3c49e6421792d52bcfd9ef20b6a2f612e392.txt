I can't ever be interested in one thing for an extended period of time. One thing that makes me happy one day, the next it will quite literally put me to sleep. I'm not sure if this is due to obsessing and then consequently burning out, or if it's simply a temporary loss of interest (or more specifically, stimulation).  I'm always deeply interested in certain topics and I'll research the hell out of them, so I can understand the fundamentals of very specific topics. For instance, I'm very interested in Art, Science, and History. A subject that grabs all of these at once is photography, and the amount of information to be gathered in each of those categories is amazing! I'll find myself up until 5 in the morning figuring out the chemical process of photographic film. I find that very interesting. But the next day, it's gone. And if i try to think about it my brain gets sleepy.  What i'm getting at is, i'm afraid that this obsession with photography will eventually fade. And all of this knowledge gained will be in vain. I'm a horrible photographer, I don't think i've ever really taken a good image. But the science that goes into it fascinates the hell out of me. Now, at least. I know this will probably fade. As does all the obsessions i've had before hand. And I just don't know what i'm going to do. How can I find a career? How can I find and do something that I love? How have you all done this, and how long have you had the job you're working now? I know there are a lot of questions here. I guess i'm just venting.   tl;dr, I don't know what to do with my life because the things that interest me now probably won't in the future. How did you all find fulfilling careers?
