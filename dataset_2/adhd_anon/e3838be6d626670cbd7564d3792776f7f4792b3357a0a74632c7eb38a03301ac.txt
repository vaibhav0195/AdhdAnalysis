I'm 25, graduated with a finance degree and looking for a new position. I was diagnosed with ADD last January after my life almost falling apart in the few years after graduation and am now fairly certain what I need in a position to feel good about what I do. With the stigma ADD holds with some people should I disclose that I have this at any point in the interview process?
