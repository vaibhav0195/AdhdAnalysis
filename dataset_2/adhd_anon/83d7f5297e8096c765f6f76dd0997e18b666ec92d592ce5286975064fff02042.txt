83d7f5297e8096c765f6f76dd0997e18b666ec92d592ce5286975064fff02042;;;The Worst thing (for me at least) about being Adhd.;;;The emotions I feel seem like they aren't mine sometimes, and i forget why I'm feeling them at all. I can't for the life of me enjoy a feeling for long enough before my brain flips the switch from righteous anger to laughing and jokes. I'm tired of being a clown, and dammit I just want one night where for 3-6 hours I can feel low. My whole childhood involved failing school, trouble, and consequent grounding, throwing out toys, no friends, basically a bed, clothes, and four walls, but I was never troubled by any of this, i would just find something like a rock or a stick and forget all about toys and everything else. I don't think I've ever fully appreciated the gravity of ANY situation.     Tl;dr Forever a jovial guy and I hate myself for it.
