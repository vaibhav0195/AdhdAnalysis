I've been diagnosed with ADHD a few years back, been on medication, then went off it due to conflicting medical issues. I have an issue where I tend to collect things; games, sprite sheets, rule books, you name it. The only problem is, I tend to leave these things up on the shelf and just admire them.  I get very happy when the Steam Sales start rolling because that means more games to add to my collection, great! However, after owning 1,000+ games, I still don't think I've touched a good 70% of my library. I don't really know why, a lot of these games are of critical acclaim, but I usually just end up playing a low investment game like DotA or Binding of Isaac as opposed to start up a brand new story game. I really would like to figure out an ethic that can help me clear up my backlog. Games are an example, but applies to nearly everything in my life. I tend to start things, lose interest and then never pick it up again.  TL;DR: What's a good way of helping me finish something from start to end?
