e8ea8c4210ef11ef77fa4594dd04c843448ddda8d13b2e0bc8cfbec3409f330c;;;I'm concerned about the Adderall XR euphoria, is this a sign that im not really ADHD?;;;I was diagnosed with OCD and ADD when I was 6 years old.   I recently went back on Adderall but I still get that "manic, euphoric, almost hyper focused energy for the first few hours after taking it.....is this a sign that I may NOT actually have ADHD, or is this a side effect of the medicine that everyone gets?  (PS. I dont "chase" that feeling, but it still is concerning. I hear that adderall usually "calms" ADD people, but it makes me energetic and focused and very talkative and confident.)  Is this normal?
