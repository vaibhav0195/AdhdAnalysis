I notice relief of my symptoms for about 2 hours and then the inattentiveness and restlessness comes back. From what I've researched, it should relieve my symptoms for 4-8 hours. Is my dosage too low? Should I schedule an appointment with my PCP to address the issue?   EDIT: Could it possibly be due to my body mass? I'm 5'11 and 205 pounds.
