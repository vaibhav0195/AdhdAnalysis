Heck, I'm not even doing the "right" thing right now (English paper to write), but if this turns up anything for me, I figure it could help me out in the long run.  In any case, I and my brother were diagnosed with ADHD last year.  We both went on meds, but I suffered from serious depression, and as a result, haven't been interested in trying something different. Plus I don't even have the motivation to go do it, which brings me to my concern.  I watched the videos by Dr. Barkley that were posted on a thread here, and as much truth as he speaks, it depresses me.  I believed that there was something I could do about my ADHD, my lack of motivation, and my nearly complete inability to manage my time wisely, but what he tells me says otherwise.  Especially this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3VuV5Jvazs  I guess I'm just looking for other's response to his videos and/or some advice/help on what to do next. I want to be motivated (I want to be a talented and great designer one day), but now I fear that my ADHD will keep me from doing so.  Actually, I've always feared/known that, but now it's been articulated for me. So.. advice? Help? Stories of awesomeness?  Links to a thread where this is already been done?  Thanks. :)
