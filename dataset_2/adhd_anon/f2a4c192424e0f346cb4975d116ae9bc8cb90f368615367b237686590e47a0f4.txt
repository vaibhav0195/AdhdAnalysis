I started with Adderall XR at 30mg and I felt all the wonderful help this medicine gives people who suffer from ADHD. After a few weeks, that effect went away. I told my doctor this and he increased my dosage to 60mg and asked of I wanted to try Vyvanse. I said yes, because he mentioned it was stronger. Unfortunately, I feel nothing from Vyvanse at 60mg. I am just frustrated that I have to go higher in dosage. From what I understood from my doctor, once you hit the right dosage it will click and the medicine will be effective. But anything below that will be ineffective. Has anyone else experienced this process of finding the right dose? Any advice on what to look for with myself or explain to my doctor when I go in again?
