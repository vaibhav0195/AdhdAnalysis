There's gonna be a little backstory here, but if you just want to get to my question it's at the bottom. I was diagnosed with ADHD by a professional around my sophomore year of high school, and took vyvanse (with relatively disappointing results) up until the end of my junior year, when I stopped completely, thinking I didn't need it. My senior year was relatively easy, but I've been struggling now that I'm in college. I'm a second semester freshman, by the way. A couple of times this semester, I've taken a 15mg adderall tablet in order to study or write an essay, and the difference has really been like night and day. The dread and procrastination I usually experience changed into a genuine joy in the intellectual activity I was undertaking. Because of this, I've been thinking I might actually benefit from a prescription, and that vyvanse may not have been the correct medication for me.          **On to my question**: If I go to a doctor seeking an adderall prescription, will I need to be re-diagnosed with ADHD, or will he or she be working off of the previous diagnosis I have from a few years ago?
