5c1e71b1753f815601e5ce25606302ddb05549b5a277fa20e8071c7f6cf71f09;;;New here (posted a few times) and a question;;;Hi all,   Fairly new to this sub, newly diagnosed a month ago with ADHD PI.  Took a whille with years of diagnosis of depression and other random ideas.  saw  psych for anxiety for a few years before i approached him with my  lifelong inability to focus, pay attention, absorb mutiple concepts or conversations at a time, etc.  add to that years of excessive exercise (now i realize my only way to settle my body so my brain could relax), anorexia and obsessive thoughts.  Addto that an abnormal high IQ, an ability to do what is expected, and a truckload of coaping strategies.   I'm! 41. Finally on meds...and it is like how i thought my brain should be.   I was also born 9 weeks early. I heard this can be a correllation.....anyone else a preemie?  Thank you in advance for the support.
