6657466ffa42458d3c746bde84d8b1b353271db8a4e28a5202e2ebfa307e9aae;;;I have become increasingly dependant on Aderoll inorder to produce superior works of writing;;;I was diagnosed with ADHD Inattentive type around March this year and have been trialling vsarious medications ever since.   At first I was prescribed Concerta, but soon switched to Aderall after I experienced a particularly intense migraine while on the drug. Aderall had little to no effect until I reached a dosage of 10-15mg which eventually became 30mg where it remained.                      When on the stimulant, I would experience moments of intense creativity which I  channeled in the medium of writing. I wrote various poetic pieces as well as other literary works. While under Aderall's influence, the writing I produced in rather prolific fashion felt superior to most of the writing I produced off the medication, but at times the work appeared no more superior in quality when viewed at a later date while off the medication.   Regardless, the feeling of producing work I could be proud of in an artistic manner soon grew addictive. It wasn't difficult to get my "fix" of this euphoria while in school, as I was alotted 30mg each morning prior, but as one would expect, my grades suffered significantly as I neglected completing the assigned work and in place produced said literary pieces.   This combined with the fact that I lost nearly 12 pounds since I had started the drug led to my parent's decision to have me stop taking it once on summer vacation. 12 pounds I assume is a good deal for a person of my weight and stature to lose, as I am already rather scrawny.                                                                               However, losing the weight was something I was honestly okay with, mainly because I had become rather insecure about my face being seen as "chubby". Regardless, a drop from 128 pounds to 116 is of course not particularly healthy for a 10th grade boy, but my self image waned everytime I would actually make an effort to gain back any weight.                                                                        The issue I'm currently faced with is a reliance on the medication. Often times when I attempt to write off of Aderall, the end product seems strained and mediocre, or at least feels that way while I'm writing it. Due to this, for the past month I've continued to discretely take the remaining 30 mg medication left over from the school year. In fact, I'm writing this shortly after taking the last of the pills.                                                                               My parents will most likely not notice the drugs absence as it's bottle was kept in a hodgepodge of other general medications which they never check.                                                                                I'm not really sure what to do now. I'll soon start gaining weight due to an increase in apetite, and immediately feel insecure as a result. I'll lose my ability to produce fufilling literary work, not too mention the ability to sustain focus. I just don't fucking know. I'm  not even sure what I'm asking here.   **TL;DR** Wrote well on Adderall, but lost 12 pounds in process. Kept taking Aderall behind parent's back after parents stopped providing it to me during summer vacation. Writing feels strained and poor when off of Aderall, and gaining weight hurts self confidence. Not sure what to do now that Aderall has run out.
