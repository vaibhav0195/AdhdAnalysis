Here are my ADHD-relevant subreddits:  * /r/productivity * /r/minimalism (less stuff, less mess!) * /r/fitness (exercise really does help!) * /r/keto (studies suggest that low carb/gluten diets may help with ADHD) * /r/GetMotivated  * /r/getdisciplined  * /r/personalfinance (for those who have difficulty managing their money)  **Yes, I do see the irony of using Reddit to help manage a disorder related to distraction and procrastination.**  I also use multiple Reddit accounts to manage my Redditing. This allows my frontpage to be less cluttered, and stops me getting *too* distracted/ overloaded when I'm on Reddit. This is all about personal preference, but I have dedicated accounts for the following, which are only subscribed to relevant subreddits:  * Weight loss/ fitness * Finance * Starcraft * Porn * Programming * Piracy * General entertainment/ posting (this one)
