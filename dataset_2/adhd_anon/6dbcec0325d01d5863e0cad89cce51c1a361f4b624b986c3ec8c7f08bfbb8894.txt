I would like to get responses from people who have tried "diet" remedies either themselves or on their kids for ADHD as a solution to ADHD. Personally i don't have much believe in diet remedies as a solution, i can't personally say my changes in diet have had any effect on my ADHD but then again i haven't tried it explicitly nor probably will i ever.  I view ADHD mainly as a genetic/neurological disorder, which modern research at least the last 10 years has indicated. I believe malnutrition in multiple or isolated nutrients can cause ADHD like symptoms and even ADHD misdiagnostic.  There does exist research that hasn't been identified as severely flawed to my knowledge that nutrients such as omega-3 fatty acids can help children with ADHD and specific learning disabilities reduce ADHD symptoms with a 'medium' statistical effect (.5) on some factors compared to a placebo group. Lower concentrations of omega-3 acids have been found in ADHD people but scientists do not know why which could perhaps indicate why omega-3 nutrients seem to help ADHD children over the placebo group. If you can debunk this research's methods then please go ahead. Research is located here (posted on a omega-3 website isn't assuring but google search suggests its legit)  http://www.omega-3health.com.au/Upload/Pdf/Effect%20of%20Supplementation%20with%20Polyunsaturated%20Fatty%20Acids.pdf  Anyway i would like to some input from those who have tried any kind of diet as a remedy to ADHD. Did you perceive it as something that worked or not. Obviously any result of this discussion here will not be unbiased but it would give a clue of how people regard these remedies.
