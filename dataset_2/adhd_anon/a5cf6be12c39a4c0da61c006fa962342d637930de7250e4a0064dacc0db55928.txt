a5cf6be12c39a4c0da61c006fa962342d637930de7250e4a0064dacc0db55928;;;Restless leg syndrome and ADHD;;;Here is the study: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9881529  I went to my doctor 6 months ago (I was 17, 18 now) about poor focus and perma-fatigue and he had me trying every single test that wasn't ADHD and even when we exhausted every other test he still wouldn't look at the possibility of ADHD due to my lack of restlessness  (and he hadn't even heard of PI-ADD).   In the mean time I have been medicating with a small amount of ritalin when I can get it, Ethylphenidate and 2-FMA. The last 2 are research chemical drugs which although I cannot recommend work almost as well as Ritalin.   One of the aisles of investigation was a sleep clinic that found I had restless leg syndrome which was preventing me from sleeping properly. They offered me Clonazepam but I declined due to its abuse potential and long half life. **Has anyone tried any other methods of treatment and can they also include the medications impact on their ADHD?**  As an adjunct, if you have ADHD and seem to require 8+ hours of sleep and still not feel well rested then speak to your doctor about restless leg sydnrome.
