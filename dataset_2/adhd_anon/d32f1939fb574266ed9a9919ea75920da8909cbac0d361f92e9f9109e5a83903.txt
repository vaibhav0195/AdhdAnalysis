If you missed that one.. I am ADD.. was diagnosed in 3rd grade (1994) and we seem to know more now than we did then. Like I am actually wondering if I am a combination of ADD and ADHD now. But anyways..  ..Well, I made an appointment with a Psychiatrist.. waited a month for said appointment.. and finally I reached my day in his office! I was feeling all sorts of things including anxiety and worry (Which if you know me at all.. that's me daily).   He prescribed me with Vyvanse for now and see how it goes and kinda go from there.   I am working towards having the proper medication which it seems like I'm well on my way in that respect, but also I want to become recognized by my college with having a learning disability and maybe begin counseling for issues with depression and anxiety.  Also, I was wondering if those of us here that are college students with ADD/ADHD do counseling via school counselor in the students with disabilities office? Or are you going to a Psychologist outside of your college? I think what I'm wondering is what all the school does/can do for you. I recently made a visit to speak with someone and they gave me a form for the doctor to fill out basically, but other than that I don't have any experience with what they can help with.  I have read that many come up with a school plan and a medication plan. While, I planned on coming on with a medication plan via my psychiatrist, I was wondering how to go about coming up with a school plan.. as far as studying and staying ahead since it would take me longer.
