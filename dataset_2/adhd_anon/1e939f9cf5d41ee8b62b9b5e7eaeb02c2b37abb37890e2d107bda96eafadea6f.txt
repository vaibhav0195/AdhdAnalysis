I always felt nothing was "wrong" with me, and refused medications all throughout high school. The longer I go through life the more I see the effects of ADHD on my work, relationships, personal relationship etc, so I'm seeking help through a local psychiatrist.   I was tried on Ritalin and was allergic to it. I also tried Stratera and it made me so absolutely tired that I could'nt fight the sleep. Some of my closer friends let me try an Adderall from time to time and that works really well, but I am scared about long-term effects of Adderall. What should I stay away from as far as medications go? And what all can be prescribed for ADHD, and does each different drug have a different purpose or do they all treat the disorder in the same fashion?
