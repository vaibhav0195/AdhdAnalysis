I feel like no.;;;When I was in 5th grade I was diagnosed with ADHD and went to maintain a prescription all through high school.  I remember this causing me some pretty aggressive fighting within the family because I wanted to be ‘normal’, and began refusing to take the medication. Went to college, was again prescribed something to address my ADD but in my rebellious mood I continued to refuse.  I worked hard, still do but was always in fast paced jobs that I was able to handle, waiting tables, then an on site IT job.  Though college took my 7 years due to ADD and full work load, I did graduate.  That leads me to today, 5 years later.  I’ve been promoted into a high paying position but the work load is heavy contract review - and I’m struggling big time, it’s causing anxiety and fear of failure, I read the same line sometimes 20 times before it clicks, I get up and walk around…I need help.  My question is, what do I do now?  I was denied coverage by my HMO and I’m not sure how to get a second opinion.  I took their test but it was a questionnaire and a computer test - don’t click the mouse when you see an x- that test.  Does ADD go away with age?   TLDR, Doctor said I don’t have ADD and won’t prescribed something.  I disagree with that.
