Is it possible that ADHD as a whole can be either caused by, or directly related to, the inability to maintain wakefulness, rather than simply the inability to control ones' impulses?  I know that I for one, have a VERY VERY hard time waking up in the morning. It doesn't matter how long I've slept, or how deeply I sleep. Every single day, when I wake up, I'm on another planet for a good 3 hours. I can also fall asleep at will, pretty much at any time - even while standing - the moment I get bored. I don't think this is a coincidence. Also, apparently narcolepsy is treated with the same stimulant medications as ADHD. For those who don't know, narcolepsy is basically the brain's inability to manage a proper sleep cycle. This results in chronic fatigue, and (sometimes) also results in the sufferer randomly falling asleep, even while completely alert and active, simply because the brain's sleep machanism "misfires". however, not everyone loses consciousness at random. More often than not, sufferers of narcolepsy just basically feel tired all the time, with crashes throughout the day. Thoughts?
