(So long, but I am so in need of encouragement :/);;;**TL;DR - High tolerance, so Adderall IR 60mg/day isn't overly helpful.**  **Doctor wanted to add another adhd med and get me off antianxiety pills, but sends me to psychiatrist first.**  **ADHD psychiatrist changes my dose to Adderall XR 40mg/day, tells me to stay on the antidepressant med, and that more strategies will do the rest.**  **I prefer the doctor's original plan. Is it wrong to go back to him to get his advice about her prescription? Am I *allowed* to go back to him and get a scrip? I feel badly for wanting a stronger effect / more medication.**   *These professionals are part of my college health system. The college is excellent in the medical field and I have had good experiences thus far.*  I saw **Dr. "Don"** (general practice doctor) to begin ADHD treatment. Ritalin did nothing. Adderall did nothing. I finally went up to 60mg/day on Adderall and began seeing improvements, but not much and not for every symptom. Hardly any side effects (not jittery, I can eat, I don't even feel it wear off except for becoming less focused). It's working well, but it doesn't seem like it's helping *much*.  **Dr. Don thought about starting me on Stratera in addition. He and I also thought it would be good to try to wean off my anti-depressant at this point, since I have found my anxiety source and am feeling a lot better. We didn't do this- just talked about it.**  Because 60mg/day is above the max, he needed to send me to the psychiatrist before deciding the next move. **Dr. "Joyce," who specializes in ADHD.**  He tells me she might want to keep me regularly until the medication is figured out. I am in her hands.  I met with Dr. Joyce today, and while I was nodding and agreeing in the meeting, I walked out feeling discouraged and uncertain about her decision.  * She's basically flabbergasted I'm hardly feeling my stimulant at such a high dosage. I felt like a medical marvel, or a mutant.  * She "hates" Adderall and wants me to consider Vyvanse or Concerta, because Adderall has the most abrupt onset and side effects (which I am not experiencing any of). * She doesn't want me to take Stratera on top of Adderall, she's a "less meds the better" kind of person. * "Meds won't open the book for you-" she stressed how strategies will fill in my gaps, which I get, but that's kind of what I've been trying to do my whole life to no avail. * She said there's no way to tell if it's really helping until school starts, though Dr. Don wanted it figured out BEFORE the stresses of school started. * She doesn't want me to stop taking my antidepressant anytime soon.  * **In conclusion: she prescribed me Adderall XR at 40mg/day for a month. My IR only lasted me 2-3 hours, so she thought long lasting would be better**. She said we needed to start with 40mg because she can't just start at 60mg (what I'm on now)- that's too far above the max.  So I'm to get the scrip, and report back to her in a month.  It all sounded fine during the time and then I thought...  &gt; *Wait, I'm getting LESS treatment when I went in saying it wasn't helping as much as I'd hoped? (we're talking as noticeable as a cup of coffee here)*  Her reason for a lot of the decisions were because of side effects when she knew I was experiencing hardly ANY?  **I feel like this might not help me more at all**. A month wasted? Not to mention the cost.  So, I'm tempted to schedule an appointment with Dr. Don for a "second opinion." I feel more comfortable with him, I trust him more, and his options made more sense to me. I have no idea if Dr. Joyce can "trump" him.  But am I being medication-greedy?   Will I ever get good treatment with such a high tolerance?  I know it objectively seems like I should trust the ADHD Psychiatrist. But... do I get the final say?  What will Dr. Don do if I tell him she disagreed with him and I like his idea better? Will he get in trouble?  CAN I even do this?  (They work in the same building, for clarification.)  ----   **TL;DR - High tolerance, so Adderall IR 60mg/day isn't overly helpful.**  **Doctor wanted to add another adhd med and get me off antianxiety pills, but sends me to psychiatrist first.**  **ADHD psychiatrist changes my dose to Adderall XR 40mg/day, tells me to stay on the antidepressant med, and that more strategies will do the rest.**  **I prefer the doctor's original plan.
