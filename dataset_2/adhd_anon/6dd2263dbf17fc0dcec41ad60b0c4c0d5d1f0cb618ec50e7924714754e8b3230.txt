For some it can be downright addictive. Ubiquitous smart devices make checking in on facebook, reddit, or other distractions a habit that we physically carry with us. Multiple mental health professionals have suggested that I attempt to cut back or cut off my use of sites like reddit.  There's no denying that the internet can be a distraction. So, how do y'all think ADHD folks should handle it? I love the internet! I don't want to quit! But if I can train my brain to have better focus, it's definitely worth it. I'd love to hear what everyone thinks of the internet as it pertains to ADHD -- just another distraction? Addiction? Potential danger? Or not a big deal?
