In our last show, we had a combination of alumni and current students, one of the alumni being a member of The Panic Squad which is a group that does improvisational comedy for a living (think of a mobile Whose Line team).  I just received an email from that guy where he has specifically asked me (and my brother, who has great on-stage chemistry with me) to be a part of the "Panic Squad and Friends" show that's coming up shortly.  I've been geeking/freaking out for the past 45 minutes and just needed to share this with this great community.  Thanks guys!
