I had no idea what these things were that were really negatively impacting me.  Anyways, I told my Dad about it last night and really struggled to convey what ADHD really is, or how to define it, other than saying I feel like my brain is in a fog and it'so hard to focus and I'm very forgetful.  Like many parents of people my age (30), they were probably hit over the head with ADHD talk when I was a kid.  So he didn't really understand what it was, or think it was that big of a deal.  And I'll admit, I didn't really understand what it was either when my therapist first suggested I might have it.  So what did you guys say to friends/family when you told them?  I have some great friends who are very understanding, but I want to be able to explain this properly.  Thanks!
