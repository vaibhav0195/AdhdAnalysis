feec335ddc906bfbf93110f60c553b4836ec3deeaa3e4d9fc534c4c7b290b2f4;;;Human Computer Interaction project to help ADDers;;;My group and I are doing a project for our HCI class to create a device or application or something to help people with ADD (and other who are generally forgetful and overwhelmed by life) remember not only to do things, but the things that need to get done.  Part of our project is to collect data from the experts, you know, you guys. :D  So, we have created the following two surveys and would be grateful if some of you would fill them out.  Thank you so very much.  http://kwiksurveys.com/s.asp?sid=tag7c18wb7u3zpy220703 and www.surveymonkey.com/s/Q2J7V7W  Thanks again!  And as a fellow ADDer, I really hope this works.
