What are your reasons?;;;Hello guys, I'm diagnosed with ADD (although I learned that's called ADHD now) and have been reading the post in /adhd for a while. I've seen a lot of post about people who have or want meds.   I don't use meds at this point, and I never had before. I was diagnosed (3-4 years a go) after I had my hi school diploma and figured I would just try without meds first - but with the knowledge of add/adhd and therefore some adjustments.   Out of curiosity, are there more people here without meds? What are your reasons? Are there people who use meds occasional, for example only at school/workdays?  Is there a difference in how you act and the stuff you do with and without meds?
