Since we were let out on Spring Break, I should've completed 5 projects. I had most of the week off and stayed in town. That anxious feeling of getting anxious from homework was the main deterrent. Now I have to go back and confront my instructor, who has already taken my accommodations in stride, and I know she will be none-too-pleased when I explain that I've got nothing ready for her to grade. I find motivation in microbursts. Those flashes of eagerness fuel me for about enough time to open up the document, and then burn out. I have no shortage of support. My housemate suffers from ADHD and currently works in the field in which I am majoring. I have a list of accommodations intended to ease my anxiety and enable me to produce quality work. I have the resources and knowledge necessary to complete these projects. I have an appointment with my professor tomorrow to do my assessment in an isolated environment. While I have her one-on-one, I'm tempted to plead for mercy, to try and make her understand the difficulties that I experience,  and to make what will likely be false promises. She's already given me her "not this shit again" face several times this semester. And this is my make-or-break semester. After this, its down coasting.   What should I do? I feel like I'm reaching the boiling point this time and I'm ready to throw in the towel.
