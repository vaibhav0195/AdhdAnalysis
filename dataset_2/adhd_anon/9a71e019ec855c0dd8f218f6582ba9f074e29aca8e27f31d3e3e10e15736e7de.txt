I literally was a better driver when I drove stick vs automatic. I have an inkling its because I had to focus on listening and feeling the car, watched my rpms, etc. Having those things constantly going through the back of my head was just enough of a distraction that I was able to focus attention on actually driving my car. I still ran a couple red lights here and there, but remained accident free.   Was just wondering if other people had similar experiences.
