Whenever I would miss a day in school everyone always talked about how quiet and nice it was when I wasn't there. I started to change to try to make people like me more and I was fine with it until recently. I'm almost 25 now and I feel like I'm wearing a mask almost all the time. I want to be myself but I really think everyone will hate me, and because of my past, that's seriously like the worst thing that could happen. I know it sounds ridiculous but that's what those kids so long ago did to me. I made a habit out of feeling stupid and annoying and now it's so hard to get my self worth back. How do I feel real again?
