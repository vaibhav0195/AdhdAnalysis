310d6657bccd1fbe99880d4a13f296986481612f4845daa2471bd97c16f0f248;;;I've been living in denial up until now, what to do next?;;;So basically I'm about to turn 18 and my whole life's been a mess, I failed out of school before but managed to get back on track with serious help from my mother, I'm going to graduate next year hopefully. Other than that I can't for the life of me focus on anything other than school (and that's just barely), and when I do - I completely neglect school and start sucking at it again. I managed to force myself to study but my room looks like a barn and I often forget to shower and let's just say if it wasn't for my mom I would look like a homeless person. I have all these great plans and I'm super motivated to kick life's ass but it's just so difficult to stay on track of my goals. Ever since I was a kid I just thought I was super lazy, and that's what everyone was telling me.   THEN I started reading about ADHD (I always knew about it, just didn't know exactly what it was) and started ticking boxes. I ticked every single one. My mom suggested before that we go to a shrink, because she was the one that had to put up with me after all. I always denied I was sick and would have these tantrums whenever she mentioned it. Boy do I feel dumb and sorry now. My mind is FILLED with stupid and unnecessary thoughts and I can't focus on more than one thing at a time, and even with that I need help.   I'm not officially diagnosed yet therefore I'm not popping any pills (I have an appointment in 2 weeks or so), so I would appreciate it if you guys could tell me what to expect aferwards, and if there are some tricks to battle with the symptoms before I get diagnosed because I have a million things to do and I'm starting to lose my motivation and confidence because I'm distracted. I have a lot more to rant about, but there's no reason to describe my symptoms in detail because you've been there, and I'm really not feeling capable to talk/type right now.
