Personally I've always done well in school, completed my work and aced exams. Right now I'm a student at a top uni not having trouble with my work or focusing when meeting a deadline that is close (like most people).  However, I feel very absent minded and often go off track. For example when I am coding I can start thinking about something completely unrelated and forget what I was going to do just seconds before. This happens very frequently. When I'm driving I have to actively focus, or the car in front of me could stop and I wouldn't notice even though I'm looking straight ahead.  No one thinks I could have ADHD because I don't have trouble with courses.   Was anyone in a same or similar position?
