So, we are trying Strattera. Started with 25mg, I'm up to 80mg. Was a bit scared at first because of all the bad reviews but...   It does seem to be working actually. Feel more clarity, easier for me to concentrate on things. Actually I've not even been having to take klonopin because of this med (so maybe my anxiety was ADHD related all along...)   However a month and a half later, while it is helping, I'm still getting horrible dry mouth and stomach aches.   Few questions and TLDR... -If you are on or have taken Strattera, did it help your anxiety or is that in my head?  -How long did your symptoms last?
