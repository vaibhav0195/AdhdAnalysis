Recently diagnosed (28) with ADD after making it through college and grad school. My new job really brought the symptoms to the surface so I sought help.   The doctor put me on Adderall 10 mg IR. I take one pill, twice a day.   It's totally wrecked by sleep. I was up until nearly 4 am last night. Finally fell asleep for a few hours and then had to get up. I took my first dose two hours later than usual, so I chose to half my second dose in the afternoon so I could sleep tonight. I checked with the pharmacist and he said it was fine.  Is this normal? I'm really over tired. I've seen the good that this medication can do. I just need reassurance. Thanks, guys.
