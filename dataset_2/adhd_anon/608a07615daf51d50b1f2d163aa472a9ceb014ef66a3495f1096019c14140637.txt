My doctor gave me the TOVA and said I am the combined subtype. I am very fidgety and talk without thinking. I have been hyperactive/ impulsive since I came out of my shell shortly before high school. When I was a child, however, I was very quiet and calm. I was never disruptive in elementary school. I have always been very inattentive and spend way too much time in lal-la-land. So, I am sure I have ADHD. But if I didn't have hyperactive symptoms until my teens, am I really ADHD-PI? Did anyone else have a similar experience?
