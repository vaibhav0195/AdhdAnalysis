While that may be understandable, I was on strattera for a few weeks prior and responded very well to it other than the fact that I eventually succumbed to some pretty severe headaches. In the end they called it a "neurodevelopmental disorder" - the context there being that I do have diagnosed aspergers. They acknowledged there were serious problems regarding concentration, focus and impulsivity. Problem was I tested too well on working memory and processing speed . Test involving focus and impulsivity was so bad it was "off the richter scale" and was deemed invalid.(One involving the letter X being shown repeatedly) What are my options now? Already looking at getting meds online but pretty afraid of a sketchy supplier. Can aspergers cause problems with impulsivity? Don't care about the label, just really want to get back on treatment ASAP- strattera was the best thing that happened to me in years (minus the crippling headaches :/ )
