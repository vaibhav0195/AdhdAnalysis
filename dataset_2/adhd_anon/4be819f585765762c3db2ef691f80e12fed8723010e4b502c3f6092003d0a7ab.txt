I constantly pinned this on my ADHD for a few years, but then my mom concluded that I was just being a little bitch who used ADD as an excuse not to do work. She said that if she could overcome her ADD and be the most fucking organized person on the damn planet, I could do my work. (which at this point, I seriously think she was misdiagnosed with ADD because she shows **no goddamned symptoms**)  Here's where I made the fatal mistake.....I believed her.  Enter the worst years of my life. Constant self-loathing, hating myself over my compulsive need to be doing something not productive even though I know I should be doing something else, and even kicking myself (literally) to get my stuff done.  Onto the medicine. One time my mom took my medicine to make sure it was safe for me to take (more reasonable than it sounds, I had been on a medicine that completely ruined my ability to sleep just prior to this medication), and she claims that she felt "extremely productive", and actually cleaned the entire house and half an hour. She said that if it could do that to her, I should be able to get my work done.  This time, I did not believe her. I had never felt anything like what she described, and I'm pretty sure she just went full-on wacko on Vyvanse. Despite this, I still hated myself for not getting my stuff done.  I found this subreddit today. I realize now that this is not entirely my fault. My medication doesn't work the way it's supposed to, but that isn't the problem. My mom always told me to "quit bitching" about my ADD, but I realize now that those weren't just complaints....those were my cries for help. I've lived with ADD my whole life and my entire family has been everything but helpful about it.  In mere hours, you guys have shifted my entire paradigm about what I'm dealing with now. This isn't some stupid excuse I use not to do work- this is a **real problem**, and some people on the Internet who I don't even know have helped me more in two hours than my own family has over the past five years. I just wanted to say thanks.
