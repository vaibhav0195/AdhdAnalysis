5b919d94f00d7923d87e63f83bc6646bbeadf6df68bfd1eb8f4c66bef041ab1d;;;I'm graduating from high school in less than a week..;;;Last summer I was diagnosed with ADHD and was put on adderall. This school year I've gotten the best grades that I have throughout all of high school (I held at least a 4.0 average each semester this year) and I scored a 1950 on the SAT without studying.  I'm going to college next year, and I honestly don't think I would of gotten in unless I had been given treatment. Just thought I'd share that with all of you. I'm really proud at the moment.   tl;dr I brag a little bit about overcoming ADHD and getting into college
