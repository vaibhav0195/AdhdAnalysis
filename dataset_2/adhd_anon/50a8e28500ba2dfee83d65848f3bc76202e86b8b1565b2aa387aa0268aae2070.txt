Well, to be fair, it's the part of the application letter but the first part, the introduction, where I present myself, ask questions about them and start a conversation, to which if deemed suitable, an application will follow...  So I have the questions noted down but I don't even know how to get started writing something like this and I fear my, as above clearly displayed, ramblings will be a hinderance. It should be stated I don't ramble when talking in person, it's just the writing is a monologue and that's where my brain spins out of control..  So far on topic at least, and **TLDR**: How do I present myself and ask questions in a letter without rambling? Does anyone else have these kind of issues with writing, and how do you get around it/use it to your advantage?
