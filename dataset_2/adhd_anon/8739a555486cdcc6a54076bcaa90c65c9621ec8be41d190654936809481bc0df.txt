How do you guys manage to have healthy eating habits?;;;Hey everyone! So, the title pretty much says it all. I was diagnosed with Adult ADHD a few months ago and just started taking a low dose of Vyvanse for about a week 1/2 now. It's helping quite a bit (not a miracle pill, to be sure, but I'm at least recognizing now when I'm doing incredibly absent minded things and feel like my thoughts have slowed down a bit), and I haven't really had any weird side effects, but, the eating thing is driving me nuts.  I basically forget to eat most of the day/have no appetite/when I am sorta hungry nothing is appetizing.  As a result, at night when the medication is wearing off, I find myself famished and pretty much snake-meal-ing a ton of food into my face. Then I feel gross &amp; full yet strangely still sorta hungry.   I just lost close to about 20 pounds  over the last 4 months through healthy eating habits and exercise (only 55lbs more to go until my goal weight!) and I am concerned that I'm going to now develop super unhealthy eating habits that will somehow prevent me from continuing my progress. I know thats a weird thing to say while you're on an ADHD meds since most people loose weight on them, but I haven't felt like I was pigging out on food like this for a very long time and it can't be all that good for me. On top of that, I also work a super physical job as a stage hand with a sorta weird schedule.   Tips on how to eat like a regular human would be good!
