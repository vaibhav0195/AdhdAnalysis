I strongly feel that I have ADHD. FOr example, just one of the thousand things. I've been discussing this with my wife. She gave me 2 jobs to do when she steped out for 30 minutes. Change the vacuum cleaner bag, and hang up a picture in the kitchen. She even consciously put the vacuum cleaner and painting in the middle of the floor so I can't miss it.   I seriously forgot in the space of the 2 minutes it took to check my phone because it buzzed, think about where to plug it in, to do both those chores. It was only because she left them in the middle of the floor and I almost tripped that I remembered. Anyway. I focused on those 2 chores and did my best to complete them properly. Found a nice nail (no small task given that I've been renovating the basement for 2 years and can't find SHIT) hung up the picture, changed the vacuum bag, I was so proud of myself that I could go back to my Crusader Kings game.  10 minutes later wife comes home and starts laughing. I'm like WTF DID I DO THIS TIME??  She lets me know that she can tell I've hung up the picture by the fact there's a hammer sitting by the microwave oven.   FUCK  Anyway. Back to the topic.   Let's say I go get diagnosed. How does a psychiatrist know that you have ADHD? What stops them from saying yes and just treating you anyway?  There's so much info/misinfo out there I can't even begin to start figuring out if ADHD is real, not real, it's in your head, requires medication, is a genetic trait, and physiological condition....  Sigh
