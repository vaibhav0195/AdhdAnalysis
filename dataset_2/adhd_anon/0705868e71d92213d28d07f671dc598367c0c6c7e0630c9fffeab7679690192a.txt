I was diagnosed when I was 6 with adhd and dyslexia. My mother overdosed me and I suffered mentally because of it. She stopped when I was 9 and ever since I refused to accept that I had a Learning Disorder, now a few semesters of college and it's kicked my butt. I finally went to the DSP office at my school and now I am sitting in a waiting room waiting to see a doctor to start the process to get diagnosed again.
