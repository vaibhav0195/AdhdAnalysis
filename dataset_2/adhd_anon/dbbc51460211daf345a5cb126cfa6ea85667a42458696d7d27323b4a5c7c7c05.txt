Unfortunately  before I found out i had already work and be terminated from 40% of the Healthcare Jobs in my city. I have no idea what i'm gonna do when my unemployment goes away. So i guess the question is when i have these interview with potential employers what do i tell them? Do I lie about the reason i was fired or tell the truth? If i tell the truth how should it be delivered. I don't know what to do anymore because its now frustrating. I use to be able to get a job like that but now it kind of hard.
