ed5ce6a0ec9571cf09058533ede24230e2113de87dd52a9a303fc8dc8070a1ce;;;ADHD in the uk.;;;I'm a 24 year old male and in a nutshell I've always have major problems with concentration, procrastination and other issues I recognise as possible symptoms to ADD. After a long talk with my friend who's brother was diagnosed, reflecting and doing research I really think I may have it.  My question is wether anyone knows about diagnosis and treatment in the uk? I have been thinking about going to the doctors for a whole (read: 3+ months) but don't know what to say and feel like I wouldn't know how to get what I'm thinking out properly, if that makes sense?  Any help or advice will be greatly appreciated
