I had a pacifier until I was 4 and a soft doll that I stroked constantly like I was playing a guitar (her dress was silky). Then she was taken away and I started carrying around satin pillow cases to rub. I also loved silly putty and sticky poster tack--I'd play with them incessantly and wouldn't go to bed without continuing to play with them, then wake up with them in my hair.  I'm still fidgety. I wear lots of jewelry to play with and keep little rocks and rubber animals at my desk at work. I've even made little beaded rosary-like things with all sorts of different beads on them just to fidget with.  Anyone else a lifelong fidgeter?
