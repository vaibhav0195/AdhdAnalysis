So basically I will fall asleep at some time during the day whatever I am doing, except I am outside or with friends. Some days its better some days worse and I just won't wake up through the day and feel like falling asleep again for the first 10 hours.   Back in school I was struggling to stay awake during the earlier classes and took a nap when I got home, so this isn't really a new occurence.   Also I immediately start dreaming vividly for about 10-20 minutes then i wake up.    I also score really high on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (about 19 points)   so I was wondering if this is beyond ADHD because I don't see it getting mentioned too often.
