I had to pay £88 for the prescription from Boots, wondering if anyone gets it on the NHS as an adult OR if anyone has a private prescription and gets it cheaper somewhere else? I think someone said it could be £60 at one of the supermarket pharmacies.   I'm also confused because it's used for treatment of ADHD in adults but the leaflet inside is only directed at children ("if you take too much medicine tell an adult!", that kind of thing). Same goes for the literature online.   I'm aware GPs will prescribe methylphenidate on the NHS if someone has an ADHD diagnosis, but I'm not sure about Elvanse?
