dafadf000b06babe9cf5b17e184ed00bf4efa74259d2fdf434ac7b7c3e14f5a7;;;Venting, I know you'll all understand.;;;Hey all I don't know why but i randomly decided to type adhd reddit in google. I'm from the UK and i was diagnosed at 23 with ADD (I'm the first adult to be diagnosed in the borough i live). I'm now 30 and get massive bouts of depression.  I sit hoping for the day I "grow out of it" I'm not a fan of doctors and ADD treatment in the UK isn't very 'advanced' the medication itself bothers me on top of the constant appointments and prescriptions... urgh   I recently had a random experience of about 4 hours with no ADD at all, no trace, I have no idea what caused it. It's weird but time moved so quickly but everything was so quiet. It's left me very depressed, I keep going back to it in my head and I miss it. Now that i'm getting on, hitting 31 soon, I keep seeing "specialists"; I've always been an avid gamer but I've never been able to stick to a game. Watching people who have dedicated them selfs to a single game or speed runners and tbh it carries on to anything, i can't help but imagine what I would of accomplished if I stuck to a single interest my entire life, it makes me incredibly sad.  I just wanted to vent to other people who know what it feels like. If you managed to read through the wall of text, thank you.
