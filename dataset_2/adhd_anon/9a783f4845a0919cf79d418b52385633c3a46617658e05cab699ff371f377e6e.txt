Basically, my friends and family are all very academic people, and my boyfriend, although very intelligent, has trouble following the thread when we have academic-based discussions. We're fine having these discussions on our own, but with other people, a big issue is that he never went to university, another might be that, due to his ADHD and/or other factors, he has trouble keeping up with our logic flow.  With friends, we don't have to go to the same parties all the time- I can have my friends and he can have his. I've come to see that's probably the best solution.  But with family... my mom just doesn't understand him. She says he doesn't "fit into our world," our world being comprised of, I suppose, very focused, academic sort of people. She thinks he's too "bouncy", etc. And he gets really quiet when we're having academic discussions... that's the crux of the issue for me. I don't care what she thinks about him bouncing off the walls, but I want us to be able to participate in higher level thinking discussions with my family, like we can do when it's just us. How have you dealt with this?
