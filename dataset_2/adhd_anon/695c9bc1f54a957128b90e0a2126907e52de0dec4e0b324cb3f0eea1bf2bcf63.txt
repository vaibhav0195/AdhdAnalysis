695c9bc1f54a957128b90e0a2126907e52de0dec4e0b324cb3f0eea1bf2bcf63;;;Wooo! I have an interview tomorrow! Meds are finally paying off!;;;I have an interview tomorrow for a PRN job at a hospital! I know it's not the best since I probably won't be guaranteed a lot of hours, but it's one step closer to getting my foot in the door somewhere and may possibly lead to a better job in the future!!  I was diagnosed with ADD about 2 months ago even though I struggled with it my entire life. I *finally* started meds right after graduating from college, though I wish I would have had the meds like 10 years ago...my life would probably be way different now. I graduated from college with a degree in Communications and Creative Writing - so finding a job has been nearly impossible. I had an interview about a month and half ago and they passed on me because I apparently made myself sound too ambitious for a regular job (it was at the UPS Store, they legit told me because I had a degree, they couldn't see me there in a year). I've been throwing out applications literally everywhere from retail to grocery stores to babysitting to human resources...this is the first time I've gotten a bite from a legitimate business (heath care providers).   This is only the second interview I've had since graduating in May. I'm super nervous/excited/scared/happy and reeeeally hoping that I can prove I am good enough for the job. Apparently there are 16 applicants and only 4 open positions....  I'll gladly take advice from anyone who has been in a PRN position (or registration/reception positions!) and general advice from people with ADD and how to ace an interview!  Wish me luck!!!!!!
