Thanks to be advice from this particular forum, I brought my elementary, middle, and high school records with me for evidence.  To anyone seeking an official diagnosis, I urge you to make this your goal. My psychiatrist even said she was about to refer me to a neuropsych specialist for an eval, but my records were so clearly textbook ADHD that she did not feel the need to, along with all of my recounts of past experiences.  She was understanding and informative, but most of all empathetic and really seemed to understand where I was coming from.  I was not a crazy forgetful person. My impulses's, my lack of friends, all of the projects that were started and never finishedâ€¦ Not the real me.    Ritalin was the first thing that worked for me four years ago. However, I stopped taking it once I forgot about it after I ran out.  I never really brought it up again to my doctor.    Until now. When reading all of your wonderful anecdotes and advice made me realize that I need to do something.  If not for myself, then for my family.  This psychiatrist has a wonderful plan. Try Ritalin, if it doesn't work we will try something else :-) there were no hoops to jump through, no extreme questionnaires, nothing to make me second-guess myself that I had made the right decision to try it and finally seek help.   Thank you all, again for everything. Sorry for the wall of text.   TL;DR- thanks and you're all awesome. (Bring school comments for initial diagnosis)
