She's undiagnosed and doesn't take medication.  Right now it's very difficult for her to get a job. She used to work in elderly care, but she says that the job was hurting her back because she had to lift people all the time. Right now she really doesn't have a lot of skills (especially where technology is concerned, but is trying to get a job at Walmart.  I know it's hard for older folks to get a job, especially when they aren't very familiar with "new" technologies (she doesn't even want to learn the cash register), but it's even more difficult for her because she has ADHD.  I was just wondering if anyone here has older family members that have ADHD that were/are in her position?   What jobs do you think are good for older people with ADHD?  ------------------------------------------------------------------  **tl;dr** Jobs available for older people with ADHD?

I'm, however, having one of those days though where I'd prefer to just be anyone but myself. I just wish I could be neurotypical and NOT have the low self esteem that has resulted from my ADHD.. The sad thing is that I still haven't been diagnosed, technically, though I'm sure I will be finally during my fall semester, hopefully.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  I'm in my graduate year of school and yet I feel incredibly behind my peers. I know some of this has to do with the dramatic socioeconomic differences between me and the other students.. But a lot of it is also because I've felt out of sync with my classmates, just as I have ever since I can remember. It also doesn't help that I'm introverted and pretty much have an avoidant personality because of the ADHD and general issues related to depression and my home life.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Sorry. Just wanted to rant in a place where others may relate.
