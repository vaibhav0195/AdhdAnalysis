25a03ce3cfdff185513b66bc236357d454166186bd3c8efaba5c31b1e57a5aac;;;What should I expect from meds?;;;I was rediagnosed with ADHD (along with moderate depression) last week by a psychologist, and I'm seeing my doctor again this week to hopefully get a prescription of some sort. The doctor doesn't want to give me Adderall or Riddlin because I've had them as a young child and didn't react to them well.  I'm wondering what a non-stimulant drug will do for me. I'm a full time college student, with several jobs. This semester has kicked me around, a lot. I've come to the point that I really don't care about my schooling at this point. I pretty much failed one course (haven't received my final marks yet), and I've been doing poorly because I just haven't been able to pay attention. Throughout HS and generals in college, I never had to study. Engineering courses seem to require a lot of study, and I just can't do it (not because I'm not intelligent or don't have interest generally).  Will the drugs "magically" help me to focus better, along with some motivation? I'm just so burnt out trying so hard, but one can always try harder, and I am all the more frustrated because of this.
