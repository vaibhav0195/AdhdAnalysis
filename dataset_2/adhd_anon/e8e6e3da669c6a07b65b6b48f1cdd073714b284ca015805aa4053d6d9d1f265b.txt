Meanwhile, I went to visit family in Colorado last week and smoked the whole time I was over there. While it's legal there, it isn't where I live. Today I was talking with someone who had mentioned her sons doctor drug tests her each month before allowing her to refill his meds. Now I'm really worried. We see my son's doctor in 2 days. Is this common practice? Will they care about weed or only care about making sure his meds aren't in my system?
