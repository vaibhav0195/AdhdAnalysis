67ce0987b264ead279e06dd0482cdfbee0709639d2534732ffa2e3a8d26f2ba6;;;I'm 20 and was just diagnosed with ADHD-Combined about a week ago, but I'm afraid to take my medicine for the first time. Hoping for advice :(;;;After this past quarter of finals and my uni, I realized that I can't keep working like this. I won't bore you all with my academic trail of suffering.  I started researching ADHD and came across this sub, (Thank you all for being here) and I identified all too well with what I was reading.  Last week after waiting months until reaching out for help, I officially diagnosed with ADHD-Combined.  I feel really uneasy about the whole thing, though.   Before being diagnosed, all I could think about was "What if it's just me? What if I'm lazy and just looking for excuses? What if I've done too much research about ADHD and now I've just started acting some of the symptoms? How could I really know for sure if the psychiatrist just has to rely on what I'm telling her?"  and mostly "I don't know what more to do if it isn't ADHD." and "I hope it's not just who I am."  Furthermore, my father, a family practice doctor, thinks that it's just my anxiety, which can mimic ADHD.  On another note, I was prescribed Adderall RX after being convinced by my doctor. I had wanted to take something that would have no chance of be becoming addicted to, (my family history struggles with addiction and I don't drink or have a Pintrest as a result) but my doctor insisted this would work best.  For all of these reasons, I haven't taken any of the medicine sitting on my desk. I don't know what kind of mindset I'm supposed to have about this. I'm worried to find out that it won't help and I was just looking for excuses.
