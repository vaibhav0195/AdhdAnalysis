Have you seen it negatively affect your experience?;;;Hi everyone, I'm 32, male and been in 3 relationships before this encounter.  So a couple of weeks ago, I had a great first date with this wonderful lady. The date went smoothly, 5 hours, great times, yadda yadda.  The 2nd date, I was working during the day and I take my medication that lasts the entire day. I started to obsess on what to do and how to make myself awesome but I just came across as... meek and uninteresting. It was still a 4 hour date and things were still feeling like they were headed in the right direction.  Yesterday, she was saying she just had some major allergy problems and had to recent some urgent care from a local hospital. I decided that I wanted to give her a pick me up, get her a smoothie or something to cheer her up. It got later in the day and it was another day where I take my medication. Instead of getting a smoothie, she just suggested to get dinner together. So we went out, I came off as uninteresting and just didn't really feel like myself again. Was obsessing again about what to do.  So this morning, she texted me that she wasn't feeling it romantically and cancelled our actual planned 3rd date tonight. I've been pretty devastated and I'm trying to piece together answers on what I was doing. I've come with a conclusion that I had 0 expectations, didn't have my medication on the first date, while for date 2 and "3." I did come across as someone that I'm normally not while dating. I never was comfortable and my mind was just super/hyper focused on how I was doing instead of just relaxing and going with the flow.  It's never come up before with other dating or relationships because I'm normally doing dating on days where I don't take my medication...   TL;DR **Date 1 went well without meds, Date 2 &amp; "3" didn't go as well while I was on medication... and I was moved on from.**
