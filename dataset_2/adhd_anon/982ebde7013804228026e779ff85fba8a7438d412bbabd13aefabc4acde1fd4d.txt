982ebde7013804228026e779ff85fba8a7438d412bbabd13aefabc4acde1fd4d;;;Mini "Life Pro Tip" regarding social skills. Possibly.;;;Ever read the book "how to win friends and influence people" ? The biggest tip in that book arguably is "be *genuinely* interested in others - it even goes so far as to say that feigning interest will do the *opposite* of "winning friends".  For me, this is an issue. I'm not sure if this is ADHD-related or not, but I really don't care about other peoples lives. I don't care to talk about mine, or hear about theirs. I have a hard time being genuinely interested in people, regardless of how much I like them.    I'm not an asshole, I swear. I'm very caring and love my friends to death, but I just...get bored.     Today, I have a meeting with someone who I definitely want to build good rapport with, so I was wondering how can I just for once be *interested* in someone. Truly.   So I invented a little game.    My goal today: Find out where he grew up.    How will I get this info?   *Creepyness*: Oh, you've been tattooing for 18 years? Was it always here? Where did you work before? Oh, did you grow up there?    I have a goal: find out where he grew up.    Maybe I shouldn't need these "games" to be interested in people, but maybe this will help. CBT has helped me a lot with other issues, and I feel this could work.   I really genuinely do want to know this now...for selfish reasons yes ("Win" my game) but...we'll see.    This is dumb.  [Maybe I'm just an asshole.](http://marcjohnsonbooks.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/8516admitting-you-re-an-asshole-pos.jpg)   Will report back.     **TLDR: Can I overcome my disinterest/boredom with every human being by setting a goal to find out a specific fact about them?**   Other tips would be appreciated!     *edit: didn't end up having the meeting. will try this next time it's relevant. i think it could work.*
