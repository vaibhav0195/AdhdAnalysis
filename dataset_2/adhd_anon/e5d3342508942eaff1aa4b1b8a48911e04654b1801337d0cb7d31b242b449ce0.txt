I'm 27/F and I was just recently diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder and have been taking a SSRI, which has helped with the anxiety, but I am starting to realize other problems. Some of these are: I've always gotten extremely interested in new hobbies (usually crafty things) and then abandoned them after a few days to a couple weeks, disorganization, reading multiple books at a time and never finishing them, not being motivated to do things even though I really want to (like picking up that towel or putting my clothes away), being distracted during conversations, being stressed about being late somewhere (the anxiety) and then being way early because I am terrible at guessing how long it should take to get there...all things I've seen mentioned here.  What I haven't seen mentioned here (sorry if it has) is an "out of sight, out of mind" mentality, which lead me to my ADHD research. One of my main annoyances is that if I put something in a closet...it is forgotten. I have to make an effort every once in a while to remind myself what's in the pantry. My plants and fish tank have to be in a room I am in a lot because if they weren't I would forget to feed/water them. So on and so forth. I know that this happens, which leads me to leave things out pretty much everywhere. This then makes me frustrated because I don't want to put it away because I'll forget it, but if I leave it out I hate how messy my apartment is but don't often have much motivation to clean it up.   Does anyone else have experience with this? Any tips on how to combat it?   Edit: I have an appointment this week with a new doc (had one appt. with a therapist who turned out to be out of network) and I'll be bringing up all these things.
