eacf8bec8c7a536e84e413a08a560649226e00f1d0291a81fdcf2e9f5d7ad0cd;;;Recently diagnosed with Unspecified ADHD after having a neuropsychological evaluation. Unsure how to handle this. (20, M);;;Some background, and I'm sorry for the wall of text.  I have a history of seizures that caused spells of aphasia (loss of ability to understand or express speech). This was caused by an undiagnosed brain tumor encapsulated by a cyst that pressed on my brain as it grew, causing the seizures. It was removed in 2009 (9th grade), but I had a major seizure (catatonic for several hours) eight days after the surgery. It took a while to get back to normal, but I continued school as normal.   I had a neuropsych eval in the January 2010. Results showed "significantly impaired sustained attention" and "slight weakness in performing math problems and in overall math performance." Counseling, school accommodations, regular sleep, and gathering information needed to develop a strategic plan for my future were recommendations post the evaluation. None of this happened.  I recently had a neuropsych eval because I brought up some things that had seemed normal for me all through high-school and college (falling asleep in class, daydreaming, inability to focus on more than one thing or activity at a time) after basically failing out of college this January.   I went back to the neuropsychologist Tuesday to go over the results. After the battery of tests, I have "unspecified ADHD." I was in denial/shock for a few days, but decided to come here and read some of the posts. It all fits.  Help? I'm supposed to go to a psychiatrist and talk to my neurologist about this, but I'd just like to hear from the community what this means or what I can do. How do I deal with this? It was always just, "Oh, that's TheGrimHero, he's just like that." It was normal.  :(
