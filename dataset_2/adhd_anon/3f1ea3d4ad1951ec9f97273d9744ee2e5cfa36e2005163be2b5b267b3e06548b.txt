Taking Strattera without having eaten causes me to completely break down. Feel dizzy, super tired. Taking it at night often has me waking up after a few hours with a racing heart or high blood pressure or something like that (I can't really identify for lack of comparison).  I now take 40mg twice a day because 60mg is too little and 80 at once basically knocked me out for 2 hours after taking it.  To avoid the side-effects I don't take the meds on time because I don't eat regularly enough (i.e. i took my last pill 12 hrs ago but I'm still in bed and haven't had breakfast so I'll have to wait until i've eaten which might still be another 2 hours...)  Anybody else experiencing this? Ideas what to do? My doctor is an unhelpful jerk.
