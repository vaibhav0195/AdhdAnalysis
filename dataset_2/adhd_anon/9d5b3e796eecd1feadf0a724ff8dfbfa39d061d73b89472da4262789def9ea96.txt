9d5b3e796eecd1feadf0a724ff8dfbfa39d061d73b89472da4262789def9ea96;;;ADHD success story;;;So I am 22 yo and was diagnosed this summer. Really opened my eyes to some extent.  Also learned about Meyers Briggs personality types (ENTP motherfuckers) and figured I was a gifted and quite unique soul after all.   Started taking concerta late autumn.  18-&gt;36-&gt;54mg. Like a cleaning duracell rabbit on crack.  Lowered back to 2x18mg (can adjust depending on what kind of day it is).   Started working out again, paired with nice forests walks and occationally jogging. Meditation, some spiritual shit and newfound insights later - I'm the very best I can be.   So. I remember when I read this sub a couple months ago and pitied the fuck out of both myself and you guys.  Don't.  Change is in your hands.  If something is deemed boring or uninteresting,  that's exactly what you need to do in order to challenge yourself and grow out of your own habits..   Btw, some 5000UI of vitamin D and Omega3 won't do you no harm either. You are all incredibly gifted people with talents that can help others. But first you gotta sort yourself out. So do that. Best of luck!
