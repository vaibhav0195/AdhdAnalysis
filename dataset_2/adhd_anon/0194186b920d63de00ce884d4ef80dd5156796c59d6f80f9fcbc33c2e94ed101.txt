What should I do?;;;Some background:  1. I pick things up, study them intently, and put them down somewhere around the house within 20 seconds. ALL THE TIME.  2. I run from place to place incessantly, even when it's not necessary at all.  3. I constantly get distracted by things like imperfections on a table, pens, pencils, windows etc. I can't concentrate on any one thing  4. On the subject of comorbidity, i have violent negative mood swings. Generally as a ridiculous overreaction to little niggling events.
