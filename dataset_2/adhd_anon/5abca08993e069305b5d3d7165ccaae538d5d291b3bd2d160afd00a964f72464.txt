5abca08993e069305b5d3d7165ccaae538d5d291b3bd2d160afd00a964f72464;;;The idea of an /r/ADHD IRC channel was briefly tossed around.  I  think it's a good idea.  Anyone interested?;;;With ThJ's [recent request](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/p85l1/hello_would_anybody_like_to_make_a_friend/) to make friends, it seems there's some interest in this community for a more real-time form of communication.  And as per bleep0000bloop's [comment thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/p85l1/hello_would_anybody_like_to_make_a_friend/c3nd9lz), it also appears that IRC may be favored by a portion of the userbase.  Is this something the community as a whole might be interested in?  Personally, I think it would be fantastic to have discussions in real-time with other people who experience similar issues.  And it's not like the channel has to be 100% ADHD all the time (unless of course the community deems it so?), but just a place for similar individuals to congregate and enjoy each others' company.  It looks like #adhd on freenode is already taken, and it's invite only.  I've currently got a bot holding #/r/adhd open, but am hesitant to register it with the chanserv until we get some pretty good support for the idea.  Mods: If this idea takes off, is this something we can stick in the side bar?  What's the process for getting this sanctioned and official?  Everyone: What do you say?  Suggestions?  Concerns?  **Edit:** We will probably want more than one channel op too, just in case something happens?  **Edit 2:**  Here's the info to connect, sorry guys, I should have included this originally:      Server: chat.freenode.net     Port: 6667     Channel: #/r/ADHD  Popular IRC clients include:  * [Pidgin](http://pidgin.im/) - Windows, Linux, OSX * [mIRC](http://www.mirc.com/) - Windows * [XChat](http://xchat.org/) - Windows, Linux (and possibly OSX?  I'm getting conflicting reports.) * [irssi](http://irssi.org/) - Linux * [weechat](http://www.weechat.org/) - Linux  There's a larger list [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_clients).

For some people, medication is often the only form of support sought after (for a variety of reasons), and so being active in or just reading the community here is *fantastic*!  This is an awesome win for everyone here :)  Keep it up guys, you all truly rock.  *** So here is your chance to **brag about ANYTHING you got done.** We ALL had wins both big and small. *You basically get free comment karma as well!*  **If you can't think of any "wins" you may need to rethink your definition of success** -- when I started, I counted ‘shower, eat breakfast, get ready, go outside EVERY day, go to sleep before 2 am for the last 6 days....”  **The point is to focus on how YOU won, and did not let your ADHD win.**  =)  *** Some examples from past weeks  ☺ **Started taking ADHD medication**  ☺ **Called doctor** to set up an appointment x4  ☺ **Working out** and eating a healthy diet  ☺ Got to work...**on time**!  ☺ Went to **sleep by 2AM** for 6 nights  ☺ FINALLY GOT A **DIAGNOSIS** (a few people) **VERY AWESOME**  ☺ Started **working out** again  ☺ Made the first call towards getting diagnosed (got a referral) or made my first appointment.  *** By sharing our wins every Wednesday...**I hope you will start to be on the lookout for the positive things you do each week. You will start to gain awareness and see that everything isn't all bad!** *This MIGHT even become a routine as you excitedly log on every Wednesday night to share.*
5abca08993e069305b5d3d7165ccaae538d5d291b3bd2d160afd00a964f72464;;;Let's get ready to [Kick-Start Sunday]!;;;  **/r/ADHD it's time for [Kick-Start Sunday] -- guaranteed accomplishments if you actively participate!**  Kick-Start Sunday is where [/r/adhd](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/) shares the goals, tasks, or habits we want to accomplish this week.  You will be held gently accountable (which is a good thing!) and we can check in with you...helping YOU get things done.  *I suggest you read the whole post to be MORE successful, so put in the little extra initial effort and continue reading....*  *** ## Choose the participation method that works for you: * **Most important task** - Share one (or a couple) **HIGH-PRIORITY** tasks that you really would like to finally finish.  *(Ex. Set a doctors appointment, finish assignment, clean the kitchen...whatever YOU think is most important.)* * **Make a list** - Post a list of all the things you want to accomplish this week.  *(I highly recommend identifying the top 3 priorities.)* * **Feed your soul** - Sometimes by relaxing and having fun we have more energy to get more done. **List a couple FUN items to make your list more exciting.**  **Need/Want to copy last week's list *verbatim*?  Absolutely DO SO!**  *Those might be your keystone habits. Once you start doing those regularly you are able to do more. soon they will be automatic and you can put your focus elsewhere.*  *** By sharing our goal(s) with this understanding community, we can keep each other **accountable**...and **celebrate our successes**, large or small!  **Don’t forget to return for [Win Wedenesday] to flaunt your successes!**  ;-)  By getting one small task done it creates **momentum**, **trust** in yourself, **confidence**, and you will feel like doing more.  *** ## Suggested Guidelines * **Prioritize your list.** One thing you want to get done (or start). What is the most important thing for you? (If making a list works best for you feel free to do that too!) * **Add a finish OR start deadline.** By committing to a date/time, we can check on your progress. * **Edit your comment when done.** - Come back and edit your comment when you have finished your goal. We can celebrate that (and then people won't check on you). * **Small start.** - Share what SMALL (under 10 minutes) commitment you can make towards your goal.  *I found when my clients didn’t reach their goals 90% of the time they never started...this will help you break through the initial barrier.*  *** ## Tips * Your tasks/goals should ideally be S.M.A.R.T goals: **Specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound** * **Measurable** - Make sure you can be able to say YES I DID THIS. **Study enough** is not measurable.  Study 2 hours is. * **Break it down** - Instead of saying clean my room...it might help to say, “Clean room for 10 minutes or pick up trash in room.” * **Write it down elsewhere** - Sticky note by computer.  Google calendar.  Agenda.  Write it down so you don't forget.  Our working memories are flaky.... * **Start small...build up slowly** - We want to build on small successes so committing to cleaning your entire house might be a bit too much to handle.  Pick a room (or a task like ‘pick up dirty laundry’)  instead. * **Want to study for 2 hours a day?** *Commit to studying 30 minutes to make it easier on you.*  *** ## Examples from previous weeks: * Wash clothes. * Finish my math class early.  **Done!** * Eat! * Run 2k. * Apply for ONE job. * Send rent. * Remember passport, ticket, etc. for trip. * **Start** *[something]*. “Spend 5 minutes on writing my paper.” * List unneeded items for sale on eBay, CL, etc. * Floss * Clean my room to see the floor.  *** ## *It’s now easier to respond!  Just copy/paste the below into your comment.*      ## Daily Habit / Procrastinated Project / Soul-Feeding     * **What?** -     * **How much time?** -     * **When?** -     * **Potential Obstacles?** -     * **Check in on me? When?** -     * **Small Start** -     * **Reward** -     * **Something fun you want to do this week** -     * **Daily Habit** -  *** Daily list template, if that suits you better.      ## Monday --       * Item     ## Tuesday --     ## Wednesday --     ## Thursday --     ## Friday --     ## Saturday --       ## Sunday --  *** Don’t forget to **brag about your accomplishments in Win Wednesday** on Wednesday.  **Celebrating/acknowledging your wins is just as important as actually getting stuff done.**  *** **TL,DR: Share what you want to accomplish this week and how you will do it. Having people check on you via Reddit is extremely helpful!**

Plan out just one thing to do for each day of the week! ;;;### You can read every thread on /r/ADHD and KNOW what you need to do, but not know HOW to do it. KSS is the part where you take action and apply what you learned.  #### Plan just one thing for each day.   We are often paralyzed when we have a lot on our plate because we don’t know exactly how or where to start. Think about just one thing to do for each day.   *An example:*  *** # Monday  * Clean toilet   # Tuesday  * Take out trash   # Wednesday  * Brush the cat   # Thursday  * Take bike to shop   # Friday  * Dust the tv room   *** ##### No-karma self-post -- upvote for visibility please!  *** *Alternately, [formatting options for a more standard KSS](http://redd.it/uit9x).*

Establish a new, fix up an old, spice up an existing.  ;;;Lots of us have a hard time getting up in the morning, or doing what we need to do in the morning to get out the door in a timely fashion.  #### Let's work on our morning routines this week!  Simple things like:  * Put on all of my clothes (including shoes) before I do my hair, that way I can just pick up and go if I realize I'm running late.    * This one has actually helped me a lot.  Before, I'd spend a lot of time making my hair look right, but I didn't have my shoes on!  Then I'd realize I was running late and I'd still have to do the basics and then I'd miss my train.  * Segregate blocks of time for like activities    * In my bag I have a tablet, a bluetooth keyboard, a sweater, my screwdriver kit, and a pair of headphones.  Before, I'd be running around packing this stuff up while also getting dressed, brushing my teeth, feeding the cat, etc.  Lumping these activities together has saved time and resulted in a more organized morning.  * If you take public transit and have a smart phone or active computer, make it a habit to check the times until the next bus/train comes to your stop.   * This one is dangerous, so be careful.  I've often found myself checking the next train time on my phone only to be sucked into facebook or reddit or the chatroom.  But by checking how much time remains until my next train, I have a keen idea of when I need to be out of the door and what I can still do before I head out.  _Not all of these will apply to everyone of course, but these are just a few that I have found useful for my mornings!_  Share what has worked for you to inspire others, tweak existing routines to be more efficient, come up with brand new things to do if you find yourself with some free time!  If you want, break down your morning from when you wake up until you have to walk out of the door and assign activities to specific blocks of time based on _realistic_ predictions of how long each activity will take.  ### Keep an eye on the clock throughout each morning.  The best way to gain a sense of time, a sense of how long things take, is to look at the clock before and after (and maybe during).
