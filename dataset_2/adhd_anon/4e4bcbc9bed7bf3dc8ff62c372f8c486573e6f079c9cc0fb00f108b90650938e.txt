Over a week has gone by and both of us have forgotten to pick up tape. Today, I realized we both had been clever and ordered it from Amazon when two boxes of packing tape arrived, one addressed to each of us. On the plus side, we probably won't run out for a while.   photo of packing tape: http://imgur.com/FnVR9PW  edit: in case I wasn't clear, the funny part is both of us forgetting for almost two weeks and then ordering it on the same day &amp; forgetting to tell each other. I wish I could say this is the first time something like this has happened!
