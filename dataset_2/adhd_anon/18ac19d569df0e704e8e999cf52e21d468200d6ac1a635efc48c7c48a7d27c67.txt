I was diagnosed with ADD/ADHD (which may or may not have actually been true) when I was really young. So, like probably many of you guys on here, I spent my childhood on ADD drugs- first Ritalin, then Adderall. There were a couple weeks on Dexedrine too, but I don't talk about those because I have no memory of them whatsoever. (Kind of why I went off that one. Anyway.) I finally dropped them when I got into college, and in that one year I discovered an almost infinite appetite. In nine months I gained thirty pounds, and I haven't been skinny since. Now, I know stimulants like Ritalin and Adderall can act as appetite suppressants. My question is this- DAE have a similar story? Spend your youth marinated in amphetamines and get fat when you stop? Information on the subject is sorely lacking thus far.  If you did get fat, what other circumstances surrounded your stopping the medicine? For me, it was something like depression- which makes my own data at least somewhat suspect.  If you didn't, what circumstances surrounded THAT? I need both sides of the story here.  I know it's crude methodology at best, but I'm curious to see if my hypothesis even has a leg to stand on or if I'm just tilting at windmills.
