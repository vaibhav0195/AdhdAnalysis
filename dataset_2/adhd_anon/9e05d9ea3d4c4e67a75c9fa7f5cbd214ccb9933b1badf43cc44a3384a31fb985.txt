I want tips to get over it not avoid it with my adderall and a shit ton of caffeine. All my friends can get over it fast and there has to be a way that people with adhd can break that mental wall too.   Edit: I do take my meds. I have to study later in the evening so I can't take my medication then. Even if it is an Instant release I can't take it past 4 and get to bed at a reasonable time.
