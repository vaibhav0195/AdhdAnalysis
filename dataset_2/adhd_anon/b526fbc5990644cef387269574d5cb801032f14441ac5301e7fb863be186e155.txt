b526fbc5990644cef387269574d5cb801032f14441ac5301e7fb863be186e155;;;ADHD and medical marijuana;;;I have been diagnosed with ADHD for 3 weeks now, i'm on a 60mg dose of vyvanse currently(Started at 20mg). I have lost alot of weight due to the side effects of the pill. I have also not been able to get to sleep and have very odd vivid dreams of shadow people. I'm only 15 and i wanted to see if i would be eligible for a green card in Arizona, my mom is very worried about my weight loss and trouble sleeping. I cant think of other options beside mmj. Im talking about the use if mmj for my side effects (Not sleeping/eating) not for my ADHD.
