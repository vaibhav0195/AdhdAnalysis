I've (20 y/o female) always had hobbies and interests but as far as careers go, I've always wanted to work in medicine and ultimately become a surgeon, a passion nurtured my entire life by both of my parents who work in the medical field. I've always been a successful student, graduated high school with near a 4.5 GPA. My senior year of high school I broke--struggling with crippling depression for a few years my symptoms soon turned to those of ADD and I was formally diagnosed. Then I graduated high school, got accepted to all the universities I applied to, got settled into college in the fall and everything was fine, until my grades started to tank and my ADD seemed to take over every aspect of my life at all moments of the day. I sought treatment, was put on Adderall, but that can only do so much. After semester and semester of failure I started to accept the fact that there's no way I can succeed in med school if ADD has stunted my academic career already to this extent. I have taken a little over 1 year from school off to reevaluate my life and figure out what I want to do and still, my passion is there. I'm now looking back into med school and looking to finalize everything I need to in order to register for classes and complete my undergraduate degree. I was wondering if anyone had any tips or advice to help me cope from here on out, to prevent my past mistakes from happening again and keep my ADD and anxiety at bay. Any insight at all is highly appreciated! Thank you for reading!  **TL;DR**: Does anyone have any advice on how to succeed on the road before/during medical school with also dealing with ADD/anxiety?
