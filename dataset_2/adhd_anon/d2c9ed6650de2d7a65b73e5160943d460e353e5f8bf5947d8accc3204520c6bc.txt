d2c9ed6650de2d7a65b73e5160943d460e353e5f8bf5947d8accc3204520c6bc;;;Got my appointment at an ADHD center on the 8th April after being referred.;;;I was given a small test by my GP, and he gave something called a "Preliminary diagnosis", and he referred me to an Adult ADHD center in the UK. I was sent forms for myself, my girlfriend and my parents to complete, which I sent back.  I just got a letter stating that on the 8th of April I am to go for a 2.5 hour meeting, but I am able to bring someone with me.  I am hoping to bring my girlfriend, but don't know why. What do you think this meeting will be about/what will happen (2 and a half hours is a REALLY long time.....)  TL;DR Have a 2.5 hour meeting with an Adult ADHD specialist - what to expect? Should I bring someone?
