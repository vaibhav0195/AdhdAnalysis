I was diagnosed with ADHD last month and started concerta (18mg) 4 days ago. I have been a semi heavy marijuana smoker for the past 3 years and I have not smoked since starting my medication. I have been noticing some side effects and I'm not sure if it is marijuana withdrawal or side effects from the concerta. I feel dehydrated, despite drinking tons of water, irritable, a little nauseous and kind of anxious. The concerta has helped with my focus and attention but my mind has been feeling kind of blank. I have 10 days left on my prescription before I see my doc again. My question is, have any marijuana smokers who have started meds experienced anything like this? I cannot get into my doc any earlier as he has no appointments available. Any insight would be great!
