b364ce436c8eb9d3e512d44397f05b587fb37fa0f625792774f4cdd405f5d3d0;;;Continuation: How I Became a Happier and More Productive Man After an ADHD Diagnosis at The Age of 27;;;Hello,    I have gotten some questions regarding my [previous post](https://redd.it/4n9uou) and will try to provide more information here.     **My intention for writing this post is to help others by sharing how I've come to manage my ADHD and Social Anxiety the last couple of months. I don't claim to be right or know all the answers. This is a learning process for us all. Hopefully this post paves the way for intelligent discussions on how we can all learn to manage our symptoms better.**    ##Medication - I started taking medication a year ago and finally reached a stable dosage after five months. I am currently taking Vyvanse. I was honest with my Psychiatrist when I noticed that the FDA dosage limit was insufficient for me. She was understanding and provided me the appropriate dose. **Medication is the foundation of my ADHD treatment, but it’s only the start. Medication is a tool that allows me to focus, which helps me become aware of myself, which helps me direct my focus on my priorities and interactions.** - It's challenging, but possible to live without medication. After reading the first couple pages of "In Search of Lost Time" by Marcel Proust, you can experience what I believe to be his ADHD symptoms. He wrote one of the best literary works of art, but went to great lengths to remove distractions - i.e., nailing cork board around his entire room to muffle out distractions.    ##Health: Moderate Alcohol, Sugar, and Caffeine Intake - **I do not drink alcohol and I refrain from sugary drinks and caffeine.** I am human and have the capacity to enjoy pleasures, but I force myself to remember the effects of pleasures like drinking alcohol or sugary drinks. **One cocktail can negatively impact my focus for a week.**   - I do enjoy an afternoon tea and biscuit, but I have to be conscious of the amount of sugar I am consuming and be aware that my focus, actions, and decisions can be impacted by the effects of sugar.  - **I drink tons of water, but grab a gatorade whenever I feel unusually dehydrated.**  - **Visine is a must for me. My eyes tend to dry up often. I carry a small bottle in my office bag and keep a spare at home. I have 20/20 vision, but was able to get a prescription for reading glasses to prevent my eyes from straining after hours of reading.**   ##Food: Crucial for the ADHD Mind - Vyvanse suppresses my appetite and have learned to be very cautious with my food intake. **I found that routine works best.** Just like your mind, your body will adjust.   - **Protein is a must. It provides a steady source of energy.**   - **In terms of calories, I try to split my meals with 50% of the calories consisting of protein and 50% consisting of carbs. Chicken, fish, brown rice, quinoa, oatmeal, potatoes, etc.** Again, your body will adjust.    - **My usual day consists of:**   - **7am:  ~a cup of cooked oatmeal** (Two packets of the lower sugar instant oatmeal, or a packet and a half of the 10g protein oatmeal.)   - **11am: ~a chicken breast and ~2 cups of brown rice** (I honestly go to the same restaurant, at the same time, and order the same food every day.)   - **6pm: ~40 grams of protein and ~2 cups of brown rice or quinoa**  - I’m a small guy and currently only swim on Saturdays, so I usually consume 1,500 calories a day.   - When I notice my blood sugar drop in the late afternoon, I grab a small bite at a coffee shop or I'll have a Soylent (I keep a stash at work).   - **The body will adjust if you train it to only eat when it is time to eat.** I believe the French follow this belief. This mentality allows me to focus on my priorities until the time rolls by to eat.   - My boyfriend is well aware of how food also affects my mood and executive function, so he prepares me food when my blood sugar is obviously low (when I show signs of frustration/irritation). **I’ve explained to him that decisions become extremely difficult when my blood sugar is low, so he needs to take the lead for me during those times because I won't be in the right state of mind.**   ##The ADHD Mind: Conquering Your Mind Requires Patience and Persistence  - **The ADHD mind is a wild beast that must be tamed. To tame the mind, we must first become aware of our mind and constantly be on guard. The experience of restlessness, disrupted sleep, impulsivity, anxiety are all things unconsciously created by our minds. Since our minds create these experiences, we have the capacity to control our mind and do away with our restlessness, disrupted sleep, impulsivity, and anxiety.** I achieved this by being mindful, daily meditation, Stoic philosophy, and by constantly bringing my focus back to the present.  - **I grew up in a home full of people with ADHD, bipolar, and schizophrenia - all undiagnosed. I viewed and lived with the belief that the symptoms listed above were normal. I now believe that these emotions disrupt our lives because of a lack of mental discipline. Through a lot of hard work and mental effort, we can learn to slow down our minds.** I am now able to feel my anxiety as it arises. When it does, I say “this is anxiety.” and return my focus to my task at hand. Lingering on that feeling or emotion removes my focus from the task at hand and only worsens the anxiety. **The ADHD mind finds stimulation by feeling these disruptive emotions. We must discipline ourselves on how to prevent these emotions from taking over our life.**   ##The Sleep Paradox - I prefer a **cool, dark, and quiet bedroom.** My mind is always on, so any noise or light will prevent me from falling asleep. I use a blind fold and ear plugs. **I have always suffered from insomnia, but lately I have been able to fall in a deep sleep within a minute by calming my mind.** I find my comfortable position and focus on my breathing.  - I’ve noticed that **my ADHD symptoms are worse if I get 8 hours of sleep,** so I force myself to sleep no more than 7 hours. I created repeating calendar events on my phone to remind me when to shut off screens, when to start my night routine, and when to head to bed. I could work until 2am if I don’t set a reminder.    ##Attention: The Latin Origin of the Word - When we think of the meaning of attention, what comes to mind? I recently found out that the word **‘attention’ comes from the latin word ’attendere’ which means to “stretch/turn toward.” It’s as if the Romans wanted to convey the effort required to pay attention.** And the Latin word for “to notice” something is literally “to turn one’s mind.”  - **Attention requires effort, but most that effort revolves around conquering our distractions.**   ##Academic Journals - I don’t have a particular preference, but have been able to find some good material on Jstor. Reading academic journals might not sound exciting to many, but look for things that interest you. **I find reading on ADHD symptoms interesting because it helps me discover how my mind works and how I can better manage it.**   ##Talk Therapy - I highly recommend talk therapy to those who need more guidance. Personally, I have found it difficult to find a good therapist. I have a very generous insurance plan and it was still a challenge. My boyfriend currently sees a private therapist, so that is a possibility. Honestly, **I found reading academic journals and listening to academics more beneficial than therapy.**  - **I would never discourage anyone from seeking talk therapy. Try it for a couple months and see how things go.** - Neuropsychologist Evenlyn Miccio at Kaiser Permanente in San Francisco is an amazing person. She does a lot of work on ADHD and loves talking about it. [She gives weekly workshops in SF.](https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/ncal/provider/evelynmiccio/about/professional?ctab=About+Me&amp;to=1) - **Neuroscientist Nora Volkow has also done impressive research on ADHD, dopamine, and addiction.**    ##Reflect and Learn from Past Experiences. Learn From the Experiences of Others, Too. - **Pay attention to people that you admire and identify their key traits.** My company's CEO is a complete bad ass. **She is always calm, friendly, rational, and an amazing speaker.** - My boyfriend and co-workers thought it would be weird, but I typed up a list of questions that I wanted to ask the CEO and **sent her an email expressing my desire to interview her. I attached the list of questions as a symbolic gesture that I was prepared and would not waste her time.** Of course, I had to make sure that my email and attachment were free of errors and formatting was spot on. (If you plan on emailing your CEO, make sure you read the business writing book listed below.) - **I learned a great deal from the CEO in those 30 minutes. I could not believe how insightful and honest she was.** - The CEO had gotten her Bachelor's in Philosophy, so **she was a great fan of the Stoics** and was well aware of how she embodied Stoic principles. I'll have to create a different post on the advice she passed down to me.  - [Get the Most Out of Informational Interviews from HBR](https://hbr.org/2016/02/how-to-get-the-most-out-of-an-informational-interview)    ##Improve Your Communication: Take a Business Writing Course (or Read HBR's Guide to Better Business Writing) - **Just like a tidy and organized workspace puts us in a better mood, I believe that mindful writing does the same.** - **Business writing helps me focus on the message I want to say, and helps me say it in the clearest and most concise way possible.** Perfect for those ADHD and great for those without ADHD. - It helps you, the writer, to carefully consider your audience. **Business writing allows you to present the information in a format that is easily understood in the quickest way possible.**  - My posts have been organized (to the best of my ability) in a business writing format to help those with ADHD to easily navigate the information. If business writing helps those with ADHD, imagine how much more effective your writing would be for all your readers.     ##Videos **I.
