My doctor prescribed me 10mg Adderall XR and suggested I try taking one at first, and two if need be.  Now I've been taking one 10mg in the morning, and the second in the afternoon because I feel that works best.  However, my doctor told me that adderall is designed to be taken once a day and suggested I take 2 x 10mg at once.  Is this something of concern?  Does spacing out the dosage even make a difference?  I feel uncomfortable that taking such a large dosage (for my body size) may have unforeseeable consequences and I rather remain in control by spacing out my dosage.  Thanks in advance -- I've been a longtime lurker in this community and just wanted to chime in on how supportive this sub is.
