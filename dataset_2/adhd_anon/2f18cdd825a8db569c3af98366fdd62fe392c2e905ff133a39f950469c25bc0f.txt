Any suggestions?;;;Reddit, I have been taking conerta (54mg) for a few months now, works great for me. But there is 1 downside: I really have problems with eating during the day. I have to force myself to cram something in my mouth during lunch. Which makes me feel almost sick from hunger during the day, I know i have to eat, but I just can't. It's like my body won't let me. Does anyone have the same problem, and/or a suggestion on what might help me?
