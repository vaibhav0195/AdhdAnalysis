809301d13ae94f9580293777b5b069ae8b2ac7313ab863b266559806fa35b2f1;;;I just wanted to introduce myself, I think I will be hanging out here a lot in the future.;;;I am 32, male, a high school dropout, recovering drug addict (almost 6 years clean), and am diagnosed ADHD.      My only experience with ADHD meds was ritalin for about 2 months 12 years ago. I was drinking and smoking weed heavily at the time. I stopped taking them because I felt like sometimes they were making me better, and sometimes worse. In hindsight I realize that there was no way they could have worked when I could not administer them properly. I kind of told myself then that I didn't need to take meds to be normal. I think I was scared of the stigma, and I was in denial of the problem.      Ten years later I have conquered my battle with drug abuse but my life is that of a typical adult with untreated ADHD. I have piles of stuff everywhere, I am always late paying bills, I don't get anything done, I have 300 unfinished projects, I have trouble in crowds etc.     I have recently had a moment of clarity, where I realized all my problems in life are really only one big problem. I need to treat my ADHD. I will be put on my girlfriends medical insurance at the end of june and plan on seeking professional treatment then. Between now and then I plan on self educating and trying non medical solutions.      This is what I have so far: exercise daily, use my day planner, take l-tyrosine fish oil and a multivitamin, meditate, establish healthy sleep patterns. I know I am missing some key peices to the puzzle, what should I add?      **TL;DR  Hi. I am finally going to get hel....oh look a fire truck!**
