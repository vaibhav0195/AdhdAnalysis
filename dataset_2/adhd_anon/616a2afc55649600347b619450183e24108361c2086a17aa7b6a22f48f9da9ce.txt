I was undiagnosed at the time and my semesters were always a mess: was late on almost every essay, and struggled to do the workload; most assignments that weren't late were done at midnight or the morning after. I was diagnosed after college, and I'm rehabilitating from a year long injury to my back (Slipped disk, currently learning to bend my back now). I've had sparse writing gigs in the mean time, but they were always a mess.   **Event at hand** Last night I had a soccer match report to write up, and sent it in at 4 a.m., when it should've been done at midnight, 3 a.m. the latest. The editor is pretty fed up with me, he had a backup writer just in case. He emailed me saying that despite being talented, I'm unreliable, that I should think things over; if my ability to turn in work on time is such a hindrance we should part ways.  **Question to you all** I think despite any talent or ability to write, that maybe I should think about a career change. Writing requires a lot of skills which I don't seem to be suited for: I'm not able to work within a timeframe, I'm bad at scheduling, I'm not able to learn from my mistakes fast enough, etc. Are there any reddit users that are writers, or in a similar freelance position? Jobs in which you have to schedule your own projects and meet deadlines? (kind of broad and applicable to everyone I guess) How have you dealt with the demands of your job despite your ADHD?  **My thoughts on the situation and the future** I'd like to make a concerted effort to rebuild my life (for the umpteenth time), but I'm at a point where getting out of bed and taking my medicine is one of the hardest things to do (partly because of the back pain). For a more concrete idea of my life: I wake up at 9, I'm probably dressed and have eaten by 12, then I read about 20-25 pages of Game of Thrones an hour (I'm aiming for 50-80 a day), play guitar for an hour, play FIFA until it gets late-ish, go to sleep, repeat.  **My life questions I'm pondering** My low self-esteem and my current lifestyle productivity have me wondering if I should aim for something lower and in a different career, maybe just like a Starbucks Barista for awhile? Or should I take more time off and try to rebuild myself (kind of against it, lack of deadlines, the open and free time)   **Conclusion** I think maybe I need a more monotonous job. I won't be caught day dreaming while trying to think of how to think of introductions or researching information.  **TL;DR:** Not good at writing because of ADHD. Time to do something else?
