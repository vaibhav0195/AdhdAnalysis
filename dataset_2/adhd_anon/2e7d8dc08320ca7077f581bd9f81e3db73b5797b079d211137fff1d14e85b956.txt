I see it everywhere, even more than the usual CBT, and apparently it helps them sooooo much. But i can't do it, it's dreadfully boring and incredibly hard. I don't feel anything, no equanimity ([Learned that word from this post, very helpful](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/4n9uou/how_i_became_a_happier_and_more_productive_man/)). No level ups or anything visual like that. What is the fucking point? It's really frustrating, i can't do something that will help me, but isn't that ADHD in a nutshell?   What do i do. I don't wanna miss out on this thing.
