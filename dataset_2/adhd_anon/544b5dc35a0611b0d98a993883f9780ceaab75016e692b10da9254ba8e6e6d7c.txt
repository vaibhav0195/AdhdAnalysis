I always had poor grades up until I was diagnosed by my p-doc with ADHD prior to law school. I've been off and on adderall/vyvanse/lexapro/wellbutrin for the past three years and my social life doesn't exist anymore.   I tried to exercise and stay off all meds and found my depression to be overwhelming. I still live at home because I can't afford to move out, but I wonder if my surroundings is what makes me feel this bad. Just need some advice for long-term treatment options please, thank you.
