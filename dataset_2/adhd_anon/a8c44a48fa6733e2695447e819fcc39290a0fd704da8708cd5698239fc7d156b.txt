Lately I've been finding myself distracted again even while on my meds. I've only just know abou my condition since probably the 3rd or 4th semester of college. My doctor pulled the ole tske these and you'll be fine routine. I'm at a loss at how to organize my life. The balancing act has become too difficult to manage and I'm looking for some advice from people who have dealt with this longer. Now I've most likely had ADHD for a while and it's gone undiagnosed , but now that I know I have it want to manage it proper. Is there anything that you find particularly helpful for managing daily tasks? I've tried sticky notes, app, personal planner, etc. With not much luck. How do you manage? Also since my diagnosis I find that I have sleep paraysis as well.
