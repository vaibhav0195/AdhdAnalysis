e6ae9d40f6c9ef93d20b049633efd54ffcccbb5b9059184401df9a6209217d2b;;;are all my other problems actually stemming from ADHD?;;;so i'm a 27y/o guy. i've been dealing with moderate-to-severe anxiety since i was 14 with brief breaks that were probably related to self-medicating with drugs and booze. smoking pot worked for a few years, drinking worked for a few years, now i take lexapro (prescription) and it totally helps... with anxiety. but, a lot of the major symptoms that i and my doctor attributed to anxiety are actually getting worse- like: - i can't focus on ANYTHING, which is not good since my job is being a music producer- (no, i'm not famous whatsoever, but have managed to at least make that my main source of income for several years with random temp jobs to supplement when needed...)... i can't pay attention to the tracks i get sent or the ones i am supposed to be making. its not like i don't want to work on them, i just open them and stare blankly at the program and space out then close the session to "come back to it later."   - i forget shit all of the time (my memory has never been stellar, but its getting worse and worse)  - i still have "brain fog" to some degree, but its less panic-ridden than it was before the anxiety meds.  - i can just sit and space out thinking about one random tangent after another all day but can't bring myself to do anything... i don't feel depressed, just like i am operating at half-speed and super indifferent even though part of me is like "dude get off your ass."   recently i was discussing this with a group of people and someone mentioned that my symptoms sounded like adult ADD. after doing some research, i am considering that as a possibility. what do you guys think? any advice would be greatly appreciated.
