Since her birthday is 9 days past the cut off date for kindergarten, she did not start school this year. This ended up being a blessing as it gives me another year to work with her. She is highly intelligent (she is teaching herself to read) and quite the handful. She sees a therapist once a week and right now we are working on getting a handle of her ODD. The place she goes to is awesome as they believe medicating kids is a last resort. This means she is not taking any meds at this point in time, but it might change if she is still having major issues come starting school next year. Right now I am a stay at home mom who really should go back to work, but with everything going on with my daughter I'm really hesistant. The rest of our family includes her dad, a 17 year old brother, a 15 year old sister (both whom have a different dad), and my mom.  The main objective of my post is to get advice from those of you who have any or all of the above and those of you who are parents. I've read that keeping a strict schedule for them really helps out ... which is something really hard for me because I am not an organized person by any means. Things that have worked (or even not worked) for you will be much appreciated.
