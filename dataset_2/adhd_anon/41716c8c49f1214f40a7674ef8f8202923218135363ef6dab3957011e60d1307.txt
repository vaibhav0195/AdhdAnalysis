I'm nervous, guys, can you help prepare me?;;;Been through some therapy, talked to counselors, had a neuropsych eval about two years ago. I've been diagnosed with moderate-severe depression. I can't hold a straight thought together, I forget where I put things, even after five minutes of setting them aside. I feel like I'm trapped in my own head 90% of the time and I'm missing most of my life - or fucking it up by being inattentive and out of it.   I'm being tested on the 17th. What can I expect? Is there anything I need to do? Anti-depressants made me incredibly violent and emotional, what can I expect from ADHD meds if I do end up on them?   I'm pretty freaked out. I guess that's stupid, but I don't know what I'm getting myself into. My brother and my mom both have ADHD, so I don't know if that's useful to know.   *tl;dr* Given run around by mental health professionals, getting tested for ADHD, not sure what to expect if I do have it. Halp.

I just now (at 28) had someone look at my chart and symptoms and instead of prescribing me anti-anxiety and anti-depressant medication went, "Oh. Here, try some Ritalin instead." Before I was on Lexapro and Wellbutrin and felt *horrible* and have been through a song and dance of different medications that have mostly made me feel like crap. **The excuse my ex-psych gave me for not prescribing stimulants was that they made autistic people "aggressive and violent" and made anxiety far worse.**   **Turns out it's the total opposite.** I am far, far less irritable, more patient and calm, and face challenges or hangups way more easily instead of just getting frustrated and giving up. I have virtually no anxiety now.  The last three days really have been incredible. **I've gotten so much work done**, caught up on my sculpting commissions, drawn more than I've drawn in the past six months in the last three days and generally have just been creating my brains out. It's incredible. I finally have the capacity and drive to just do the things I want or need to. Store? No problem. Laundry? Done. Writing? PAGES. **This is important because I make my living through art and I've been at a standstill for ages.**  **I am so scared this will go away.** I'm scared that the medication will stop working at some point or that this is just a "honeymoon" period and next week I'll be back to endlessly cycling between reddit and Facebook in a totally unproductive haze. It's like **Flowers for Algernon**; what if I just go back to the way I used to be? What if this is only temporary. I've had periods of burst creativity fade into nothing before.   **tl;dr** Finally got medication (combination of 20mg Ritalin and 300mg Wellbutrin) after 4 years. Scared my productivity, self-discipline and creativity will go away again and leave me miserable and anxious because I can't create anything. Halp.
