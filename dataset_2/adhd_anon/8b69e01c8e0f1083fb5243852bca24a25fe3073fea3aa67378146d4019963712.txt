8b69e01c8e0f1083fb5243852bca24a25fe3073fea3aa67378146d4019963712;;;saw this on facebook and had to ask if other fellow redditors think this is right;;;so yeah. here's me scrolling along facebook when i come across this picture. made me wonder if anyone else with adhd is skinny, no matter WHAT they do haha. like i eat a shit load of food and gain no weight. got me wondering if a normal person's brain uses 20 to 30% of the calories, then how much does an adhd brain use. cause i know all you fellow adhd'ers feel the same as me. how it feels like your brain is constantly running a million miles per second on every topic you could imagine. therefor using more calories, therefor making us skinny   TL;DR its not that long read it, are fellow adhd'ers skinny
