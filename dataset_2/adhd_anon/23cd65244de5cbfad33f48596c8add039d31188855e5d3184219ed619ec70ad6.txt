This started since before that however, when I am on my own or I'm not listening to anything like music or a tv I feel like the voice in my head is screaming, like I'm being told off but I don't know what it's saying, it makes me feel nervous and so I have to put something on to take the focus away and that usually stops it. It still happens now, not all the time, usually around midday and I'm not really doing anything.   Also I'm not sure if this is related but when I go out and drink sometimes when I come home and go to bed I feel very clearly like everyone i went out with that night is in my room partying, so I wake up to join them and it goes away and obviously no one is there. It's like a lucid dream where I feel like I'm sleeping but I can hear everything going on around me.  Is this an ADHD thing, does anyone else feel like this too?
