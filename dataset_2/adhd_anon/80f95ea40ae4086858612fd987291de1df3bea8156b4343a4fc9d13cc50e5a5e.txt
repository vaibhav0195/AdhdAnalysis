Since then I have been on three different medications (five if you include the Ritalin I took as a test for a few days and the Dexedrine I take to help tide me over when my meds run out.) I've heard things like "you'll know when you get the right med" ect. So I'd like to hear from someone in the community what it feels like to have a working drug.  TLDR: How do you know when you are on the correct meds?
