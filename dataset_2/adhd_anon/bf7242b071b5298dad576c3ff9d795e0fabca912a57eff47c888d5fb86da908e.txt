I don't know why I said that to myself because when I thought about it I realized that I have made so many changes ever since I started Adderall my life is completely different since I started. I've become a totally different person and have improved in almost every way I can think of but it still feels like it's not enough and that I have barely accomplished much. Just shows that we really do crave change and it feels as though there has the be a huge change all at once. Instead of wanting a huge change though I realized that it's not one huge change that is gonna happen. it's all tiny changes that will add up to a huge change
