599550e8a7381c3d43c0c84765e94dfa72fd489ddabc74d4cb8646cc67395978;;;My ADHD makes me a sucky driver and it depresses me;;;I need my meds (Vyvanse) to be able to drive well. I'm not an awful driver by any means, I've never been in an accident. It's just that without my meds I can't do it well.  When I take my meds I have an internal thought process going on of like "Okay I just got on this road is my next turn going to be a left or a right? Left. Okay I should start working on merging into that lane." I feel in control and I'm a really good driver at controlling the car and my speed and being aware.   When I don't take my meds, I can't do this. I forget about merging until it's too late and I get frustrated and can't seem to take in what I see in my mirrors unless I stare. Which isn't good when you're on a highway.   The good thing is, I can identify that I need my meds to drive. And I can take them when I have to drive. Bad thing is it takes 30-45 minutes for them to kick in. I don't take my meds daily- only on days with classes and/or work. So if I have somewhere to go last minute I can't just pop one and go.   The thing about this is it just makes me so upset and feel like I'm so out of control. My boyfriend is always telling me things when we drive (not necessarily in a mean way, just like "Hey you're too close to that car") and it makes me want to cry. I try to explain it as like, it's when you are trying to move furniture and you just can't pick something up and you're just absolutely physically unable to do it. And he understands, but he still tells me things to keep us both safe. Which I understand. But it just reinforces my own insecurities I have about me driving. How can I cope with this?  tl;dr I'm not an awful driver, but without my meds I'm sucky. It makes me feel out of control and makes me really upset. How can I cope with this?
