Help!;;;My question is: **When you break routine, no matter how small, does it completely incompacitate you as well?**  For me, whenever a routine is interrupted, changed, or altered, I can't cope!!! I just shut down!!!  Is this normal??!!  Is there research to prove this is a (secondary) symptom? Or behaviour??  I've been diagnosed with both Hyperactivity and Distractibility in ADHD.
