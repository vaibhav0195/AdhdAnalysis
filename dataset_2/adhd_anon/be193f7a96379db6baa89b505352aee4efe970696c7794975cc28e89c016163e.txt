I went through hours and hours of testing for learning disabilities and the psychologist determined that I was in fact very smart, but lacked sufficient focus. Therefore, even though I was doing well in school, I was not living up to my full potential (I started getting a 4.0 once I got treatment). I've had doctors tell me in the past that I couldn't possibly have ADHD because I always did well in school and was not disruptive. I feel like Kaiser would say this to me. Anyway, now that I've graduated I'm on my parents insurance with Kaiser. I've had troubles even getting an appointment with them. They tell me they'll call me back but then never do. I'm now running low on medication and I need it for working on my grad school applications. I have a few prescriptions from my old doctor still, but will Kaiser fill it for me? I've also heard that they make you take a drug test. Would they do this for a prescription I already have written? I smoke weed occasionally, but I hardly feel like that gives them the right to deny me my prescription. Also, would they be able to not write me a prescription in the future even though I have been formally diagnosed? Like can they take that diagnosis back?
