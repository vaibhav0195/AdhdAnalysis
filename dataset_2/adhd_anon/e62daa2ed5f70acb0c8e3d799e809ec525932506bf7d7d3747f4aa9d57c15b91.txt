I was diagnosed with ADHD (Type Inattentive) seven months ago. In addition, I suffer from anxiety and have ADD (Auditory Processing Disorder). I take Methylphenidate (Concerta) at 18mg once a day,as needed.  My questions is what techniques or coping methods do you use while you are on/of your medication? I really want to make the best of this situation!
