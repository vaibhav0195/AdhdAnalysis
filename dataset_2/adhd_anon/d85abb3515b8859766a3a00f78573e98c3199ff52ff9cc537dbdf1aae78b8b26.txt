I have a therapist that i kind of enjoy talking to and a separate nurse practitioner that i talk to about meds.  the NP started me on citalopram on the first day (my questionare showed major depression)   my question is this: is having 2 separate (non phd) people to talk to a good thing?  i feel like it could cause problems with getting an accurate diagnosis for a few reasons.  1, they arent in the room with me at the same time, so they both get two different versions of the story.  2 because one is focused on the envirnment side and one is focused on the meds side, with separate appointments on different days, i talk to them about different things, so im worried about not getting the right medications.  3 because i talk to them about different things, im not sure how much they communicate with each other about me specifically, other than the notes my therapist takes, which the NP then has to interpret in her own way (and vice versa), so im worried about errors in the diagnosis. i do have several other concerns, but is this approach normal?  did you guys go through this? where you have to talk to two different people or am i better off trying to find an actual psychiatrist? where i only have to communicate with a single person.  a single person would be able to combine all of what i would talk about into a cohesive diagnosis, at least thats my thought.  what do?
