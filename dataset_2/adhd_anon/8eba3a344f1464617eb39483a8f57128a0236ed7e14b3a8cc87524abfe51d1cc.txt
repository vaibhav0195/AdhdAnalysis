However, only 5% of adult patients have true ADD/ADHD. In addition, the symptoms can present differently in adults than they do in children.   In adults, the most debilitating problems resulting from ADD/ADHD are the executive functions such as:  planning, prioritizing, impulse control, maintaining motivation, organizing, and working memory. Patients with ADD/ADHD can be frustrating for the patient and their families as well as the doctors who are treating them.  I will describe some of the ways that ADD/ADHD can impair our patients' health and safety and then discuss some ways that you can help your patients.  How does impaired executive functioning affect the health of our patients?    1.     Higher risk of substance abuse - 10-25% prevalence    2.     Late or missed medical appointments    3.     Non-compliance or missed medications    4.     Increase impulsivity and risk of contracting STDs    5.     High prevalence of motor vehicle accidents    6.     Underperforming at work  7.     Low self-esteem    8.     Increased risk of depression and anxiety    9.     Difficulty with sleep    10.  Trouble with relationships    5 ways that we can help our patients:    Many patients are often not diagnosed as children. Thus, by using a simple 5 minute screening tool in the office or waiting room, we can help our patients that may have been misdiagnosed as borderline, chronically depressed, anxious or bipolar disorder.     Here is a site that you can give your patients:  http://counsellingresource.com/lib/quizzes/adhd-testing/adhd-asrs/  1. Many patients feel that ADD/ADHD is not a "real diagnosis" and thus don't get evaluated or treated. However, by explaining to the patients that SPECT and PET scans show differential blood flow in the prefrontal cortex in ADD/ADHD patients versus non-ADHD patients can help reinforce to the patient that this is a "real" issue.    2. Patients with ADD/ADHD have difficulty with planning and time management. Thus, they often forget their appointments or are late.     This can be extremely annoying for a busy clinician, in addition, to the patient not getting the necessary care.     Thus, a way of improving the show rate for these patients includes encouraging them to write the appointment in their calendars immediately when the appointment is made, requesting that they show up 30 minutes before their appointments, calling them the morning of their appointments (not the night before) and by charging them for missed appointments.    3. Encouraging your patients to purchase a weekly calendar and to use it on a regular basis instead of relying on post-it notes or on smart phone. Many ADD/ADHD patients do better when they see things visually.    4. Help the ADD/ADHD patient to see that they have many strengths and that ADD/ADHD is just one aspect of who they are. In addition, even though they have compensated for it most of their lives, validate that it may have been a difficult struggle and that it can get better.    5. Help the patient to understand that many of their behaviors such as underperforming at work, engaging in high risk sexual activity, or challenges in their relationships are very common in patients with ADD/ADHD and that this can get better over time with treatment, either medications or behavioral treatments.    Working with patients who have ADD/ADHD can be frustrating at times, but can be extremely rewarding. Just like cigarette cessation, it can have a significant impact on a patient's life, but with appropriate diagnosis, treatment, and intervention, a patient's health and well-being can greatly improve.
