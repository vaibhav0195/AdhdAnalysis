c1e5b27e51ca2c82a6fcda3a7b2317e374f6558d915de40afa7f3a09dfa41bfd;;;Just diagnosed with ADD/ADHD (21f) &amp; put on Ritalin. I hear lots of bad side effects. Looking for input!;;;Background: I am also diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and still trying to get that under control for which I take 30 mg of buspar( for 15 months) three times a day and klonopin (for 1 month) in the morning and evening.  I had to switch psychiatrists due to my age to be able to get treated for ADD.  He thinks i may also have OCD and started me on 10 mg of paxil last week. I took 5 mg of Ritalin at 8am &amp; 12pm for one week and am now taking 10mg twice daily.  My insurance won't pay for the ritilan BC of my age as well.  I am a junior nursing major and in the last year there has been a significant decline in my grades and ability to do homework and perform well in clinical. I withdrew from my clinical class (maternity. And pediatrics) this semester to try and get everything under control. I am now only taking 6 credits.  The psychologist that diagnosed me said he thought I would be put on concerta or adderall.   Because I am new to all of this I am just looking for some input on what meds are good and what bad side effects they come with. Also open to any suggestions for daily life.
