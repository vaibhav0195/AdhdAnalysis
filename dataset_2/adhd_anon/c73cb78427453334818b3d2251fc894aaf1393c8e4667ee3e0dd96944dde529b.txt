I'm a high school senior (almost done ;~; ), and I struggle immensely with procrastination.  It seems like even when i know i'm facing a shit-load of homework, i can't stop myself from browsing stupid youtube vidyas and watching those for hours.  Today I spent maybe three hours total watching videos, and two hours studying.  I could've spent significantly more time studying, but b/c of my procrastination I didn't.  I think it may affect my grades, but I'm not too sure.  Physics and Calc are just really difficult classes which I think explain my lower grades in those two subjects, but even so, i think procrastination plays into it.  Do you think ADHD is accentuating my procrastination problems?  Do any of you suffer greatly from it, too?  And lastly, how can I cope with it?  TL;DR I procrastinate a lot, how do I stop or cope?
