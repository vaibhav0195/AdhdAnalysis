I'm at college now and I honestly don't think I'd still be there without it, so needless to say it is working. But the problem is when I come home for summer (like I am right now) my mom always has things for me to do, which I have no problem with. I'm living in her house so it's totally fair. But the problem is that a lot of these things I just end up not doing or forgetting, and she blames me for it which I guess is correct, but I can't help it. For example, a few days ago she asked me to put some pictures from my phone onto a flashdrive for her. It took me 5 days to do because I just kept forgetting. It isn't like its a hard task, I could do it in 5 minutes or less. Its just that once she's done ranting at me about how it isn't done yet, it is out of my head and I dont think about it until the next time she gets angry. I try to tell her that I'm not putting it off because Im lazy or anything like that, but that I just keep forgetting/dont think about it. This makes her absolutely furious. She says Im using ADHD as an escape to get away from responsibilities, and at this point I'm starting to believe her. Maybe I am just lazy?? But the thing is it feels as though its impossible to get these things done, like theres a wall there blocking me from doing it or something. Idk how to explain it...she makes me feel awful when I try to tell her what its like for me to deal with these tasks she gives me and she just tells me to stop blaming it on the ADHD. She doesn't understand why I can't complete these seemingly simple chores, and frankly I don't either. Does anyone have any experience with dealing with parents and how to explain to them in a way they will understand? Thanks for reading this wall of text and thanks in advance for any answers.
