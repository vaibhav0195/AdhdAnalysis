aaa5b60560d200a81068ca24a92a3dc539d67396405b549e04f24753396a9ffe;;;I missed win Wednesday as well;;;So I have narcolepsy. I have urges to sleep, and they aren't your normal tired urges. I have adhd, too.   I couldn't ever pay attention in class or anything that was boring, but my second semester just started and yesterday...   I paid attention. I actually wrote notes on what the teacher was saying in a way I understood. I didn't even look at my phone either which is a huge distraction for me. I'm on Methylphenidate 27mg, which I hope to increase soon.   Normally in class I'd look like a kid who just shot up heroin trying to sit still and stay awake... But I was actually sitting still, no movements of tapping or anything. I'm so proud.    Thank you, r/adhd for helping me see this side of me I didn't know. I was just diagnosed narcoleptic in October and adhd the past two weeks. My first semester I almost failed out, and now I plan on getting those A grades that I never got.
