I take my pills in the morning as I said around 11am and I've been getting great amounts of sleep over the last few weeks, around 8-9 hours a night. But I notice that after 4 or so hours, the effects of the medication are gone. I have an appointment with my psychiatrist on the 8th. I will explain this to him but what can I expect to hear back? I also see people talk about other medications and some boosters (dex? i have no idea) I would like to learn more about these. Also, did anyone else ever find them selves in a similar situation? What medication were you on? And how did you resolve it?  Thanks in advance.
