There will be a project that I need to get done, but I will add things in front, which I will decide need to get done first.  While there might be some theoretical reason why I think the other project should get done first, on closer inspection, it isn't really necessary. It seems to be my brain's way of delaying the main project, the important one. Why? I am guessing, because my mind doesn't find the main project as interesting.  Currently, there is a home repair project that involves hiring a contractor to do some work. I don't like hiring contractors. But this needs to get done, and I can't do it myself. I have been saying that I need to do a different home repair project first, so that the job will be easier for the contractor (and in theory, cost me less money). Of course, this other project is something I would do myself, and I enjoy doing my own home repairs (when I'm capable of them)... But it's not a necessary project.  I'm just wondering if anyone else has recognized this kind of pattern in their thought processes? Before getting diagnosed, I don't think I ever realized how often I do this or how much it prevents me from getting things done.
