d482f0f8bf27deef7c204d699da604eb6353f276fed3221bbe455a7b9e2e68c1;;;I'm Bipolar and my girlfriend has ADHD. Any tips on dealing with conflicting symptoms?;;;Bipolar and ADHD have a ton of similarities (to the point I've wondered if I have both but haven't been able to be evaluated for that yet), but there's also things that conflict a lot (like when I get manic and have to do a ton of tasks and have to get it done now now now and she gets distracted much more easily, which can cause conflict).  I guess what I'm hoping is maybe you guys have some experience with these things and can help with how I can cope with her symptoms without getting into the angry point of mania when having an episode. I know it's just how she is and this stuff can't really be helped (symptoms can be made less bad but aren't necessarily gonna go away), and I also know the same applies to me. What kind of ideas or thought processes can I use to try and make things smoother?  To clarify, this is the smoothest relationship I've had, to be honest (she's the only person I've been with that I seriously CAN'T seem to STAY mad at), and I adore her and love how sometimes she can understand some of my symptoms better than other people since she shares some of them. I just am a realist and realize there's always room for improvement in anything, including the best relationship I've ever had. I want to make sure this lasts as long as we feel it will by just having any tips anyone can give for how these two disorders intermingle.
