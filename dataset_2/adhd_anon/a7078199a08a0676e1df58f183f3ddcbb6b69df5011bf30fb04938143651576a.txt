What are some of the things you hoped your parents did for you?;;;Short background; As the title says my son (who is 5) was finally diagnosed with ADHD. He is in Senior Kindergarten and will be in grade 1 next year.  At home we have charts, stickers, social stories and more all over our walls to help him stay on track. He has a sister who is 8 and a step brother who is 6.  **What are some of the things that looking back you wanted your parents to help you with?**  **Edit:** I wasn't expecting this many replies. I have a lot of reading to do, and I will try to answer everyone back
