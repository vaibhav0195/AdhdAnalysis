1a0ecf71c71ae985951e30b12ebb2929e1be710c7e4ecc915f7b8ee08b4f1d3a;;;I'm scared to change my dosage for my meds.;;;Right now i'm taking 70mg of vyvanse and i have been gaining weight and changing a lot and i know this causes you to change the amount or type of medicine to keep up with yourself but i don't know if i should. I feel like i'm more social, not as emotional, a slight sense of loose thought and not this robot feeling i felt before. At the same time though i i'm lacking academic wise, and im procrastinating way more often then i should. I'm getting lazy and careless but i don't want to lose my sense of my social and personality if i do change my dosage. I know if i change my meds up i'll hopefully do better but i don't want to feel this robot feeling and this hollowed out sense of identity i had when i first took them. I've been taking meds for 8 years now and i don't know what to do. Tbh im scared since its been bugging me for weeks now. Any help would be great.
