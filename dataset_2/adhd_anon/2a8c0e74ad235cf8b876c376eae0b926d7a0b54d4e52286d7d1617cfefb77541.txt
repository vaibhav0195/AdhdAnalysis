I received a new prescription with:    * Rilatine 10 mg (short-acting) * Rilatine MR 30  (intermediate-acting)  Sadly people with ADHD not diagnosed as a child don't get any refund for the medication. Moreover we don't have any generic drugs, so I wanted to see what the prices were in the surrounding countries.     I was a bit confused about the name of the second one "Rilatine MR 30". He said it should last for 8 hours, so intermediate-acting. So is this equivalent to "Ritalin SR"?     Do you have any information of names/prices in Germany, Belgium or France? When I called a pharmacy in Germany, they said they only had "Ritalin LA" and the normal one.
