a1627e2de9181200ea68dd511384a20bd7ac6801460b3ec658063bfeeaf719fc;;;ADHD and university progress;;;Over the last couple years I've failed enough subjects from university that I'm on my final appeal to remain enrolled in my course. I was recently diagnosed with ADHD-PI which is (one of the) major reasons behind failing.  Any advice on explaining the effects of ADHD to a possibly non-receptive committee, relevant information I can give them or other's experiences in similar situations?
