I already know I have anxiety and some depression, and I've looked a lot around the internet for guides on how to know if you have adhd etc. but I've had a lot of issues with health professions in recent years so I feel really uncomfortable about asking for assessment because I feel like even if I did have it it's just going to get glossed over as 'anxiety related' or whatever... so if anyone else has had a similar issue, can share experiences getting diagnosed as an adult and/or has any advice I'd really like to hear it...
