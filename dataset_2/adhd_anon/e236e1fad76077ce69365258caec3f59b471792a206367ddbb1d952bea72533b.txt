I'm an art student at CSU Channel Islands, and for our senior Capstone my group members and I created illustrated children's stories about issues related to identity and self esteem.    I chose ADHD as my focal point because we wanted to each write about a topic that was a part of our own, personal identity so as to remain more authentic and representative of our subject matter.  As a woman who was unaware that I was ADHD until I reached my twenties because of inattentive symptoms going unnoticed, it's important to me that ADHD children learn to feel accepting of themselves in spite of the difficulties they face. I want them to know that there is nothing wrong with them just because they struggle with things that some other children may not.  All of our stories are completely free to download as PDFs, and we're simply looking to spread them around in hopes that they will reach parents and children who they will be meaningful to.  If you're interested in taking a look, provided below are some links to the stories as well as social media accounts for them!    I'd love to hear any feedback if you have some. :D I was in quite a bit of a time crunch to meet deadlines for this project, (and my ADHD was certainly no help,) so it may not be perfect, but I've sunk a ridiculous amount of hours into this thing and would be grateful to anyone who feels like sharing it around.  &lt;3  Thank you!  ............................................  ♦ **Head in the Clouds; My ADHD Story-** [**[x]**](http://www.lulu.com/shop/s-grandfield/head-in-the-clouds/ebook/product-22656630.html)  Synopsis- Lia has always breezed by in school, but lately her habit of drifting off and daydreaming in math class has been earning her lower grades than she’s been used to.
