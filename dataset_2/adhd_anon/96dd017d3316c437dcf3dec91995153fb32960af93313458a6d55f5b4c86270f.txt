96dd017d3316c437dcf3dec91995153fb32960af93313458a6d55f5b4c86270f;;;I literally have to watch my coffee maker or i will forget i made coffee!;;;My dogs ration food cause i forget to feed them on schedule. I can't focus on work. As a matter of fact i just finished watching my coffee maker, watered and feed my dogs and procrastinating work at this moment. I used to have a better support system with my wife at my side, but she's been going thru hard times mentally as well. Almost all of of my family's daily lives depends on my ability to function properly. It become quite stressful!  When i was a young dumb teenager i thought i didnt know who i was as a person cause i had been on medication my whole life. So i irrationally decided to quit taking my med and talked my parents into going with it. Yeah i've struggled these past 15 or more years without the meds but i've always been able to manage it on my own with my SO support of course.  But with recent life changes, i feel myself slipping daily and my chores are building up while my motivation goes down. I have no ambition! The only thing keeping me working is my employees that depend on my to keep work coming in and my clientele that keep demanding me to work!   We'll i'm starting to lose focus again and need to change task. Ill cut this short. Life has been really hard on me the past year but it has also been really rewarding! I'm debating on going back to the Dr. and getting meds again so i can function. But i have a hard time doing it because...well just cause u know... :(  My first post here, sorry if i broke rules or any of that mess. I just really wanted to get this off my chest. If i could i would write more but i need to try and work now!
