Before then, I knew I always had attention problems because studying and paying attention in class was always an extreme challenge for me. Somehow I managed to pull off a 2.9 gpa the prior semester even with my horrendous attention span and lack of motivation, which (in my opinion) is pretty good for someone with terrible attention. I think it's because I really did give it my all... it was just my adhd that was hindering me. As a result, I proactively went out and got tested and medicated. The following semester I worked with the same ethic as I had in the first school semester. However, the results differed significantly. I ended the semester with a 3.8 gpa compared to my previous 2.9. Almost a whole point difference. I am just astonished how much vyvanse has helped me. Hopefully the effects won't fleet anytime soon.
