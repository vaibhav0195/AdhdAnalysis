Sometimes it's hard to remember the positive and it can feel like things are rarely good.*  **We win every single day.**  *We challenge you to write down your wins and see if you feel better looking at the list later in the week. Don’t worry if you miss a day or two or three! Do what you can. Even writing them down one day is a win.*   *** #####The Science Behind Win Wednesday * Scientists think our brain has a built in negativity bias by reacting more to a negative stimulus causing painful experiences to be more memorable than positive ones.    * In effect, our brain is like Velcro for negative experiences and Teflon for positive ones causing us to need a 5:1 ratio of positive to negative interactions to level the playing feild.  * By keeping track of the good you stop positive experiences from slipping away and allow your brain to gather and store the positive. and this slowly changes how your brain is wired over time.  * Much of this information comes from *The Buddha’s Brain* by Rick Hanson. Here is a PDF of his [*Positive Emotions and Taking In the Good*](http://www.rickhanson.net/wp-content/files/PositiveEmotions.pdf).  You can find more at *[rickhanson.net](http://www.rickhanson.net)*  Win Wednesday is a chance to focus on our accomplishments for the week. Doing this enough WILL change your brain for the better! *** #####The Sacred Creed of Win Wednesday:  * **Each and every one of us have victories every week, be they great or small. But in Win Wednesday, *no* victory is truly a small one.**  * **Whatever "level\" you happen to be at, progress is *always* a cause for celebration!**  * **Please don’t discount anything you have done. The whole point is to share how YOU won, and did not let your ADHD win!** Check out the examples to see what we mean!**  * The point of Win Wednesday is equally **to share our wins AND celebrate the wins of others!** If you do or don’t have a win, feel free to give positive support and cheer to those posting (not just upvoting)!  * **Each week Win Wednesday gets hundreds of views, but only 5 people replying to the winning comments...let’s change things this week!** Just saying “good job” means a lot to someone who has been struggling!  *** ##### PHENOMENAL EXAMPLES FROM PAST WEEKS: * Started reviewing for a stats test early...beat the curve...and no longer playing catch up in math class for the first time in college (PhD student). * Went to psychiatrist, started medication, feel more ‘normal’ * Wrote an essay and DIDN’T procrastinate until the last minute (not sure if I ever did this) * Went to doctor and is one step closer to ADHD diagnosis. Waiting for psych to call back. * I can change. I can learn to have goals. I can learn to have self control, and manage my time, and connect to people. I can escape the law of entropy.  ##### We love you, /r/adhd! BE PROUD and celebrate with each other! -- *your community managers.*  **Don't forget to join our other exciting weekly threads on Fridays and Sundays!**
