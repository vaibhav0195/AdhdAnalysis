c128a5d26d7a8f6cefb2ab647bc98ed3c569f3592dc7bd07617eadf1bf5e9036;;;ADHD COFFEE!;;;I was recently diagnosed with adhd as an adult 24. I always had problems since i was a kid and had depression among some anxiety. Finally went to get a good diagnosis and turns out it was adhd causing everything so he prescribed me Ritalin LA 20mg once daily. My question is I love coffee, always have. It has always helped me focus on tasks and wake me up. I am concerned that with my medication the coffee will have negative effects on me. Does any one have some advice on the topic?
