I moved hundreds of miles away, have almost no money, and moved in with my parents. I've got jobs I need to complete, but can't. I can't focus, I can't finish anything, and I'm fucking tired of it. I can't get enough money to afford insurance until I complete these jobs, but I've spent months avoiding doing any actual work.   Who do I talk to? The Psychiatrists I called charge in the 250 dollars an hour range, and I've never worked with them, is it likely they would tell me 5 more sessions and maybe you'll get what you need?   I'm in LA, does anyone know of anyone with a sliding scale? Someone who I can afford to go to, and will make sure to look at my medical history when deciding to fill a subscription, so I can finally finish what I need to do to get my life back on track.   Anything would be helpful.
