I am really excited to be finally getting help for this (thanks to finally having insurance) and I was given a packet that starts with very low doses and works up to eventually 40 mg. I believe I'm somewhere in the realm of 16 or 18 mg right now.  Anyway, I have been under a considerable amount of stress the last few days, as I'm simultaneously dealing with some basic "life" issues (car problems, finances, etc.) but I have began noticing that as I am occasionally fretting over these issues, since I began taking the Strattera (on my 3rd day) I am beginning to have what I'm guessing are palpitations. I don't know if this is a common trait in this medicine or if I'd even be having this sort of reaction this quickly, but is this something I should red alert about or is it just my body adjusting and something that will subside?  I really want to have treatment and I really don't want to be taking amphetamines if I can help it. I want this to work, but I don't know how soon it will start taking effect or if this is something even being caused by this drug. Any experience with this anyone?
