I spent most of my grade school years feeling like an outcast because i couldnt act like the other kids. spent most of high school and college feeling like a complete failure because i couldnt put the focus on long enough to finish papers or homework. managed to get staggeringly high grades on tests but couldnt do homework. Now as an adult, I struggle at work almost every day to just keep focused and do the easiest part of my job which is the paperwork and I'm finally through with it. I need help, I want to stop this and live up to my potential. how do I go about finding a doctor who can diagnose and prescribe me the right medication?
