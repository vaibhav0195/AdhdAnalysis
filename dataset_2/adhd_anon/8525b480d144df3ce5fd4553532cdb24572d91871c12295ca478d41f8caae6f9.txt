8525b480d144df3ce5fd4553532cdb24572d91871c12295ca478d41f8caae6f9;;;Diagnosed yesterday (studying in college). Called home today [20, M] - Here are my results.;;;Skip the following if you wish: _____________________________________  **History**  * 20 year old male. In college at present and only child.   * Parents are both attorneys, grew up in high expectations household. (Not that I took that badly or anything, I actually enjoyed my lifestyle and wanted it to continue.)  * Suffered through middle and high school, with ups and downs (but was generally above complete failure due to the super head start I had while growing up in my parents care.)  * I frequently misplace and/or lose items that are necessary for school and work. I've lost cellphones, iPods, my passport, credit cards, wallets, house and car keys, school ID's permission slips (from those younger days). Sheet music for instruments.   * Struggle in mathematics (since 4th grade) and foreign languages (since middle school) despite my desire to pursue both of those interests respectively.  **Diagnosis**  * Transfer student after freshman year of college, (Joined my high school debate team, which helped with college.) The college team fell apart so I left, transferring to another school in state with just barely a 3.0 *the best two academic semesters of my life.  * Started suffering again last year, the new university had a lot more activities and I gained a few close friends. Overextended myself course wise and the bottom fell academically.  ##Results  * I scored above the 90th percentile for ADHD-PI and again in a test of my age group from when they were young. **This was the second opinion, from a clinical psychologist,** recommended by the psychiatrist I sought first [and at the time believed I out to pursue a more accurate diagnosis *(and because the university I attend has a robust medical center)*].     * I elected to take the slower route because I kind of have a fear of medication. My parents were under the belief that it was unnecessary and that I'd become addicted.   * They alluded to the fact that a middle school teacher indicated I might have ADD/ADHD but were afraid to do anything because they didn't want me to be stigmatized.   * I had refused to talk to them about college, classes or grades, and while this did in the end make me feel better, it may have ultimately cut them out of the most important time regarding diagnosis.   ##What I've Learned  * The debate team helped me organize arguments and talking points into bulleted lists (it may seem as though I'm on medication now, but I'm not I also started writing this at 11:30AM and its now 1:20PM CST).  * I stay away from drugs and alcohol because a) mother prosecuted narcotics cases and b) I have a very addictive personality.  * My parents in the end were very supportive. My problem was that I had believed the countless arguments in which I was lazy. I waited for six college semesters before doing anything about it. I personally believed that one day, I'd get up and everything would be easier. I'd stop these silly and sinister distractions and just get my work done.   * Honestly before I transferred while at my first college I thought I had been 'cured' as I led myself to believe.   __________________________________ ***IF YOU SKIPPED START HERE*** *and don't give me BS about it being long. You can read the following portion.* ________________________________   **"TL:DR"** for the last part**:**   * If you fear your parents are or will be unsupportive, you should consider getting tested. Caveat: I'm not saying everybody should be tested for ADHD - I'm saying that if you have the symptoms  * Like many of you I thought my parents would laugh at the recommendations of the medical professionals - they didn't. When I spoke to my father I said exactly the same things I'd been saying before. I think that their findings allowed him (an attorney) to be more open to what I had to say.  * There were academic concerns I had hidden from my parents [starting during college], so they assumed that everything was fine when in fact it was not.   **I hope to keep you all updated about my progress. My parents have surprisingly become supportive. There's still more I have to tell them regarding grades &amp; what not, but we'll cross those bridges when we get to them.**  Have an awesome day /r/adhd. you guys rock!
