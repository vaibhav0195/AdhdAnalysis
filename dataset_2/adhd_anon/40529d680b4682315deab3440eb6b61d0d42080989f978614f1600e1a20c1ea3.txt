I visited a psychiatrist because I'll be starting school again for the third time soon and I really want to succeed. My inability to focus was never a problem until college when I found that I actually needed to sit down and study if I wanted to do well. I told her my concerns, she asked me several questions about my daily life and eventually she said that I was "textbook ADHD" and while she doesn't normally like to, she prescribed me Adderall. She told me that it should be like flipping a light switch. Aside from a little increased anxiety at first, it really has been.   I shared this information with my parents and they were, understandably, nervous. My mother thinks that I should be able to combat this without drugs and my father is worried that I'll get addicted to Adderall as it is an amphetamine. I don't necessarily disagree with my mother and I completely sympathize with my fathers concerns but they aren't in my shoes.   Adderall is at least something that I want to try. But I also want to set their minds at ease a little. I can't afford regular therapy at the moment but I'm not adverse to trying it to see if it can help a little more.   So, a couple questions for you:  Are there cheap options for behavioral therapy? Good books? Support groups?  What signs should I and those around me look for when it comes to Adderall addiction?  How did you guys deal with a skeptical parent/parents?  I've got a follow up appointment with my psychiatrist and I'll be posing these questions to her as well, but I just wanted to get some feedback from others in my situation.  Thanks in advance!  **Edit: Thanks so much for all your stories, information and advice everyone. It's really nice to know that there are other people out there with the same issues as me.**
