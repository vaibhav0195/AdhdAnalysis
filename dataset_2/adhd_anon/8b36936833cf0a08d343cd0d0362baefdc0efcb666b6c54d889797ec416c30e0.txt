A:"Hell if I knowâ€¦" - Giving others concrete info on how to handle your ADHD;;;I'm a typical case of a late diagnosed female. College is what 'gave it away.' And while I've made progress through therapy and medication, there's been plenty of regression and setbacks.  Recently I've gone through a 'downturn' in focusing and accomplishing tasks and unfortunately my tendency is to hide from the world to escape judgement from others and delaying consequences. It's not something I'm proud of.  The good news is that this downturn seems to be shorter than usual, and it took me longer in the semester to stumble. Increments, yeah?  But when I've had the conversations - the ones where I hang my head and explain I screwed up again - people (family, friends, professors, co-workers, etc) always ask, "Let me know what we can do to help you." And I have no idea. I'm barely keeping my own shit together; figuring it all out by process of trial and error.  This brings me to my major question: What should I tell them? Is there anything my fellow redditors of /r/adhd have found to be helpful from your environment? The people in it?
