13c6d41677d3ba5aa962b148c26ac3ccc348defef2343cb9b2c10ca1ad13d99c;;;Hyperactive ADHD question;;;I am curious if anyone out there has/had a super hyperactive type of ADHD. My son is seriously the tazmanian devil when he is unmedicated. Although he is only 9 now, i fear he will be like this forever. Does this type of hyperactivity calm down? will be able to learn to control it or work with it as he gets older?  I always see people post about their ADHD and it seems so calm compared to what we see in my son. No one ever explains that they were like this or are like this.   When I say Tazmanian Devil, i really mean in. This kid is Jekyl and Hyde between on and off meds.
