a0eed33ad0fc67f6f368c184df25cb193da90461ea764cd482c36626deda86e0;;;ADHD mods, I have an idea/suggestion that I think might help us out a little bit.;;;I was floating around reddit the other day and I came across an [admin post](http://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/1jr429/moderators_you_can_now_sticky_a_selfpost_to_the/) from about 3 weeks ago which allows posts to be stickied at the top of subreds by mods.  We do have a list of subreddit rules on the sidebar, but still with these we get a lot of posts by people who have either self-diagnosed or include a list of symptoms as if the community is able to confirm or deny their suspected condition.  Though the mods do an excellent job of deleting posts which don't belong I think a part of the problem is that people presenting with attentive issues (whether ADHD or not) are also going to be less likely to pay attention to the sidebar information as the sidebar info in many other subreds is fairly universal and in a way interpreted as visual background noise.  A lot of people probably come here feeling a little desperate and anxious which would also decrease their chances of giving the sidebar proper attention.  However, a top-stickied post entitled "Read before you post" on the subreddit is a little more in-your-face and difficult to skip or ignore.  It would pretty much be a duplicate set of information as is presented in the sidebar.  It could inform of the rules, links to research done on the topic, explanations, definitions of the ADHD types, and answer a lot of questions for people before they ask.  We could even have two stickied posts -- one for the posting rules of the subreddit and one that shares the general ADHD info.  Anyway, it's just a thought.  What do you think, mods?  **TL;DR**: Hello Mods!  Do you think we could add some of the sidebar info to stickied posts on the subred to make it more noticeable and visually accessible to newcomers?
