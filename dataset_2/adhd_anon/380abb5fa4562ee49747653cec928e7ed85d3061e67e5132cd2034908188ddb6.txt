As most of you probably have as well, mainly anxiety can be terrible. My doctor told me as a way to calm myself, to start writing out notes at work instead of typing them. I work in IT, so I'm always making to-do lists and so on.   My handwriting is also terrible. All my teachers growing up would complain. So by taking my time with it, It serves to calm myself, my handwriting is much better than it used to be (I guess practice makes perfect?), and with a physical list on my desk, it's easier for me to keep track of what needs to get done.  Overall, this practice has become one of the most important things I do everyday. And plus, I actually look forward to doing it now. This could be part of taking adderall though...?  Has anyone else received this advice before? Also, I wonder if the bad handwriting trait is part of ADHD. Who else has terrible, unreadable writing?  Thoughts?  Thanks guys!
