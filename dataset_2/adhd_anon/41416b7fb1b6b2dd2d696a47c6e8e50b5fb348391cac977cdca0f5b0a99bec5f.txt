Someone help?;;;Hey, I'm in the process of being medicated for my concentration and what-not. I have ADD (but in the UK it's all just bundled up and just called ADHD now) and my psych. gave me some leaflets about what medicines i should choose. I've been researching quite a bit, but all the fancy names and numerous medications I can take are overwhelming.   I am not going to take medication that requires me to take it at a set time every single day for the rest of my life since my short term memory is as good as nothing. And I have a horrible phobia of nausea so if nausea is common on these medications i will flat out refuse to take it.  I am a teenage girl and I have aspergers as well, so I don't know if my medicine will clash with that?  But all I need the medicine for is to concentrate on school work as I'm going to be home tutored.   All I want is someone to guide me in the right direction. Please just give me a quick summary of what medicine **you** take and if it's good for concentration and tell me what symptoms you have (if there is any), I've read the medication FAQ, but that kinda confused me even further. So many fancy names.  Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask lol
