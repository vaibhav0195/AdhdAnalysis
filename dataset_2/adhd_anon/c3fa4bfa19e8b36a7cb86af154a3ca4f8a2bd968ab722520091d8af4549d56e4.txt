I've made two really amazing and important friendships in the last year.  I met these people and just clicked immediately.  We seem to just 'get' each other.  Our conversations are amazing and we never run out of things to talk about.  What I have come to find out is that they too have ADHD.  Is this why we clicked like that?  Why we seem to think about things in the same way and have many many shared interests?  Even someone I chat with at work, I can talk to all day and I never knew he had it until he told me about it a few weeks ago.    I was initially in awe of meeting these people because of the level of comfort and understanding we had with each other.  Has anyone else experienced this?  Regardless of why, they will continue to be a big part of my life going forward.  I just find it fascinating is all.
