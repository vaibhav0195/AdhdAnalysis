4df928740c09f516842b61bf20ed5cdef0990d1da336bcfebdcbe67794eb6968;;;Need to vent at the idiotic regulations on meds;;;I often don't think to schedule a refill on my medication until I'm either almost out or actually out.  Usually, this isn't that big a deal, as I can get an early morning appointment to get the prescription.  I used to be able to just call ahead and they would have the prescription waiting for me, but apparently Vyvanse is so *dangerous* that I have to have a full office visit now just for a refill.  So today I call to make an appointment.  I took my last dose yesterday, and as today is Friday, it wasn't that big a deal to be unmedicated for a day.    Surprise surprise, one of the two doctors is out of town, and the remaining doctor is booked solid.  Next available appointment is *7 days* from today.  And there is apparently absolutely nothing they can do to see me sooner than this.  I'm incredibly frustrated and angry right now at the idiotic regulations and rules that those of us with ADD and ADHD have to deal with as a result of idiot people abusing the medication that we need to have a hope of functioning normally.  It's because of them that I can't get more than 30 days supply at a time.  It's because of them that I have to have a full doctor's visit every month, just to get my refill.  It's because of them that the less educated look down on me for "not trying hard enough".  I'm not some tweaker, trying to get some cold meds for a quick fix.  I'm not a methhead, trying to cook up something to sell.  I'm not a lazy college student looking for an easy way to study.    I'm a working professional.  I have a job that requires me to be able to focus and pay attention to details, and the medication I'm on helps me to do that.  And now, thanks to the above, I get to try to go without for a week.
