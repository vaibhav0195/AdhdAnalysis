311260b7fb8aa18443ff83f14c2eb888ba3801c8447ada7ea6fcd23736573008;;;New to meds and treatment;;;I had informally been diagnosed (by every teacher, guidance counselor i ever met) as early as second grade with ADD but was never reccomended treatment because I always managed to pull off great test scores and ok grades (though not without lots of epic battles with my parents). It has always been something I just kind of lived with but never really dealt with.  Now I'm all grown up and as it does, life has become vastly more complex. Two young children, getting a house ready to sell, moving etc has become a whole lot to manage, even with the coping mechanisms I've developed. It created enough anxiety that, with the support of my wife, I finally talked to a doctor about it.   Now I am on my third day of meds and holy crap... I haven't felt this good ever. I spent the weekend being super productive, calm, focused etc. My frustration threshold is immensely higher, I am getting along better with everyone.  I know that its not possible that it will always be like this, but I honestly didn't expect the drugs to do anything so I am really impressed with the results.  I know am really starting to take the issue seriously and am wondering what else I could or should be doing as far as treatment. I have seen a bit about cognitive behavioral therapy and exercise being really beneficial.   I also am wondering a lot about diet and meds (I'm on a starter dose of Vyvance), particularly since I have had basically no appetite. I asked my doctor about that and she didn't have anything to say about it. I can afford to lose quite a bit of weight so I'm not concerned about force feeding myself for the sake of eating, I'm just wondering if there are any diets, foods or eating habits that make the meds more or less effective?
