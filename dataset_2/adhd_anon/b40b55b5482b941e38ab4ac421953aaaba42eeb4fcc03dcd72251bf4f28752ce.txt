New to my ADHD diagnoses!;;;Hey guys, so my doctor decided to prescribe me a small dosage of ritalin ir along with my adderall xr after I complained that the XR wasn't lasting long enough into the day for me.  I guess my question is, is this typical to be prescribed both Ritalin and Adderall? And do you have suggestions as to what I should take first? Any differences in how they might make me feel?  My diagnosis has been recent and I've LOVED the adderall, it's literally been life changing. Just trying to not go into this blindly now with two different meds. Thanks in advance!
