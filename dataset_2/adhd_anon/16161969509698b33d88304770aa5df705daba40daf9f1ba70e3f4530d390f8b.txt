16161969509698b33d88304770aa5df705daba40daf9f1ba70e3f4530d390f8b;;;THANK YOU!;;;This is my first post, I have commented on a few other posts and read many of other people's experiences and it has honestly helped. When I was diagnosed, I freaked out and was really down on myself for not getting help before I graduated. I was filled with regret and then when I started taking meds, I began to be motivated and actually want to go to work and get stuff done. I read through your personal experiences and in my head I'm say, "thats me" or "that's my life." Im just happy that there are more people like me than i thought there were.   Thank you for sharing your stories and questions! :)
