I've been diagnosed with ADHD since I was in elementary school, but my mother thought that it was best not to put me on meds (as she doesn't believe that I have ADHD), and I've always struggled with my academics most of my life. My mind is pretty much all over that damn place and I find it almost impossible to even study, even if my gpa is on the line.  I tried convincing my mother that I should at least explore medication, and she agreed to at least go and get a prescription from my doctor. However, the moment we got my prescription, my mom basically hid my prescription and eventually flushed my meds after they expired. I ended up failing a class last semester and my ADHD has only gotten worst as of late.   At work, I'll easily have well over 50 tabs open on my work machine and at times I'll end up being easily distracted by the most minor things or ending up lost daydreaming at work. I'm not sure if this is within my legal rights now that I'm 18, but can I go behind my mother's back and get my own prescription without her consent?   tl;dr: I'm 18 and my mother doesn't believe I have ADHD. Can I get meds without her consent?
