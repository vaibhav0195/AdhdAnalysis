Last night I think to myself 'don't forget to gas up before going to work, you're going to be too tired to do it on your way back and it's nearly empty'.  Go to work today.  I get there and remember I need to gas up.  Try to find wallet, I forgot it.  Manage to find 3.50$ cash in coins.  Find my debit after 10 minutes of awkward looking around my car for more cash.  Go work.  Come back, only to find that I've no idea where I put my debit card.  Freak out thinking I don't have enough money.  Spend another 10 minutes trying to scrap extra cash.  Then decide to call home from my cell for a possible baillout - just in case I run out of gas -  only to find that I forgot to add more money on my pay as you go account.  Then I think 'oh well let's go to the bank' to get a new bank card to get some cash to gas up.  I get there it's closed.  Managed to sweet talk myself into getting an employee to get another card for me anyhow - while waiting outside because it's closed.  Get cash.  Gassed up.  Got home - speeding obviously.  Lovely day.  Day before, after work I got to my car only to realize I left my key in my coat that I left in the building.  FUN stuff.  It's funny because the field I work in is fast paced as heck and I'll thrive but shit like this happens to me everyday...  Lol been thinking of being diagnosed for years but never quite got past the procrastination of going for an appointment.
