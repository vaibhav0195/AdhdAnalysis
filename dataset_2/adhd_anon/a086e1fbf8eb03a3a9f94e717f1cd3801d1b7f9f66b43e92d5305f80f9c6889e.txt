I was diagnosed with ADHD in September after years of misdiagnosis (everything from bipolar to schizoaffective). Unfortunately, in early November, I got a serious case of the flu that lasted until January, so I blew my medical budget and had to stop the medication (though it was tremendously helpful). After I got better, I felt so much improved compared to being laid up in bed puking, that I didn't think to go back and get my medication refilled. Now that finals are looming and I've got nothing done and can't even read a sentence without losing focus, I'm freaking out and have to start the meds up again if I want any chance of passing.  My only apprehension is a side effect that drives me crazy: I chew the hell out of my lips, cheeks, and tongue when I take the medication (Concerta 54mg). My whole mouth gets visibly swollen and is really uncomfortable. I try chewing gum, but if I don't have any on me, I'll still just do it without thinking about it.   Does anyone else deal with similar side effects? Is there any good way to avoid it, or at least a good method of mitigating the effect?
