This have been going good but recently it has been a little rocky. I was starting to get pissed off at her because she would zone out when I would talk to her, she would forget plans that we would make, she would occasionally lose interest in me and so on. I feel the way have excellent chemistry and we are a great match. I was complaining to a mutual friend about her behavior and he let me know that she has ADHD. She has never told me about ADHD and I feel like I have been treating her like a total jerk because I did not know about her condition. Is it appropriate to talk to her about ADHD? Or should I leave it up to her to tell me about it? By understanding she has ADHD is making me feel a lot better about the relationship because before I thought she was blowing me off and I feel that she should know that. But I don't know if she will get pissed off, if I bring it up
