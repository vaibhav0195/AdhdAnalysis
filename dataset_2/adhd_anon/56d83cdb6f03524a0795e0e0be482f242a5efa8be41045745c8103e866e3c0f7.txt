56d83cdb6f03524a0795e0e0be482f242a5efa8be41045745c8103e866e3c0f7;;;Can we crowd source to find a solution?;;;Ok I posted this a couple of days ago:  https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/51l6ok/the_mystery_of_good_days_and_bad_days/  and from it I saw lots of us have the same things that seem to help, but only sometimes. No one seems able to work out what makes 'good' or 'bad' days.  Anyway, last year I saw Sir Dave Brailsford (super successful cycling coach) - He developed a simple app to track how his riders were feeling and how they were doing.  Could we use the collective bits of focus we all have to put something together that could do something similar?  If we could collect data on exercise, diet, meds, perceived productivity etc etc, from enough people, perhaps we could produce usable data to work out the route to a 'good' day.   It's just an idea, I have no skills in programming, data analysis, but I want to be proactive.   TL;DR I think we could crowd source data to make dealing with ADHD better.
