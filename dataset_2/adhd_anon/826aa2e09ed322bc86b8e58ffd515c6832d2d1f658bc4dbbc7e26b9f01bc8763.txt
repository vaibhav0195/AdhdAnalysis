826aa2e09ed322bc86b8e58ffd515c6832d2d1f658bc4dbbc7e26b9f01bc8763;;;Doctor diagnosed me with depression again instead of referring me to psych like I asked;;;For my entire life I have been unable to focus and study, or read a book without perfect ideal conditions. I find myself always making organizational leaps in my life only to never fulfil them or ignore them after a week. Instead of doing the important things I need to for work, life or advancing my life I would instead, take a nap or suddenly feel the need to scrub the whole kitchen at 3:30am.   I just reciently realized I should be legit tested for ADD/ADHD. My partners mother is RN who has it and she advocated me seeing the doctor to get a referal to get tested.   Previously in 2012 I was diagnosed with depression and prescribed wellbutrin. This was after college ended and I was doing nothing but working a job I despised. It was horrible and I hated everything more once taking that drug. I felt like I was always looking through frosted glass. I stopped taking it.   I made the appointment and went, asking specifically to get a referal to get tested for ADHD/ADD. He and I have never met before as he's the new doctor to the staff. He asked me what symptoms I presented with leaving me to scramble with words and panic. I just kind of threw sentences at him, trying to recall specifics. He stopped me and told me he thinks I have depression and would like to give me wellbutrin again. He told me I needed to lose weight and work out as it will help with that. I just sat there and cried. He knew me for all of 10 minutes with no questions or testing and decided my future for me.   How do I move past this? I'm not going to take that damn medicine again, and I can't see a specialist until I get a referral.   I'm considering calling to make a office appointment with him and talk further. I want to write everything down before going in so I'm not scrambling or panicking.
