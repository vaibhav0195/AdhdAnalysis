I was diagnosed with ADHD last year and started medication later that year. It's literally been a huge turning point in my life but I'm still struggling to come to terms with and get over all the anxiety, depression and self-hatred I'd cultivated in myself from never being able to be like other people. I'm really proud of having gotten my diagnosis and with the help the medication has given me I'm finally persuing a degree in science which is something I never thought I'd be able to do.  Now to my rant; I'm just so tired of dealing with people who obviously have no idea about ADHD making crazy and often, insulting claims. There's one aquaintence of mine who is especially vocal about how ADHD doesn't exist and that we're just medicating our kids so we don't have to deal with them being kids, etc. I just don't know how to deal with that kinda stuff you know? People like this person especially aren't worth the time and effort of trying to correct them and I've proceeded to block her posts but it's hard not to take things personally when you see someone in your life insisting (not to my face mind you) that your struggles aren't real and that you're medicating a fake condition.  Anyway, thanks for reading guys! Feels good to get that off my chest.
