Whatever that means. After a couple of months of tests, referals, and mostly waiting, i have been diagnosed with the combination subtype of ADHD. I was prescribed 40mg Vyvanse daily for the next month. I have finished more projects today than I ever have in one day, and I feel euphoric. I feel less restless than I ever have. Most of all, I feel like I can navigate interpersonal relationships better. To keep it short (since you all have ADHD :P), I can only define how i feel as awake for the first time. I look forward to contributing to this subreddit, but most of all i look forward to a long career of lurking :) -ManiacalMania (I suppose MellowMelody would be more appropriate now)
