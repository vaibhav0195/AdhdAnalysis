db25ddb6721f2ea6ae4dcd36334d978ab1c23011e859cfec5bac8cc9644096fb;;;I haven't been tested and I'm really scared about my future. Anyone got some life advice?;;;Sorry if the title seems really melodramatic, but it's the truth.  I haven't been tested for ADHD and I am really scared for my future and slightly freaking out right now and need to get this off my chest.  I'm a sophomore in Civil Engineering and I just failed my first class.  I don't want to brag but I've been an A to B student all my life, went to one of the best high schools in my state, but then I hit college where everything seemed to be moving so fast and I started making C's in classes and just now I found out I officially Failed a class where I tried SO HARD IN, or at least I thought I did until I looked back at all the work I did studying only to realize I really didn't do as many practice problems as I thought  I want to get tested now, but who knows how soon I can get scheduled so I might just get a screening by my college and see what they have to say about it.    I'm just really worried because it's never dawned on me that I might have a learning disability until I took this class, and despite my best efforts, failed it.  How do I know I'm just not trying to score some drugs to help me study?  What if I really don't have a learning disability and I'm just not as smart as I thought?  What if I really do though?  It's not like I want to be diagnosed with a disorder, but my damn pride makes me want to keep telling myself that I'm not dumb and the only reason I failed was because a disability is holding me back  I'm a little sad, angry, scared, and numb right now.  I just need some advice and maybe a couple life stories/advice that I might be able to relate to help me cope a little.  Was anyone else ever in my position or something of the like?
