How can I create structure for myself and stick to it?;;;Hi, r/adhd!   I've been diagnosed with ADHD-PI for around 2 years now, as well as having GAD. Recently, I've started to notice a HUGE difference in my personality at work in comparison to at home.    At work, I am **SUPER** type-A. I work at Starbucks and feel as if I absolutely **NEED** to follow all of the operational procedures, standards, and drink recipes to absolute perfection. My co-workers even make remarks that I have OCD (which as far as I know it's just anxiety). The thing is, if I don't follow the routines I feel out of whack. Having the set in stone organization helps me thrive in the workplace. But--if things are in the wrong spot, my bar is a mess, or there's a lot of chaos around I start to get very uneasy. I keep my space so tidy and cleaned at all times, and pretty much follow a strict routine every day. I feel in control, on top of things, clear-headed, and very non-adhd in my work environment for the most part.   **Once I am home-- a completely different story.** My car is a mess, full of crap that "I think I might need" my closet is overflowing, my drawers start out all nice and tidy and by the next day are a jumbled all together, I can't stick to any personal goals or objectives unless someone else creates a structure for me (hence why I just hired a personal coach to make me training/nutrition plans despite being in the health/fitness field), I miss little details on important things, and overall drive myself nuts.   Basically, I cannot for the life of me create my own structure. I try to make set in stone organizational habits in my home life but they never stick. At work, I don't know if it's just my need to please my manager/customers that causes me to be so crazy on top of things... but I do know that I feel much more at ease with that organization. I like when there is already a structure to follow, I am good with that.   Have any of you been in similar situations? Or does anyone have any advice for how I can carry over my intense work organization to my real life living situations?   **TLDR: Super type-A in work environment, but a disorganized mess outside of work. How can I try to create structure for myself in my home life?**
