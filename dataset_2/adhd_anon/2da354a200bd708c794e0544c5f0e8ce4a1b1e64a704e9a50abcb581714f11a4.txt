(Possible side effect);;;A friend of mine has knows I was diagnosed with ADD when I was young and have been taking 30mg of Adderall the entire time. Recently he's been telling me to stop taking the medication, because I'm addicted/dependent on it to function in school. I'm currently in my second year of collage, I never take more than my prescribed amount, never abuse adderall, and don't use it outside of school. Weekends, holidays, and summer I'm completely off my medication. I've never thought of myself as dependent on adderall, but my friend is convinced that I've taken adderall for too long (30mg 5 days a week during, only during school, for the past 9 years) and that my mental health is at risk. Is there any merit to his claims.
