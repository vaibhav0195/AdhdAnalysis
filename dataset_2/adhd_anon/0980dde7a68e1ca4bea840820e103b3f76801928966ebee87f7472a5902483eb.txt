I had some minor side effects, dry mouth, minor weight loss. My sleeping pattern improved DRAMATICALLY, I was feeling tired around 5pm and I would go to bed around 10-11 (instead of 2-5am)  I had a follow up after a month and she decided to have my try Adderall XR instead, I believe it was 10mg the first week and 20mg after that. My concentration level stayed around he same, but my wife noticed I was more aggressive and I would get stuck on minor details. Side effects were the same but my sleep pattern went back to "regular" and I would go to bed really late.  At my monthly follow up she decided to switch it to Biphentin 10mg for the first week and 20mg after. This medication did NOT agree with me at all. The first week I thought it was some kind of withdrawal affect from the Adderall but once I started taking 20mg I knew something was wrong, I didn't feel like myself at all, I would hyper focus on everything and I could feel myself get angry but i felt like i couldn't stop it. I stopped taking it after 2 days of 20mg and went back to the doctor. At that point I was still getting the dry mouth and slight weight loss.  New prescription is 20mg of Ritalin SR in the morning and another 20mg after lunch. The weird thing is the side effects all seem to be gone (no more dry mouth and my weight went back up a bit), but also my concentration is not even at the level it was when I was taking the original prescription of just 20mg a day. I'm starting to wonder that maybe pills aren't helping me and maybe I should just stop taking them and attempt to deal with my issues on my own, any one else had issues figuring out the right medication? I've been taking the 2 x 20mg for a month now.  TL;DR: Started on Ritalin SR, helped quite a bit but the effect didn't last. Switched to Adderal XR that brought some issues so I was switched to Biphentin which REALLY didn't work out. Back on Ritalin SR but I feel like it's not helping.
