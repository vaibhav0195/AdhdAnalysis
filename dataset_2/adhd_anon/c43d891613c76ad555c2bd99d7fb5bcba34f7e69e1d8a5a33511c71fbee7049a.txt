I had always gotten by with A-/B+ grades by procrastinating a lot and leaving everything for a couple all nighters. I barely studied for tests and didn't read the books we were supposed to and was known as the kid who never really did his work but still did pretty well.   However, during second semester I had a lot of other personal things going on and ended up going to see a psychiatrist who pretty quickly diagnosed me with ADD and started me on vyvanse. It made a huge difference and I was able to pick up my grades which had fallen to mostly B+/B-'s.   Since then I've taken medication off and on, partly because of the side effects, but mostly because I still feel like I'm cheating somehow by taking medication. I know I can get by without medication, but I get so much less out of school when I do and it's so much more stressful. I feel weird about the idea of taking a pill nearly every day for the rest of my life to function properly and I can't seem to stop thinking the braver route is to move on without medication.   How does /r/adhd feel about this? Are there any personal experiences/things to read or watch that you think would be helpful and might clear this up for me?
