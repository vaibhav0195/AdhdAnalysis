But I am scared to switch to something else.;;;So I have been using Strattera for the past 6-7 years since I was diagnosed and treated for my ADHD, I went from using 25mg to 80mg for 6 years. But I upped my dosage all the way to 100mg(The maximum) this August. The problem is that I no longer feel like Strattera is being effective for me. I can't seem to remember anything important, I constantly double book myself, forget important items(I forgot my bike at my church and only realized when I got on the bus, had to walk back and get it), and just feel like I am going through life at the seat of my pants. I get so frustrated every time I just do something out of instinct and I don't think about it and I think that my medication is not strong enough for me anymore. It used to work really well when I was in highschool and my first couple years of Bible College but now I am not sure what to do anymore.  I know I need to switch to something else but I am not sure what. I am currently a designer at my church and I do a lot of creative work in general and I know right now that my medication does not get in the way of that creative talent. I find that my ability to just come up with ideas has very much to do with the fact that my mind is going so quickly that my ideas instantly come out of my head and onto the screen; and because of this, I am scared that if I switch to a stronger medication, that I will lose that creative impulse.  So I am not sure what to do. I definitely know I need something that is stronger for me because I can't live with this much stress because of the stupid decisions I make. But I am scared that I will forfeit my creativity for the sake of being sane.
