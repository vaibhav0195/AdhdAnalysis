e4ae337b453b49542ce19c1d9ffef4e1a1c1d699319fc2c9bd0332f2c2c6623c;;;So I finally got diagnosed on Saturday..;;;Win! Specifically, the doctor diagnosed my as the combined type, which I'm almost certain is correct.  My psychiatrist put me on Strattera, which, so far, has enabled me to clean my room. Such a shocker. I'm the 25mg pill first and later on will be taking 40, then 60, then 80.  On 25mg, I still have troubles with concentration. I tried reading a couple of paragraphs from a book or a magazine but I still wasn't able to read thoroughly and my comprehension is still lacking.  What is YOUR experience with non-stim drugs?
