If you have ADHD, you're more likely to also be diagnosed with anxiety, correct?  On to the real question: Does that work in reverse? Are people with anxiety also more likely to have ADHD? And would knowing someone has a family history of anxiety (but no diagnosis, positive or negative, themselves) be useful in diagnosing them with ADHD?
