What can I expect?;;;I've been taking 30 mg of Adderall daily for 6 years. I started taking it after I was diagnosed with ADD and it helped a ton. I'm sure most of you guys understand. But the side effects have definitely presented themselves more and more especially in the past year. My anxiety levels have really spiked, I'll find my heart racing at times for no reason, inability to sleep, reoccurring bouts of cystic acne well into my 20's (this isn't a listed side effect, but I've read what seems to be hundreds of posts stating that adderall and acne are definitely connected, my Doctor has even said there may be a connection). I also hate to think that my metal capacities are only what they are because of a pill I'm taking.      After talking with my Doctor we've decided to try tapering off my dosage. This is my last month on 30 mg. Next month it will be 20. If all goes well the next month will be 10 and so on. While this seems like the best way to do it, I am slightly concerned. When I forget to take my pill for the day I become the most lethargic person in the world. While on the meds I wake up everyday at 4:30 to workout, I'm the first person to work, and I can work all day, then I go home and can focus on my own pursuits all night. I eat healthy, I read a ton... I'm just really happy with where I am as a person, and I don't want to lose that because I had to stop taking adderall. Does anyone know how long it takes for your energy to return to normal levels (if it does at all) once you've stopped with adderall? Does anyone have any advice about how to deal with life post adderall? Thanks a ton for any advice you can give me.
