Doc doesn't believe me.;;;Recently diagnosed (Monday) and prescribed 5mg of Dextroamphetamine IR. First dose, made me calm and relaxed/sleepy. The next few days I took 10 mg. If i was lucky enough to not get the sleepy feeling i would be "in the zone" and able to start/complete mundane daily tasks. For only 2 hours. After that (or sometimes I dont get the zone but this happens still) I get extremely tired and fatigued. If i get the effects Im happy, and feel motivated. and then its like night and day within an hour later I could be extremely sad and think that i cant do anything again. And then i just feel like garbage until my allocated bed time (trying to practice sleep hygiene due to insane insomnia, prior to taking stimulants) However, I have noticed my ability to remember that bed time. And for the past couple days had the ability to follow a "plan".   I understand the rules of this subreddit. and I did ask my doctor about it yesterday. He just gave me a funny look and moved on with his questioning.   Also, when I felt tired after taking 2 doses, i tried taking a third (total 15 mg in one day - about 4ish hours after the first 10). And this didnt do anything. No change)   Am I doing something wrong here? also, i should point out, ive been finding it extremely difficult to remember to eat..
