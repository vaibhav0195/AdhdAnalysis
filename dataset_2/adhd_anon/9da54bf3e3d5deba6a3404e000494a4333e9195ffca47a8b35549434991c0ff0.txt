So I went and talked to him, told him about that, my waiting till the last second to do work, never paying attention during school, even though I graduated with honors, and at work it was worse, zoning out 6 hours a day, but always doing enough work (coding, etc) to keep my job and boss happy. I never was diagnosed during childhood, it never came up.   The doctor said that I am not adhd because I never had symptoms as a child. I'm not sure If I did or not, but I'm kind of depressed now because I know how real my focusing issues are, and I like to paint things in a better light than they actually are. He said to come back and we'll talk about interpersonal relationships, but thats not what im worried about, I'm worried about how I will hold down a computing related job when my inattention gets up to massive levels.  What should I do? Consult another doctor? It took me so long to muster the courage to see this one...
