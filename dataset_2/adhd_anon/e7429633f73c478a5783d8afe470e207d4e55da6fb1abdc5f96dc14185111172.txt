I had a consultation with a social worker who asked me a lot of questions, ranging from simple questions like “What do you do for a living?", to more complex questions like “What motivates you?" Anyway, at the end of the questions she told me that she thought I may actually be depressed opposed to having ADHD. However, she still gave me a referral for **actual** adhd testing. So I have an appointment for that in a few months AND I'm going to be seeing a psychiatrist regarding her depression suspicions.   I've been reading that most adults who are diagnosed with adhd also have issues with depression. Also when she read the symptoms of depression and inattentive adhd, respectively, in the DSMV they seemed to overlap.   My question is have your adhd symptoms been misdiagnosed as symptoms of depression? Or do you have both depression and adhd?
