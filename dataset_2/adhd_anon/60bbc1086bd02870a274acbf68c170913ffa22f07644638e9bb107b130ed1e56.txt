I'm talking grades that are average at best, putting kitchen utensils in the microwave, getting half-way to the bus stop before realising I've forgotten my school bag, etc.   What I should also mention is that understanding and support for ADHD is *at least* limited in Bulgaria. I'm pretty sure Adderall, Ritalin, Concerta, and the like are not distributed here.   My family is completely sure I'm just a lazy and rebellious teenage boy who doesn't know what's good for him. I don't want them to know anything unless I get diagnosed *and* am offered a satisfactory treatment method.  I'm a bit scared, because I don't know how the whole process works(internet searches for ADHD in Bulgarian lead me to people looking to buy Adderall from abroad and the wikipedia article on it). I guess I should go to my GP and talk to her about it, but from then on I'm clueless.   So enlighten me, what must I do? And please keep in mind, I'm not trying to get high *nor* have I diagnosed myself. I know very well that any kind of self-diagnosis is inappropriate and inadvisable.  TL;DR: 18-year-old anxious about getting diagnosed. Not sure what to do. I guess I'm looking for encouragement more than anything.   P.S. This probably doesn't read well. I'm sorry, I'm a terrible writer.
