I won't bore you with a list of ADD symptoms but over many years I have come to realize that I fit the primarily-inattentive description to a tee. I pursued this some in high school but my parents were very unresponsive primarily because I get good grades for the most part, am very smart/articulate, and they are generally dismissive of psychiatry. I have pursued my school's counseling services, which helps a little, even got a prescription for Wellbutrin (I didn't want to go on an SSRI, but it helps very little), but I don't think they can get me a real diagnosis or counseling/medication for ADHD (as far as I know they give out primarily prescriptions for antidepressants as those are less problematic to be giving out to college students). I have concurrent anxious and depressive symptoms in addition to my motivation/focus deficits (why I got the Wellbutrin scrip). I have this strong feeling of impending doom- every time i need to muster any kind of focus or motivation I fail, and I have basically crossed everything else off the list (by which I mean diet, exercise, meditation, counseling, etc.). One of these days I won't be able to get by on sheer intelligence alone and I just don't know what I'll do.   edit: I forgot to mention that in the past when I have had truly large tasks that required extensive focus (besides tests-which I am very good at), I have always had some sort of crutch, generally my mother, my peers, or clandestinely obtained ADHD meds.
