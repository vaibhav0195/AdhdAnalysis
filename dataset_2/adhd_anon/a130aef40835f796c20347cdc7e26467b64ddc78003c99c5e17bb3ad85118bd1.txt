It was raining very badly and we were going have to run about a mile through the rain to get to the venue, so I was, of course, distracted when we were getting out of the car. When am I ever NOT distracted? So, I grabbed my stuff and we jetted. Well, when we get back to the parking lot, I see my keys in the ignition and my car is still running! This was in downtown Houston, so I can't believe it didn't get stolen.
