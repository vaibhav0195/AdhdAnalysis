a9d2261e50ff2c69fd52aff6b41fc0c0b17d0da2cb3b5de73d48651dc969fb00;;;Management without meds?;;;I have not been formally diagnosed with ADHD but I fit every single indicator. I have been struggling for as long as I can remember. I tried to get a diagnosis once but my doctor didn't believe me and was generally unhelpful while makingme feel like a moron. Now I have a baby I am breastfeeding and am hoping to have a second. So, meds are off the table for a couple of years.   Dooes anyone have strategies that work especially well for them? I have a couple of books I use: ADHD Friendly Ways to Organize Your Life and The Disorganized Mind, but I feel like I am spinning out of control. I am letting deadlines slip at work, and I can tell I am about to backslide into a full career slump. Is anyone else successfully managing ADHD without meds? Is it worth getting a diagnosis if I can't take any meds anyway?
