05bc902fa4abbdb9382baa42e3b6f34e8722f66132ee8abaa9bf99ad4bffa156;;;Stuck in a career cycle - 'til I retire;;;**TL;DR;** *Finished uni, got job, hated job, stays for 6 years as no idea what I wanted to do instead and I just shut down, coasted along and kept out of the limelight; made redundant; new job, same position, bored already; think often of new career but not sure if that's just my ADHD speaking; Fear I'll change career and within 6 months will be bored again and hating that job (potentially ruining a hobby in the meantime)*  At university I had a year out in industry (A 'gap year' so to speak, to get a job in the industry I'll be working). I went for a dev job as this was where my interest lied but I ended up in a testing job. I hated every minute of it, but stuck out the full year for the grade. It wasn't just the testing that I hated, but office work, 9-5. I went back to university for my final year with regret that I made the wrong choices but I did what I do best and coasted along through the final year to graduation falling asleep in every lecture and cramming before every test and came out with a good grade.  However, at this point I still hated the fact I was going to be desk bound until I retired but did what I knew best, I bottled it down and got a software dev job. This was better, but I still hated the 9-5 daily grind of a desk job; within 4-6 months I was completely fed up and used to go home in a blind rage screaming in my car at how much I hated it. However I did what I knew best, I bottled it up and carried on. Occasionally the odd perk came along which helped alleviate the pain and eventually I got to work from home every day!   I stayed at that job (my first job out of university) for 6 years because I didn't know what I wanted to do instead and I'd argue with myself that 'it wasn't a bad job, other people would like it, what's wrong with me!?'. So again, I did what I do best, I shut down and coasted along. Except this time it became too much and I had to go and see someone because my rage was becoming unmanageable, I hated myself for it; I got this more under control again and carried on coasting until I was made redundant - the day those words came out of HR's mouth I was overwhelmed with joy (but I kept it low key, in my head and pretended to act as if I cared slightly), to the point that I was complimented at just how well I dealt with the situation.  Still, at this point I didn't know what I wanted to do instead but at this time I had spent so much time analysing everything that I started to notice that my difficulties were a lot like someone with ADHD, and I had many symptoms (present since childhood) that I saw a GP who referred me. In the meantime, I needed to get myself a new job. I have bills to pay, people depending on me, a pet to take care of. To do all that I needed a job, and a good one - So I bottled up my other career ideas and ambitions and got a new job as a software dev. Shortly into this I got officially diagnosed as ADHD combined type of a mild severity.  So, here I am today - 6 months into my job - the honeymoon period has worn off and I'm bored... but I'm doing what I do best, bottling it up and pushing on... even though I hate ever working minute of my working life - eventually I know I'm going to break but I don't know what else to do.  **To conclude**  ... I think I need a career change, I've thought that for 8 years but here's the thing...  * I know that, technically speaking, I have a good job * I have so many ideas of what I could do instead but I fear I'll be bored of them in 6 months * I have so many ideas of what I could do I don't know which to persue in case I pick the wrong one * Any career change I make will be a step backwards with less pay and financially I'll struggle * After a career change, I'd probably end up realising I should have just stuck it out as a software dev - after all, I'm so far in now  So I don't know where to go from here other than doing what I know best. Bottling it down, sucking it up, pushing on through, not going above and beyond and raising everyones expectations but doing enough to not raise any eyebrows...  Until, of course, I break!**
