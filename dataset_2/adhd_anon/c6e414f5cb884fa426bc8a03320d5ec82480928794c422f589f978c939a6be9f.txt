c6e414f5cb884fa426bc8a03320d5ec82480928794c422f589f978c939a6be9f;;;Dr. Barkley reads me like a book;;;I just finished watching a video from a link in a recent post about people who don't have adhd giving advice to those that do. Dr. Barkley is just amazing. He explains adhd with a passion that helps others get a very small taste of what we go through every goddamn day. And, every one of his videos brings me to tears and makes me laugh because he truly understands what I have gone through and what i am currently going through. I wish the world was filled with more people like him.   If you ever read this Dr Barkley, thank you so much for the work you have done. You can not imagine what this means to me, to us.
