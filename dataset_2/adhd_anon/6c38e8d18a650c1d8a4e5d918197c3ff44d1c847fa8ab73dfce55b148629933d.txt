6c38e8d18a650c1d8a4e5d918197c3ff44d1c847fa8ab73dfce55b148629933d;;;Why am I such a failure?;;;This picture pretty much speaks for it self  http://imgur.com/Rk4EbSR  It is this time of the year when the semester ends and wow look at that, I passed only 1 out of the 2 classes I registered for this semester...   All my friends and cousins **younger than me** are posting their **4-Year** college graduation pictures and here I can't even complete a **2 year** degree that I have been working on since I graduated High School in 2009. I am now 23 years old, and I do not even feel like going back to my hometown for Christmas because I know everyone will ask me why I haven't graduated yet. I feel worthless.  I discovered this subreddit around September 2014 and reading everyone's stories made me go visit a doctor. I was immediately diagnosed with ADHD and was put on Stratterra (which I feel is useless). However it is now too late. I have been put on Academic Suspension for excessive failed/withdrawn classes for the next semester so now I'm stuck here being worthless for another semester. I do not know if I can even go to the Disabilities Center on Campus to see if I can appeal this. This suspension will fuck me over because  I only need 12 more credits to graduate...  What do I do? I'm here in a city 400 miles away from my family  by myself and I feel alone because I feel like everybody is judging me.
