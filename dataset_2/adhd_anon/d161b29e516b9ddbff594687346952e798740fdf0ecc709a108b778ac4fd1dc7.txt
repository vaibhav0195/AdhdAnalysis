My sophomore year of high school, I peaked with dosage increases, and hit my proverbial rock bottom.  Depression, anxiety and irritability ran rampant during those times.  Since then, I've been reducing my dosages in an attempt to get off of the stuff. Right now, i'm on a fairly insignificant dosage compared to how much I weigh.  But even still, when I don't take my meds, I'm an unproductive zombie that can barely keep from drooling. Part of that is to be due to some kind of medicine dependence. I'm just not used to not being on medicine.  My life has been a perpetual struggle with mental disciplined.  I feel like I have accomplished a lot in the field, but still I wonder if medication is carrying me through it.  And, probably as a function of my type A personality, I feel like the end goal for me will be to be able to function completely fine off of medication. Anybody else going through the same thing who can give any advice?

My parents paid someone for this?;;;I was doing my physics homework and i had a thought, and subsequently was not doing my physics homework. My parents paid a therapist to do this with me. Twice a week or so (Idk i was like 8), i would go into an office and clap in a rhythm for like 4 hours.....   http://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/video/interactive-metronome-adhd  I can't remember if it actually helped, but i know i have a better concept of rhythmic timing than most other musicians. What i do remember, is that in that damn waiting room, some twisted son of a bitch convinced me to trade my Ampharous, that i slaved over to evolve from a Flaaffy, for his stupid Entei that he renamed "Exodia" and taught like 3 HMs. I treated him like Jon Snow.... That's a two-fer with references. i should get a a medal............  I should probably get back to physics.......

I'm sick and tired of it. I'm tired of being anxious, I'm tired of being unproductive, I'm tired of not having enough time, i'm tired from sleep deprivation, i'm tired of working. (I want to go off meds right now, but i know what will happen)
