c536aa46eb3268a5de88bc73731cf3d71e12a188741be30941be64e88645ef77;;;How should I get accommodations for ACT. Advice?;;;Namely the act. I'm thinking about applying to be able to get extra time and/or marking on the booklet to keep my train of thought. I've been diagnosed for 9 years with bi yearly medchecks for my adderall so I think I'm good in that regard but I haven't had an IEP or 509 plan in school due to teachers being able to work with me when I can't focus or finish a test in time etc. Anyways I'm just looking for advice about how to go about it etc. Thanks!
