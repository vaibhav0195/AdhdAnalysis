I could focus, I felt my memory was better and got rid of the "fogging" effects my other meds caused and I started at a Community College where I have been maintaining a 3.7 GPA. I have state insurance so all the psychs I see only stay for 1 1/2-2 years and are usually just starting out/are young. My current psych has been pushing to take me off Adderall for the last year. When I ask if she thinks I'm "cured" she says no there isn't really a cure...OK. When I ask what I can do after I go off it to improve the symptoms it was controlling, she just said there isn't really anything I can do except for some unproven experimental things (like doing mental math daily, CBT etc.)...OK. She says it's not something that people stay on for more than a few years...OK, so why the fuck do they put us on it in the first place? I'm worried that my old symptoms will come back and I'll suddenly be stupid and forgetful. I can't put it off anymore and we will start reducing next month. Is there anything I can do to prepare? Will my cognitive ability decline? Or even be worse than before? What can I do after I'm completely off?
