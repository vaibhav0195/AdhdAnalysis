It's hard enough trying to get them on board with the whole idea of ADHD (they're only really letting me go private because we are lucky to have insurance), but although people will say get over this hurdle first, then medication, it's something important because we need to factor in any post-diagnosis costs.  After previously being seen to by an adolescent mental health service (NHS), they narrowed it down to anxiety and made clear that my good grades eliminated the possibility of ADHD. My mum claims the lady told her that I wouldn't have medication even if diagnosed because it wouldn't be needed for my severity. A popular post I made here on an old account quickly made me realise that this psychiatrist likely didn't know much about ADHD, which I should have realised after she dismissed it due to good academic performance.  So my main question, I don't understand how it couldn't be "bad enough", and I don't understand how I can get my parents to actually understand and acknowledge the disorder through things like research rather than using pre-empted ideas on what ADHD is. **What can I do about this?** The annoying this I feel like my dad actually has it himself.  &amp;nbsp;  **Slightly off-topic questions:**  - For those of you in the UK who got diagnosed privately, could you switch your medications from private to NHS so you don't have to consistently pay a fortune for them? - If I need to be assessed for comorbid anxiety and ADHD, I assume that I can't just go to a normal ADHD psychiatrist. If anyone has comorbid anxiety and ADHD, could you please tell me what kind of doc you got diagnosed by? Anyone who has done so in the UK would be even better :)
