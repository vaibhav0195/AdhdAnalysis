d59665b1cba0eeb11333091340f691934cc0af18718d291ad0a1df0e2a6822bd;;;My mini rant;;;Stupidly way TL;DR: I feel like I'm lying about having ADHD even though I know I have it. I don't feel supported in my diagnosis and decision to take meds for ADHD.  I have ADHD and social anxiety disorder.   I just had a breakdown on Friday night because of ADHD and social anxiety (pms was also a factor-however we shall choose to overlook this a slight bit please) I was given meds for the first time on Monday-I took them and they made my head feel clear, increased my focusing to kind of absurd/unnecessary levels, my sister said she notices I can speak more smoothly, and I can actually carry on conversations for the first time in my life-without getting bored and tuning out. However I feel my only support is from my twin and a strange type of support from my bf. My parents do not want me medicated (long term effects, being doped up-yes doped up, because it is a depressant right, I don't want you on meds, look how far you've gone without meds...).    For some reason I know I have ADHD, but it is so hard for me to admit it because I feel like a liar. I feel that the lack of support from my parents does not help (even though they can accept the idea of me having ADHD I think) when I went to get tested my  mom told me she doubted I had it, I wasn't hyperactive as a kid or anything. In part I think being 21 and getting diagnosed makes me feel this way. Even when I started I always felt like I was lying even though I wasn't.
