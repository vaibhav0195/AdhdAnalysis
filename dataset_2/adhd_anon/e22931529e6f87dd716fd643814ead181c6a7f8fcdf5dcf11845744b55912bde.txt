What does it mean?;;;So I grew up as a pretty hyper kid like a lot of other children, eventually being diagnosed (although potentially unofficially) by my doctor with ADHD. He suggested I start wearing one of those patches to help around the end of 6th grade. Being a kid I was scared of the patch because I was afraid it would make me different from everyone else or something so I convinced my parents that I could do better in school and that I did not need the patch. The next year I got straight A's. Fast forward to now and I am 20 years old still without medication, doing just fine. Was my doctor wrong? Did I just grow out of it? *Can* one grow out of ADHD or ADD? Anybody else have the same experience? Just curious.
