b87033d8272f7c1f2b14880d4227d2a2b5cc748e7ee125e9fd286e795be7d063;;;Hey /r/ADHD I need some advice.;;;So, I'm a 16 year old male and I've been having some problems lately. I'm to be diagnosed with ADD, I have not been diagnosed yet but it's looking like I will be very soon, but my dad still tells at me for forgetting to do things like tidy my room or clean the shower after use, I honestly just forget. I never use ADD in the arguments because I don't want to use it to my advantage. Any help appreciated.
