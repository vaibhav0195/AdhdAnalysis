Anyways, my medications are making me feel like a zombie.  I've brought this up with my doctor and he said he would monitor it and we could discuss a change next time.  my meds are intuniv, certriline, and wellbutrin.  idk if it is that mix that is making me feel this way?  anyways, I'm wondering if anyone here has done this before and if they could weigh in on it.
