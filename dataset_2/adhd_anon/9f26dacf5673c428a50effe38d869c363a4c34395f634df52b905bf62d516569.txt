I have had ADHD all my life, my sister and mother both have it as well. My mom wouldn't have us diagnosed as kids because she is a hardcore Christian and wouldn't have let us take medication anyways. I am married but my wife is from another country and when I explain my behaviors by pointing to ADHD she finds it hard to believe. I know she kind of understands what the disorder is but it is not diagnosed in her culture, so I get the feeling she think is I am simply making excuses. That upsets me, but I also can see where she is coming from. ADHD almost doesn't exist in her culture. At this age, the small struggles in working an office job are becoming more and more difficult to manage as I progress and I am wondering if there is value to be had in seeking a professional diagnosis at this point. I also have my reservations about being stigmatized in any way if I do seek diagnosis - just being honest. I have dealt well up until now, but I'm interested in opinions on seeking a diagnosis at this point in my life. Would appreciate any input. Cheers! -Jerry
