However, once i told my parents and they said that they dont believe me. I have trouble focusing, i procrastinate a lot, i lose so much stuff, i basically do a lot of add focused stuff. I took many online tests and i watched a lot of videos on add and adhd. I just have so much similar symptoms. Except, the thing is, when i tell my parents about adhd, they said that im just lazy and i need to force myself to focus. I told them about meds and this is what they said "no child of mine will take meds!" I told my doctor and she said that if i had adhd, she would know by now. I have had the same doctor since i was 3! Im 14 now. My doctor is chinese so if that makes any difference. How do i convince them just to do a simple test? Its just super embarrasing to talk to my doctor and my parents arent any different. :/  TL;DR My parents and doctor dont think i have adhd but i think i do
