I desperately want these meds to work, and I've been trying so hard to give it my all alongside the meds.  I feel this is my last chance - if I'm not able to make these meds work, I feel I'll be resigned to a life of self-disappointment.    At my current dose, the effects are very subtle, if noticeable at all.  I'm having trouble discerning if it is actually helping me.  * *How long should I take Adderall before coming to a conclusion its efficacy?* * *How do you know if the medications are working?* * *Should I ask my psychiatrist to ask for a bump in dose?* * *If so, how do I avoid looking like a drug seeker?*  **TL;DR: How do you know when Adderall IR is working for you?  How do you arrive at the appropriate dosage? How soon should you adjust the dosage?**
