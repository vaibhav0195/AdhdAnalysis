I've been on medication for roughly 3 years and no matter what stimulant drug i use, the results tend to be the same.   When i'm off my medication its like i turn into a comedian, i can make people laugh really easily without even thinking as well as laughing a lot more in general about situations/thoughts/peoples behaviors. Talking to people is a lot easier as i just impulsively say whatever is on my mind, i can think of witty responses in an instant. In class i become a stand up comedian, and the students as well as the teacher become my audience. Sometimes i'll say something funny impulsively without even thinking/realizing why people would find it funny in the first place. Overall i'd say my school day is a lot more enjoyable off my medication, i just feel a lot happier. Although when i get home and i'm alone i'd say i'm a lot less happy because the reality of my academic situation hits me, but overall i'd say the day is a lot more fun.    Now of course, while i'm off my meds my grades plummet, my sleep cycle goes to shit and not a whole lot gets accomplished. So i have to take my medication to get my grades back on track. On my medication its a lot harder for me to empathize with people, sometimes people in general just make me irritable. Its like instead of everything they do making me laugh, everything they do just pisses me off. I hardly laugh on medication, and people just seem foreign and the amount of things to talk about seems nil to slim. I do get my work done instead of lolly gagging  in class, so thats a plus.    So i guess the reason i made this post: has anyone experienced the same thing? how do you deal with it? How can i find a balance between social butterfly and robot?
