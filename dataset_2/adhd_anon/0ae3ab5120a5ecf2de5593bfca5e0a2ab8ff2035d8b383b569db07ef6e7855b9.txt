I've never come to the conclusion that I could have ADHD. Now I'm trying to find what's wrong with me. My psychiatrist refuses to diagnose me, but from what I've read, it's obvious that I have ADHD. My mom is very supportive yet she thinks I'm hopeless. I've been like this my entire life, and I am starting to believe her. I'm boxed in psychologically, physically, financially, etc. I can't go anywhere because I don't have any money. My insurance does not allow me decent care. I am obligated to stay below  $1364 per month to retain my "health care". I have begun taking the generic for Adderall XR, which really helps. All I know is that I can't stay here; my future depends on it! As far as employment goes, I've lost count of how many jobs I've had. I've tried to retrain for a different field (academic portion did great, clinical experience not so much). Pursuing Vocational Rehab currently; I know there is something I can do or retrain for  to support myself. I could ramble on forever but I must get to bed. Thanks for any assistance. Have a great day.
