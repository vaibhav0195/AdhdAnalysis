Is anyone willing to answer a few questions?;;;A bit of background: I was diagnosed PDD-NOS as a kid, was reevaluated around 14yrs old and given an autism diagnosis, and now apparently I have ADHD too. And "moderate" anxiety. And "moderate" depression. I'm actually quite amused at how screwed up my brain is.  Anyways, I have a few questions about ADHD and a few related things.  My psychologist told me that fish oil could help. I did a bit of research but couldn't find much reputable evidence in support of fish oil as a treatment, and [this article](http://adhdrollercoaster.org/adhd-medication/fish-oil-and-adhd-what-is-the-evidence/) seems to indicate that it's only useful for a subset of people with ADHD (if it's even useful). Does anyone know if there's reputable research on the subject?  My psychologist also told me that medication was not very effective - it looks like he was referencing [the study discussed in this article](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323368704578593660384362292). Is there any merit to this argument? What are the proven benefits to medication, if any?  I also have a bit of a dilemma. I'm willing to try medication if it could actually help with my various ADHD symptoms, but my mother is rather strongly against them (although rather ironically she doesn't raise an eyebrow at the amount of caffeine I consume). Is it worth pressing the issue, or should I wait until next fall when I'll be in university to consider the medication option?  I have mixed feelings over the medication issue... I want to try it, but I feel like a junkie for wanting to try it... I don't even want it for academic reasons, my grades are fairly good... It's just the thoughts, the endless torrent of them... The lack of motivation... Constantly being distracted by trivial things... I want something that could help, but I'm also conflicted over if wanting to take drugs to reduce these symptoms is really important when I've managed them for 18 years *without* drugs... I don't really know how to explain *why* I'm so conflicted coherently... I think this ties into my avoidance of disability resources so far... I really, really want to believe that I don't need "help" to succeed, and I feel like both disability resources and drugs would be cheating in a way precisely because I'm *already* able to meet the standard and produce reasonably high quality work, at least so far in high school and community college classes.
