0877848235f7f8a7defc02c61d8f6498527da86cac0600cf986b4e546a10d3b4;;;Just started Strattera. I really don't like it. Anyone else have these side effects?;;;I've been on Strattera for about 2 weeks (10mg), after being professionally diagnosed with adult ADHD. My psychiatrist said that it would be a good place to start in medication, since I have anxiety issues, and take lexapro (15mg) . I am a 19 year old, 5'10", 215lb, male, and I really don't feel any improvement in confidence, focus, hyperactivity (jittery, and figetty and stuff), memory, and everything that gave me problems. Instead I'm extremely aggressive (i'm a very mellow guy) , my blood pressure has shot up, I'm nauseous constantly, can barely eat, having insomnia (i've been up for 3 days), and having hallucinations? (I'm seeing moving shadows, even when there is no item, or person there. Like the shadows aren't on the floor, they're in front of me and stuff).   Melatonin has not helped at all with sleep (I'm taking like 20mg, which I think is alot, and it hasn't affected me at all).    Are these normal side effects? or should I immediately quit and what would you recommend? I'm interested about asking for adderall, since I hear that it does wonders for people with focus, and memory problems. What do you guys think?  TLDR: Side effects are pretty bad, with no improvement. Thinking about switching to adderall. Opinions?  Thanks everyone.
