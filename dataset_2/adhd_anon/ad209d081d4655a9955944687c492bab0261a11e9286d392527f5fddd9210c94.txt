I've seen quite a few "Xmg didn't work for me, so I took two pills, three, pills, etc... and now I'm worried about (insert problem here)" threads lately.   No matter how smart you think you are, YOU ARE NOT YOUR DOCTOR. If you feel your meds aren't working as well as they should, then bring it up with your psych/GP/NP, etc... They should be the ones to have a better solution. They need you to be honest with them, so they can use that insight to properly treat you. We cannot diagnose you, we also cannot give you medical advice.   Your doctor has spent years, more than you ever will, in the field of medicine. They are trained, educated to know about diseases, drugs, symptoms, side effects, etc... You are not. Do not deviate from your prescribed dose, do not take more than you should. It is illegal to take more than what's written on your bottle without your doctor's consent.  These are powerful, addicting drugs. They are also very effective at managing your condition, with medical supervision. That prescription authorizes you to possess/take only the dose specified because your "supervisor" judged it to be appropriate for you. No more than that. So stop pretending you know what's best for you, and let your doctor treat you with the expertise they have.   TL;DR Stop taking more meds than what your doctor told you.
