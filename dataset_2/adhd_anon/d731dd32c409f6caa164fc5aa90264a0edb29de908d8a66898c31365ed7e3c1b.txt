d731dd32c409f6caa164fc5aa90264a0edb29de908d8a66898c31365ed7e3c1b;;;Manipulative relationship or medication issue;;;I've been in a relationship with a girl I met online that has a history of substance abuse and eating disorders. I am diagnosed ADHD and took my Adderall IR 20 mg medication for school and ended up taking too many at one point and battling anxiety and depression. I need to prepare for the bar exam and she tells me that the medication changes the way I look and my personality. I have been on and off Lexapro 10 mg to go along with the Adderall but I don't think it is necessary as she may be the cause of my anxiety. Does taking Adderall everyday really change ones appearence and personality? It works the best for me as far as enabling me to focus and achieve things, but I don't know if I'm bipolar or just in a bad relationship. Anyone have similar experience? Thank you!
