I'm seeing a psychiatrist tomorrow where I'm likely to be diagnosed with ADHD-PI. I have been informally diagnosed with it by my primary care physician last summer and was put on Concerta which did next to nothing for my inattentiveness, lethargy, lack of motivation and repetitive loopy mind clutter (my main symptoms). I know every reacts to prescriptions differently and I'll eventually get what I needed dialed in. But is it common for,say, Concerta, to have zero affect and then have Vyvanse or another similar drug have an actual affect? What were your experiences in finding the right medication for your PI?
