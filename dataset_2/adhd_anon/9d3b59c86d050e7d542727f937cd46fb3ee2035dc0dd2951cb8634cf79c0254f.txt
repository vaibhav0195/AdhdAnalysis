I want to make it clear that i am NOT trying to abuse adderall for weight loss, but I definitely won't turn my nose up at that side effect.  I'm curious, though. I hear people lose weight, but I have no idea if, on average, it's 2lbs or 20lbs. I know everyone is different, but for those of you who have taken adderall, how much weight have you lost? Were you able to maintain it?  I am a 24 yr old girl, 5'9", 165. I run almost daily - not far, but consistently. I'm on 5mg x 3 daily. I'm really curious to see what this does to my body..
