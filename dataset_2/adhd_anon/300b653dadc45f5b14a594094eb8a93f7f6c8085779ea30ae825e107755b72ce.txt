I came across a post a while back of someone going on a Keto diet to combat their ADHD tendencies.  Has anyone tried, and what affect did it have on the medication. Debating trying as I'm on a very low dose of ritalin as we dial in the concentration after switching to a long release formulation, and maybe it would allow me to work back up at full pace.
