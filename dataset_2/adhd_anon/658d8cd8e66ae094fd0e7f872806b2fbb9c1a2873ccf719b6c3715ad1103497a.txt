658d8cd8e66ae094fd0e7f872806b2fbb9c1a2873ccf719b6c3715ad1103497a;;;One of the biggest difficulties I've had with ADHD;;;I was diagnosed with adhd pretty young (6 years old or so) and obviously have had it my whole life. One of the biggest things I struggle with is an internal struggle where I'm trying to define Which of my wrongdoings are the adhd and which are just me. It is always in the back of my head when doing homework or something else and I lose track and just end up not doing things, It is always itching at the back of my head that is just my fault in the end. That the adhd does not really contribute. Sadly, I've gone without any medication(lack of insurance) for a few years now and have struggled with failing grades(got expelled this semester for low GPA) and impulsive behavior(has ended several friendships, and has gotten me fired before).  Recently aplyed for medical so hopefully I can get my medication. But do you guys struggle with the same (what is and is not my fault) mental debates?
