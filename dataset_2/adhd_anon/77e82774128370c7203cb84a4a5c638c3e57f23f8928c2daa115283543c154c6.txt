I just started ritalin last weekish sometime. Wow, such focus. But seriously though, it's been incredible. I got to a place called the Affinity center in Cincinnati. They've taken EXCELLENT care of me. I meet with my therapist once a week, who talks to the doctor there once a week. I see the same doctor every 3-4 weeks. My overall ritalin experience has been eye opening.  So 20mg ritalin, and I'm prescribed it 3 times a day. So in one day I take 60mg. I typically save my questions for the doctor, but sometimes I feel like I'm being withheld information. Not on purpose mind you, I just feel like maybe I'm not getting the whole story. Since January I've been taking zoloft and mirtazapine. Antidepressant/ sleep aid.   Is there anyone else who has taken/ has concerns about any of these three medicines? 1. Mirtazapine 2. Zoloft and 3. Ritalin. Mainly ritalin.  My question is mainly this: what are some risks I may not know about? I mean when I go to the affinity center, the doctor takes my blood pressure and weight then basis everything off of that and how I feel. Am I not asking enough questions? Should I be concerned?  The ritalin for example. To be honest, I don't know many risks that come with it. This is mainly a feedback post, so I'm just looking for support, opinions, and feedback. What are some things that I may not know about any of this?   Tl;dr: 21 yo male w/ questions about meds. search for the question marks. just looking for feedback and support. I talk to my doctor this wednesday, so I will be bringing up anything that may seem super helpful here. thx everyone, i really appreciate it.
