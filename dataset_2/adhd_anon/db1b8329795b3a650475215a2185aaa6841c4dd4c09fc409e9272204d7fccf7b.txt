Every time the exact same thing happens and I try to rationalize why and resolve to do things differently this time. In the past, I've had an almost charmed life in regards to this. But I have a sinking feeling my luck is about to run out.  I've been procrastinating. On a lot of important things, but primarily it's the ten page paper I have to finish in less than five days which I've done no research for in a class where I barely have a C. I can't bullshit my way out of this one, so now I have to read three full biographies in less than four days and finish a ten page paper.   I can't help but hate and loathe my own laziness and the self indulgence that led to this situation which I'm sure many of you have also experienced at one point or another. I know negative thoughts are bad for me, but I can't shut them out.   Getting this all down somewhere does help a little, but I still have this massive problem of my own making to deal with. That doesn't even take into account the presentation that's due five days later in another class I've been neglecting. And then it's finals time.   tl;dr I'm pretty fucked and it's absolutely my fault.

It's like I'm hanging on for dear life.   I have paper due last week that I need to have done by friday and i haven't started. I have another paper due by the end of the month. I've barely attended class this semester and I'm pretty sure I have a pot problem.  I don't go out. I'm a shut in. What few friends I have seem like they're continents away. I feel sick constantly. I'm on the edge of a complete meltdown from the self inflicted stress. I want to scream right now but class is starting. First time I've come in more than a week.  Fuck me, is it even possible to change?
