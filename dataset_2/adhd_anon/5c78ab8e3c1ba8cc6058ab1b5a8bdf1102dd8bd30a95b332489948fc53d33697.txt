5c78ab8e3c1ba8cc6058ab1b5a8bdf1102dd8bd30a95b332489948fc53d33697;;;Mental pain/ emptiness;;;I haven't seen anyone else describe it this way but anyone feel like a mental pain when not on meds? It used to be the case even before diagnosis and even now between meds.. And even during meds but to a lesser degree.  Its like an emptiness and it makes you want to smash your head against something, to feel something, anything than this gaping nothingness.  Its not even like the sheer hopelessness that comes from depression but utter emptiness.   It seems its called Anhedonia, an inability to derive pleasure from things.  Anyone else have it and know how to deal with it?
