I want to know if anyone else here feels as if they are in what I can only describe as a permanent dream-like state. It is not necessarily mental exhaustion, inability to think clearly, tiredness or euphoria (although I often feel those too after intensive work and they only manage to worsen the effect). Maybe it is what you all describe as "Brain fog" but I am still unsure. The lucidity of it intensifies as the day goes on, being at its weakest in the morning and being at its strongest when I go to bed.    I can only describe it as: "feeling as though I am in a dream to the point that I feel like things around me aren't real and that I am disconnected from reality." It's the kind of odd, lucid feeling that I, and I imagine other people, use to check if they are actually dreaming (if that makes any sense, the sort of sensation "check" to see if things are "real".) It feels exactly like that, but less intense.   I could feel it seeping in when I was in grade-school, I was medicated back then, and it has been with me since. I remember taking actual notice as to how different I felt, even describing it to my parents as feeling as if I was on drugs. I've had this sensation so long, that I have forgotten what it is like to feel normal, and I even sometimes forget that it is even there.   Do other people feel this too? Is it actually linked to ADHD and, if it is, is there anything I can do to make myself feel better? Is this at all similar to Derealization disorder? I hate to sound melodramatic here, but I often feel as if people and things around me aren't real. Do you think this "disconnect" is at all linked with dysthymia, lack of motivation, social anxiety, lack of empathy and even sapped mental ability?   Thoughts?
