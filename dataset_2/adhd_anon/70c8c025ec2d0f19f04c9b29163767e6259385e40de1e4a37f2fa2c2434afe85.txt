I usually erase everything before posting. I still doubt whether I am posting in the right subreddit but this time, I will do it and I will post it because no one I know have ADHD and I would really appreciate any feedback or similar stories.     I live with ADHD-PI, was diagnosed in 2008, I am on Adderall XR 30mg since middle of 2010, but can't afford therapy yet.   I have little to no interest in my success at school. I couldn't care less about computer science.   I work in retail and, even though I really love my job, I fear that I will get stuck in it forever if I quit school.  I alienated and lost all my friends a few years ago and, while I still have some acquaintances, I have trouble finding people who I can relate to. When I do, I often feel I am way more interested than they are. I feel clingy.  When I get back from school/work I mostly browse Reddit. It used to be Facebook, but I deleted it. When I am in a relationship, I like to cook, shop, hike, go to the movies and much much more. Single, I can't find the will to do any of that. I have no daily hobbies, no projects and I haven't delved into any of my interests.   I am having trouble getting interested in my own well-being.  **Edit : Consensus**  * Get psychiatrist * Talk to psychiatrist about possibility of depression and anxiety * Ask about possible medication * Get therapy, it's worth it * Rekindle passion with whatever I used to be passionate about / Find new hobbies * Meet people through said hobbies  Thank you, you guys are awesome. I really should interact with the Internet more, it feels great.
