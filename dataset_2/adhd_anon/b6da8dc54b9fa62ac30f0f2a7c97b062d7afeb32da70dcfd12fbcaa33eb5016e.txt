b6da8dc54b9fa62ac30f0f2a7c97b062d7afeb32da70dcfd12fbcaa33eb5016e;;;Never "tested" for ADHD, Diagnosed by my GP and now I'm too far away (college) to visit him for Vyvanse refills. What can I do?;;;My family doctor diagnosed me with ADD and has been writing me prescriptions for Vyvanse for the last 10 months. However, now I'm away for school and in two months I'm gonna run out of meds before I can make a trip back home.   My college's doctors won't write prescriptions without a formal ADD test. I've been told this test is four hours long and requires a week without meds. I'm in honors engineering, I can't afford to miss a day of classes for this test, or to go without meds for a week.  I recently just got tested for narcolepsy, and am awaiting the results. Vyvnase has been helping me manage the sleepiness, so if I am diagnosed with Narcolepsy (or if I qualify for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) I might still be able to get Vvanse through the college doctors with this diagnoses. Otherwise I will have to find an off-campus doctor to get Vyvanse prescriptions from.   So I guess I have a few questions:  **1) Did you get formally "tested" for ADD/ADHD? Or were you just diagnosed by your GP or a psychiatrist? Which one?**  **2) How likely is it that will I be able to find a doctor to write me prescriptions for Vyvanse in my new city just for the school year? Do you think they're going to require this formal test?**   If you've had this problem, or if you have even a minor solution, any help would be appreciated!  **TL;DR:** Is it likely I can go to a new doctor just to get ADD med's refilled, without getting a formal test, if I've been on the medication for 10 months..?  **UPDATE:** My results from the sleep study are that I am officially Narcoleptic. Yay! (I think?). The treatment for narcolepsy is stimulants. I see my GP tomorrow morning, and I might be prescribed a whole new medicine, or I might stay on my Vyvanse. I go back to school in 3 days, and hopefully an official diagnosis of narcolepsy with some sort of ADD/stimulant medicine such as Vyvanse prescribed as treatment will let the University doctors continue to fill my prescriptions when I can't get back to my GP.  It's kinda stupid that the only way I can get my University to treat me for ADD is by treating me for Narcolepsy. *sigh
