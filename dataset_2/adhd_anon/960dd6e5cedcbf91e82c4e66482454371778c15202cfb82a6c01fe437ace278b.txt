It was a good relationship and we were very much in love. At some point during our relationship, I noticed things about him that could be the symptoms of ADHD, so I suggested to him that he bring it up with his therapist. He did, and was referred to a psychiatrist, who officially daignosed him and prescribed Vyvanse and the generic form of Lexapro. Within weeks of him starting these medications, his feelings toward me changed. He went from loving me to deciding we needed to go on a break. We did, but a month after that, he decided it wasn't working, and we broke things off, but remained friends. I'm still trying to wrap my head around it, because it was so drastic. He even admitted that he felt his meds had changed something. There was nothing wrong in our relationship that would have otherwise changed things so drastically. It's been almost 2 months since we broke up, and while it may be too late to try to fix it, I was wondering, could his meds have affected his feelings that much, and if he stopped taking them, would his feelings return? Would it be worth it for him to talk to his psychiatrist about it if it might affect future relationships?
