9da47166659b90fd64d576221c30e8ccee3e90f98c3af8efbc15270b3cf26b34;;;An Update from last post.;;;So I wanted to update since my last post.  http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/320dkm/so_this_just_went_down/  So I have been working on getting a referral to Focus, M.D. only to be told,   "No, we don't want to do that right now, how bout you come in for an intake appointment. It seems you have been on and off your meds, and function fine, so come in so we can make sure you were diagnosed correctly."  Oh yes, absolutely, I must not have ADHD cause I do not get in trouble at work so nothing is really reportable as not "fine." Not to mention the fact I have been becoming more and more addicted to coffee now that I realize how much it helps me focus in leiu of stimulant medication. 4 cups in the A.M. and I can get my work done. Not hyper, not jumping out of my seat with excitment. Focused, getting work done.  It is getting annoying, but hey, I tried right? I mean hell, I have seen these people here and there, and none of the ones I have been told to talk to are ones I have seen before, so how do they know just how "fine" I am? I am so annoyed.  Sorry if this comes of ranty, but I really feel I can express my fustrations here more than I can elsewhere, and I like you guys. Fo' Sho. So thanks. :-) Yea.  Oh, and I got an extension on my school work, and have a 24 hour duty tonight. Totally borrowed the keurig from work to drink coffee all night and finish all my late work.  tl;dr: Update on Focus, M.D. referral, which got shot down, people here suck, say I am fine, and thank you guys for letting me rant about dumb stuff.
