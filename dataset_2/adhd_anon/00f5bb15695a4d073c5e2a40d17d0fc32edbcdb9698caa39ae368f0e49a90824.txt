Thank you in advance for all your help - this sub has been such a help and relief for me over the past few months.  Backstory: I'm 25. Got diagnosed with ADHD in May after I started having severe stomach problems. Drinking 6 cups of coffee a day to function (self-medication) was taking it's toll. Started on adderall IR. First 10, then 20, then 30, then 35, then back to 25 and now been at around 30-35 a day. I take 15-20 in AM and 15 in PM at 1. I have a comedown around 5pm (lose all motivation, get really introverted, face feels hot) so I normally head home despite having more work to do. Drink a cup of coffee around 6 to get me thru the evening and then bed around 11.  Adderall lasts me roughly 3-4 hours, unfortunately. I read a bit of XR and decided to ask my doc for it. He has now given me 20mg XR and a 15mg booster IR in the afternoon, which I'll start tomorrow. He said XR should last roughly 8-10 hours. I want to avoid the comedown which is why i asked for the IR booster - I get so introverted that I cancel my night plans with friends just to sit at home. Really not good...especially because pre-adderall i was never introverted.  - How long do you find XR lasts? - How's the comedown? Do you have it? - Do you prefer taking IR and then XR in late morning, or XR then IR booster? - How do you drink coffee? Or do you not? &lt;-- I can't decide if I should have a cup then XR, or XR then a cup...i just want to make sure I only have roughly 1-1.5 cups a day, max - How's ur mood balance/stability in comparison to xr and IR?  He's given me 20mg XR + 15mg IR because he thought XR would give me 20mg in my body for 10 hours...but it's basically two 10mg IRs (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2547091/) so im sure ill be back in a few days asking for 30mg XR lol  Advice/help?

TDLR: I have terrible emotional control and am looking for advice to maintain my relationship.  I am a 26 y/o male. I was diagnosed with ADHD last year (25). I've been very successful in school and work, but I struggle to maintain close relationships. I do not have many close friends, and I become a burden on everyone that I've dated.   My mom recently told me that growing up, every time I was upset, I would fume aggressively (terrible emotional control) and ex-communicate them for a few days, completely shutting off. Then I would resume as if nothing was wrong a few days later.  This is happening in my adult romantic relationships. I read too much into things that don't exist - for example, when my BF doesn't respond quickly via text. I know he is busy at work logically, but something randomly sets me off and I go on a long rant about how upset I am, or I become passive aggressive. I know he cares deeply for me, but I attempt to push him away (?) and cannot control the emotion that appears.  Almost all of my romantic partners have left me because of this. I want to change, but when the emotion pops up it's so difficult for me to think of anything else. Are there any articles you can suggest, or books, or advice you can give to help me? I want be stable emotionally....and provide support to my partner so he knows he can rely on me.
