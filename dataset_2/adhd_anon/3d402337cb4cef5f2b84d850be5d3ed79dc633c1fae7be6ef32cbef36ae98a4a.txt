Any help woukd be appreciated;;;I've been under ADHD treatment for almost a year and while this is definitely the most productive year of my life ever, i feel unmotivated. Im in my junior year working towards a bachelor, and should really be 100% focused on school. Ive consciously kept my distance from poetential distractions,  but sometines i just dont want to do the work. Im not sure if its Adhd or if Im just expecting the adderall to work like magic.  Any suggestions or tips on how to cope?

Both therapists and psychiatrist insists i am no such thing and ADHD is the root cause of the characteristic i identify to be "lazy".   The thing is though, after a year of Adderall+Wellbutrin i know now what it feels like to focus, and even still knowing i can no focus longer on things i never befrecould i get overwhelmed by this childish "I DONT WANNA" attitude. I feel doomed. Idk what to do.
