d559de5121e80873955e41c62e1bfffa0b9d681567780ec9ee0afe8efb1390bb;;;Is this correct or not?;;;please forgive me if this is not allowed.  so im 14m , almost 15m.  ive been trying to get my parents to take me to a adhd doctor (pschyatrist). they, at first did not believe me. I've been experiencing the symptoms since i was 10/11 but i left it thinking that i should just work harder but about 7 months back i did research and i presume i have adhd, but they just shrug it off.   they keep saying socialize more, get some friends and do sports, the thoughts of adhd will go away. i am somewhat extremely introverted and prefer to be home and do things like configure operating systems and research things on the internet. i do not do a lot of interaction outdoor.   i do  have few friends (not too close with) and i do not go out with them (because im introverted and theyre also somewhat introverted)  then today i went to a therapist in my country(my country does not have doctors with adhd as far as ik but my parents might take me abroad To get checked after convincing them) and idk if he is even aware of adhd. he just told me 3 things after i explained what i said : be a man, do exercise, interact with others and you'll be fine.   my question is, is this right? does socializing and doing sports get rid of my adhd? i've been experiencing the symptoms a lot but they just keep saying the same thing "be positive", "you are normal nothing is wrong with you dont make yourself abnormal", "do sports and socialize these thoughts will go away"
