d04580079dbe2139a43853370477eca7ec38181fbe21ade4ce49ec6009f1acd2;;;Going in for formal diagnosis. Wish me luck!;;;I first heard about adhd 3 weeks ago. Since then i was lucky  enough to go trough 3  gp, 2 psychologist, 1 psychiatrist. Those who knew about ADHD strongly suspected, but  couldnt formally diagnose.  Miraculasly, i am sitting in a lobby of a adult ADHD professional waiting for my evaluation to start. I dont have report cards, wasnt diagnosed as a child, and my parents speek foreign language. Additionaly i managed to finish University  (3 degrees) and worked for 7 years at one place. There was a lot of reasons why I could do it, but it sounds non typical.   Please wish me luck, i will accept any diagnosis  and move on.
