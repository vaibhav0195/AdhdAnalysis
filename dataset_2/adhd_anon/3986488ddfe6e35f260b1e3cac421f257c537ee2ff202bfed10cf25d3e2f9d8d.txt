Am I expecting too much to think this could be the "first day of the rest of my life?";;;I finally decided to have a real talk with my doctor and we both decided it was time to try medication.  I was apprehensive at first, because I'm very sensitive to medications.  I can't even take cold medicine for adults without feeling really weird.  Now, I'm so excited to try this.  I feel like I might finally be able to function like a real person for the first time.  Am I building up my expectations too much?  I'm starting out on a low dose, then will build up in a month, if appropriate.  I suppose I'm looking for other's experiences when first beginning a new medication for ADHD as an adult.
