I am also posting my story, yes I'm seeking advice, but I'm more using this as a medium to vent my frustration ;). **So don't feel the need to read all of this** I'll do my best to keep your focus.  10mg adderall is finally kicking in but I should be studying for a huge exam tomorrow morning.  Anyway, growing up I was a creative child, I loved tinkering with toys and taking apart anything to figure out how it worked... but school was never easy. I never EVER paid attention in class, there was something in my brain that made me physically hurt to try to focus.. I could never study, but I was a creative kid that liked to have fun and do things I wanted to do.  But I was never diagnosed with anything.. as I was able to slip by with passing grades, however much it hurt to do so.  Fast forward to senior year of high school (6 years ago). BOOM, what do I have? stage 4 cancer! yay! Although I wish I never had cancer, I get a lot of pride knowing what I am capable of, and during those 6 months of chemo, I learned a lot about myself. As a result of the cancer, a lot of PTSD came with it :/.  I was luckily able to graduate high school on time by taking online classes.. which sucked and if it wasn't for my mom writing my papers, I wouldn't have graduated. I've had great support, when I had cancer, my mom did ALL of my college applications for me.  Which brings me to the next part of my life story (I would be surprised if anyone is still reading, I want to work on my story telling skills, but i'm keeping it brief). I was accepted to a big 10 university, a big 4 year party school. I had applied for the college of engineering (WHY) but didn't get in. Thanks to my Mom, she talked to the admissions counselor and I was then admitted to the college of engineering. THIS is all before I started any medication.. So here I am, a cancer-surviving freshman who is in denial about his ADHD enrolled in an advanced engineering program at a nationally ranked school (How the hell did this happen?)   Can anyone guess what happened by freshman year? I failed... HARD.. I failed pre-calc.. PRE-CALC. I did so poorly I had to apply to get back into school. I had thought about taking a year off and finding who I was.. but I had a feeling that I would never go back to school (or engineering for that matter). Something had to change, and one day my mom decided she would take me to a doctor.. she told the doctor about my problems paying attention, I filled out a random form and he reads over it and says "BY GOLLY, you have ADHD!" (not quite) but I am prescribed 30MG of vyvanse, and I'm incredibly eager and optimistic if that is exactly what I need to turn my life around.  And it was! (Kind of) Yes, this is my fifth year of college right now, and I'm set to graduate in May with a degree in computer engineering, and minors in computer science and mathematics (I made pre-calc my bitch), I made honors last semester, and I know the rest will be a breeze.   On one hand, medication saved my life.. I am in a great position to become an incredibly productive member of society.. But I feel I'm doomed to have to take medication for the rest of my life.   On the other hand Vyvanse (FUCKING EVIL DRUG) really gave my some screwed up anxiety, I have a lot less (from low dose adderall) but that year that I took vyvanse was worse than when I had cancer.. the anxiety, depression, loss of sex drive, loss of being able to be social.  I'm worried that I will have to take medication for the rest of my life.. even though I'm currently on a low dose of adderall (10 - 30mg) I still have a good amount of anxiety. I started taking anti-anxiety medication 6 months ago to help with it (lexapro) and it helps, but it also comes with side-effects.  I really need to go start studying.  **TL;DR: I would love to reach a point in my life when I am free from all medication but I feel like that may not happen for a long time. Long term users, how has medication affected your life??** **  **
