The first week I was instructed to take 18mg, then 36mg the following week, etc.. (until I find the right dosage).  This week was the 36mg week, and the first 2 days were kinda OK, but on the 3rd day my heart started pounding strongly I was feeling my heartbeat in an uncomfortable way, and it was the same way the 4th day (yesterday). So my psychiatrist told me to stop taking it today and see a cardiologist.  Has anyone had similar problems with Concerta that vanished after a while?   I didn't really realize the effect it had on me until today that I stopped taking it. It didn't help me focus as much as I thought it would (the doc did tell me that 36 mg is not a large dose for an 80kg adult), but without it I seem to get tired/sleepy very quickly and I find it hard to do homework.
