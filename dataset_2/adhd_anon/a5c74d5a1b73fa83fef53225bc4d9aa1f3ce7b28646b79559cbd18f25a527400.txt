a5c74d5a1b73fa83fef53225bc4d9aa1f3ce7b28646b79559cbd18f25a527400;;;My good news;;;I tend to ramble so this will be brief. Since I was diagnosed in April 2014, I have had 2 promotions and 2 raises. Not that it means anything outside my company, but I started my job April 2012 at 10.50 US an hour, moved to the billing department in April 2013 and went up to 11.50 and stayed here until my next yearly raise in April to 12.50. Since I was diagnosed in April 2014, I have had 2 promotions and 2 raises and now make 15.50 an hour. I work on my own, no metrics or quota really, I just have to stay ahead of the numbers, thats it. Without my diagnosis and treatment, Id still be exactly where I was before I got help.  I'm really happy about it and wanted to share it with you guys. Thanks for reading. :)
