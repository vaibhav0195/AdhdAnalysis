And where did you go to get tested?  I am 20 years old and convinced that I have it. It all started last semester in college. My roommate is a psychology major and he was learning about frontal lobe function and disorders. He told me about this game called The Tower of Hanoi (look it up if you don't know what it is). He said that an inability to solve the puzzle within a certain amount of moves could indicate a frontal lobe problem. I played the game and it took me 240 moves to solve it with 6 rings. The optimal amount of moves to solve it is around 60.I tried again and again with similar results so it wasn't just a bad first try. This is what first concerned me because of how badly I performed.  A few months later I'm still a little concerned but have mostly forgotten about it. Then I go to Charlestown, SC with my buddies and my job was to keep track of the camera bag. I failed miserably and left it behind three times in various places. I did some googling and figured out that ADD/ADHD is a disorder of the frontal lobe.  This got me thinking about it again and I've realized that I am very forgetful, chronically late to everything, I find it very hard to concentrate while reading or listening to conversation, I find it hard to finish projects, am a super procrastinator, and am constantly misplacing things. My parents tell me I'm lazy and irresponsible. I think back to the time when I figured out I needed glasses. I didn't notice that my vision was bad until someone told that I should be able to see the projector from the second row of desks and I got glasses. I don't want something like ADD to hold me back unnecessarily because I'm not diagnosed, like when i got glasses. What do I do?   tl;dr I think I have ADD/ADHD what is the next step?
