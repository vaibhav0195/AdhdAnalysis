After my brother and I were diagnosed, and after long discussions between the three of us, he has started the process of getting checked himself.  He has been smoking and drinking coffee for most of his adult life, and seems especially reliant in stressful situations (maybe not that uncommon in terms of smokers and coffee drinkers). I recently came to think that this might have something to do with the possible undiagnosed condition that he might be struggling with.  I have myself used caffeinated drinks extensively, and found them to be useful at times, but after starting on medication I have not found that much of a need for them.  Have any of you found a similar outcome from medicine, after being diagnosed? I suspect that coffee or smokes might not be as necessary in ones daily life if the medicine takes away the primary problem.  I hope that my father finds out about the source of his problems, and that he might find an escape from the addictions he has been trying to get ridd of.  **TL;DR**: Is it common for ADHD/ADD sufferers to become reliant on caffeine or nicotine to combat their disability, perhaps while they don't know of the underlying problem?
