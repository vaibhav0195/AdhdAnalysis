But, I was curious if anyone who also suffers from ADHD has issues with changing your mind regarding just about anything? In particular it really affects my interests. I may be very interested in "Hobby A", but might wake up the next morning and be completely disinterested and decided to move on to "Hobby B". It seems that I can't ever get good at anything because for whatever reason as soon as I make a little progress I seem to do a 180 and lose all interest. It's frustrating to no end.
