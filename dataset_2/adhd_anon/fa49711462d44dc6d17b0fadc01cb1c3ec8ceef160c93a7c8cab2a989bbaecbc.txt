Its been a rough couple of months, dropped out of college a year ago, and now am going back in (scared as shit). I have the support of my mother's side of the family, but my father's side has been clueless,  they don't offer much help cause they dont believe in ADHD. I have also general anxiety and just managed to get out of a severe depression, that motivated me to start drinking heavily, smoking cigs and using cocaine although not regularly, but still. I am determined to turn my life around. I just wanted a few words of inspiration and maybe a few tips or trick from you guys so I can get up and overcome this. Thanks in advance guys, and hello from Puerto Rico!
