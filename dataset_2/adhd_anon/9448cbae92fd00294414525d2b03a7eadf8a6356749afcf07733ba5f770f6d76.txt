All this technology that surrounds us day in day out can become so distracting and detrimental to our wellbeing. I recently purchased an android phone, which means I'll basically always be connected somehow. What if we could utilize it to make us more productive? Using apps to our advantage to remind us of things that need to be done, and helping us plan put our day so that we don't find ourselves on Reddit at 5 in the afternoon when we had an assignment due today?   I'm aware that there is already a plethora of apps capable of doing this for us. Does the community here know of any amazing ones that could help us become more productive?   I've realised that my current predicament is not one that I am content with. Without some sort of drastic change, I'm not going to achieve anything amazing in my life. If I find a way to plan out everything I need to do for the day, and by plan out I mean plan out *meticulously* maybe i can manage to finally do what needs to be done? I realise that apps themselves aren't going to put the effort in for me, but a lot of the time i find the problem to actually be that I don't realise I have a shit to do. If I'm reminded constantly (by myself!), and I find the motivation to get off my butt and complete the task at hand, who knows what is achievable?   It's late and I'm rambling quite a bit, but I hope everyone can understand what I'm getting at.
