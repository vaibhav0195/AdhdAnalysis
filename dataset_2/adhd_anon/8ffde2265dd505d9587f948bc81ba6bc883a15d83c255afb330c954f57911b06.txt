I'm currently working at a Tech Startup, and the days are getting pretty long - this involves waking up at 9am and working from 10am to 6pm.  While I get that this isn't a super long day when compared to other careers, with my condition and the mental strain the work requires I am finding myself crashing at around 3pm each day.  Is it a bad idea to double up on my 20mg SR Ritalin, and take the second one at 3pm? In theory that would take me through to 10pm which would allow me to get a good amount of work in. Perhaps with a break from work for a good hour at around 1 or 2 pm? I aim to be asleep at 1am, but normally nod off at about 2am - 3am.  I've taken twice in a day several times and noticed no negative side effects, however I don't want to start doing it regularly if there are some really bad potential problems that I've overlooked.  Cheers!
