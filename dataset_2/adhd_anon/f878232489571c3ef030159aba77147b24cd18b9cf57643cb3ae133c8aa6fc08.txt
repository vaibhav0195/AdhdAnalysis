f878232489571c3ef030159aba77147b24cd18b9cf57643cb3ae133c8aa6fc08;;;Career issues;;;   So I work for a package delivery company and I recently got offered a chance to be a driver (well I applied a while ago but they just now got openings for drivers). This would make me a lot of money so I jumped on the offer. Usually the procedure is that you go to the driver class and if you pass, they move you to a part time or full time position based on need. Apparently, they changed the way they find candidates. This time me and the other applicants were given a page with driver safety stuff on it and told to study it and be able to recite certain parts verbatim. If we couldn't pass a test on it by Friday (of last week), we couldn't even take the course.          I didn't study.           I've never been able to even review material unless I have actually been taught it either through a discussion, an in-depth lecture with notes (possibly my least favorite way but it helps), or even a video. I ended up telling my supervisor that I didn't study so taking the test would have yielded little to nothing. I'll post more info on what exactly I said in a comment, but the important thing is that I didn't mention having ADHD. I know I most likely should have, but I hate the idea of using it as an excuse. Also, I believe that if they have to make concessions for me, they would have to do the same for the other employees and I don't know exactly how to feel about that. I am fairly sure I have totally missed my chance and it's killing me.          Today, when asked about the driver test, I found myself frequently having to tell people that I have ADHD. I'm afraid now of appearing to be a weak person who only seeks an excuse.          My issues now are:      * Was not mentioning my ADHD a major mistake?  * Why did I avoid telling my supervisor this and then just spread the info at the slightest prompting?    * Was this an example of the company being unfair or me looking for reasons to not study? Was I just feeling lazy or entitled? Am I using my ADHD as a crutch?    * How can I live with this when I can't even study one page of information (half of which I knew from my current position)?         tl;dr: Had to study small amount of info for test to further career. Didn't. Offered no information to supervisor regarding ADHD, but told everyone else.
