774bacd1f0a05c8aeef78b9a6e015c19038a6163261bf3f275f2e296173a23fa;;;I'll be interviewing for a new position at my current office and could use some advice;;;I’ve been with this office for 2.5 years, and have struggled with undiagnosed ADHD during that time. As a result, I have had numerous written warnings and bad reviews regarding my attention to detail/work product/performance/etc. I hit bottom a month ago and made my psych appointment, I was diagnosed with ADHD and I’m now on Wellbutrin and Concerta and doing much better.   My problem, however, is that the people on the interview panel have known me for so long and they know of the problems I’ve had while I’ve been working here. I didn’t advertise my ADHD diagnosis, so for all they know I’ve just been a lazy, distractible, untrustworthy employee.   It’s still a struggle at times, but I’ve definitely been doing better since I’ve been medicated. How do I explain to the panel that I’m now worthy of this new job? I don’t really feel comfortable telling them “oh, well that was before I was medicated” in response to any questions about my past performance, but I also don’t really have any other reason as to why I’m all of a sudden a better worker.   If anyone has done this before, I’d love some advice.   Thanks!   **TL;DR**  Been a shit employee due to undiagnosed ADHD, now medicated and better, how do I explain why I deserve a new job to an interview panel of people who know me as a shit employee?
