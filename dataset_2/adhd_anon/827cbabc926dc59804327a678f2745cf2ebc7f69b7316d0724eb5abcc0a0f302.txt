I have a prior diagnosis of ADHD-PI, but have let it sit on a back burner after drugs weren't terrifically effective and I dealt with my bipolar 2. Now my mood has been stable for several months and my brain still isn't cooperating with reality, so I'd like to revisit ADHD and try to get it treated.  Though my therapist was supportive of getting me treatment, she gave me flat out incorrect information:** "the good news is that ADHD gets better as you get older."** Nothing I've read indicates that it gets better. The physical hyperactivity might decline, but the inattentiveness and impulsivity remain.   My psych nurse was a harder sell. He attributes any inattentiveness / flakiness I have to depression, even though I tell him flat out tell him I've lost interest in about 50 different activities throughout my life regardless of mood. I mean, if it was just depression, I'd think I'd go back to the same things when I get better. I don't. I move onto something else. Then I quit, sometimes co-occurring with a depressive episode, sometimes not, never to return to again. So while I'm trying to convince him that the ADHD is responsible for my lack of motivation to pursue consistent activities, he responds with the gem. **"ADHD does not affect motivation."**   He has reluctantly put me on Strattera, but I feel like I'm going to be fighting with him about whether I have ADHD; and if he doesn't think ADHD effects motivation, I don't really see how he is competent to judge whether the drug is working.  So question for raddit: have you dealt with incompetent providers before? how have you dealt with it? are the open to educating themselves? if you can browbeat them into medical treatment, do they do an ok job of prescribing, titrating and monitoring?   **TLDR:** My providers have plain wrong information about ADHD. What to do?

The first time I got a coach; my psychiatrist wasn't on board with a diagnosis, so I received no medication. It was a wasted effort. The second time, I received treatment briefly, but two medication trials didn't make a significant impact in my life, so I stopped taking them and didn't visit the issue for about a year.  Until about two weeks ago when diagnosing and treating ADHD became the single most important thing in my life. Today I've spent hours on this reddit commenting on ADHD and reading materials on it. I'm perserverating on it -- the same way I'd perserverate on playing guitar, clarinet, jiujitsu, videogames, carpentry, clarinet, etc.   I'm seeing a psych nurse next week. But I'm concerned, in this moment of lucidity, that the next treatment will be ineffective in the short term and that I will lose interest in treating my ADHD as I've lost interest in every project I've ever undertaken. My career is already over -- I'm on disability -- and that was my biggest motivation throughout my life for treatment (which was mostly spent missing the diagnosis of bipolar ii).   tldr; does ADHD make itself more difficult to treat because you lose interest in it?
