Sometimes I feel like I will never find love despite that I am not looking for a relationship right now. I am falling behind in terms of schoolwork so I am working hard to catch up. I spend most of my time alone so I can count the number of friends I have on one hand.  I suck at small talk. It's not like I am rude but I think because of my past experiences, I've been conditioned to be oversensitive and sometimes distrustful of people.  Sometimes I feel like I will never find love. I have never dated before and I know nothing about the dating game.
