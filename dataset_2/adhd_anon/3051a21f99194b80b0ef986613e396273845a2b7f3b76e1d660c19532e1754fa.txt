Will stimulants help or just make my anxiety worse?;;;I have a documented history of cannabis abuse and have been clean for 3 months. I would self medicate my anxiety with marijuana. Now I have been using clonazapam and have been off of of weed.   I have been formally tested and undergone CBT and been diagnosed with ADHD-inattentive and Generalized Anxiety Disorder.   My question to you folks is how your pDoc went about treating both conditions.   Were you able to be prescribed both clonazapam and a stimulant? What were your doctors main concerns? Did stimulants make your anxiety better or worse?
