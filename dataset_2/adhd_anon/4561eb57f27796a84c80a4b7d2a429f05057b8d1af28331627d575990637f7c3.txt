Looking back at my life, I feel like I was much more on the PH side of things as a kid, with very little PI symptoms. Now as I've gotten older, my PH has almost all but faded away (except for fidgeting and talking excessively *^(although this is only when I'm drunk)*) and my PI symptoms seem to be getting worse. My short term memory is almost non-existent, my sense of time is horrible and everyday is an active battle to stay focused on the things I need to get done. Now I don't think I need my dosage increased, because I just had it bumped up back in January.  Is this a common thing as people with ADHD get older? I know PH usually starts to fade off as people get past puberty, but does PI get worse as the brain ages? If so, does doing mental exercises help to slow down the process?
