cd5e124f31a0a7ec296bed4f4705fa490f7b1bd4edf06ac578866a663d2c41f2;;;My mom has ADHD and didn't tell me;;;I'm pretty pissed right now. I've dealt with depression and anxiety my whole life. I'm 20 now, started therapy and meds last year. Things have gotten really bad lately, and I had a hunch that what im going through is not just depression. I was diagnosed with (high score) ADHD.   So I told my mom. We haven't been on great terms lately, but I had to tell her this. She told me she has it too and was on Ritalin all throughout school. We tell each other everything, and she didn't mention this!   I had to try so hard in high school and college just to get by. I have ruined so many relationships. I feel like she set me up for failure for not getting me help sooner.  I am so relieved that I know now though! I don't have to feel so useless and dumb.
