No matter how much water I drink i still have cotton mouth and i dry heave cough occassionally.. These symptoms go stat until I fall asleep and wake up.. Which is usually 12 hours later.. I usually lose 1-3 pounds when I'm on it... I was wondering does anyone else feel this way as well and what remedies have you used? I try my hardest to force myself to eat but it's just too dry...
