0d8282d3c1811509bf4a92727f0edd98d0f8d413b9cfa3fe947f1865c0c7f890;;;My usual mornings... Can you relate?;;;It sucks how much harder it is to do things than other people. This morning, I wanted to make coffee so I got the coffee container out of the freezer and did the usual making-coffee stuff like people do. But then I couldn't find where I set the lid that goes back on the coffee jar. I searched the kitchen. Knowing me and where I might have set it, I looked through the dirty dishes on the counter and I looked in the food cabinets. I found it on top of my fresh vegetable pile in the corner of the counter.  By that time though, I was already making my breakfast (of course, I had thought about making coffee so stopped making breakfast to go do that). But I couldn't remember where I set my plate with my  half-made up breakfast sandwich. Found it on another flat surface in the kitchen.   And then I wanted to have my phone so I could look at my messages while I eat and couldn't remember where I set it before I started making the coffee.  This is every day for me. It's like I'm just floating about life and then every once in awhile I stop to think about where I was floating a couple seconds ago because I hadn't been thinking while I was floating.   I always thought this was just part of my personality but now I know it's a symptom of my ADHD. I don't know life to be a different way. This is how I've always been. It blows my mind that there are other people out there who don't have to try so hard to just get up, make coffee and have breakfast. While we ADHDers have already run a mental marathon before noon.  Honestly? You know what I'm doing now? I thought about ADHD Reddit right after this realization this morning. And now, I'm here at my laptop with half my breakfast still uneaten on the plate in my lap.
