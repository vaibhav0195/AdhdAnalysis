With the concerta I can actually focus on task IF I actually can get started with them. I have used some techniques to help me but they never last longer than 3-4 days before I stop using them (huzzah for no foresight.) but even when I am using the techniques I still find it hard to actually get started on homework and projects. (Although I find it easy to do tasks that have been issued to me one at a time or on a written list.) I guess what i am really asking is how do I stick to the techniques so I can actually do the work that I am required to be a self starter on.   TL;DR   * Use techniques for a short time , doesn't help me.  * can focus but not a self-starter.  * hurting academic performance/potential   Edit:formatting
