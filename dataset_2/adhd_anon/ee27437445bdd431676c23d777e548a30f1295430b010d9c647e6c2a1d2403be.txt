Once upon a time, the US had a very serious, well funded, and comprehensive mental health program. We [start with deinstitutionalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinstitutionalisation), circa 1955. As a whole, this was a good thing. It's one thing to say that the mentally ill need help. It's another to treat a wide range of mental difficulties as dehumanizing conditions that deserve lifelong imprisonment in a mental hospital. It wasn't perfect, though. Towards the end of the deinstitutionalization movement, we get [the Community Mental Health Act of 1963](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Mental_Health_Act). This marks the start of what you'd recognize as the modern US mental health policy. State hospitals for mental health will still exist, but unless sufferers pose an imminent threat to themselves or others, there's no state-funded care. State-funded care comes with state-funded compulsion. Basically, unless the police will dump your ass in a psych ward, you need to handle your own care. If you're interested in what that looked like on a personal level, the New York Times put out [an interesting, if long, article](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402E0DE1138F937A15755C0A9649D8B63) on it. In theory, the CMHA was supposed to provide funding for private care, but [that didn't quite pan out](http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/50-years-later-kennedyrsquos-vision-for-mental-health-not-realized/). Not enough money. Not enough community support. Perverse incentives to put people where they don't belong. So then, what happens? They go where all American societal problems go when we stop caring: [prison](http://www.tacreports.org/storage/documents/treatment-behind-bars/treatment-behind-bars-abridged.pdf). If you're a drug addict, you don't go to a hospital (unless you're rich enough for multiple trips to fairly low-success rehab clinics), you go to prison for possession. If you're schizophrenic and can't afford or start refusing your meds, you're on your own until you have an incident and stab Morgan Freeman's goddaughter. Then you go to prison. Increasingly, if you're just unbalanced enough that it's hard to keep a job, you go to prison for sleeping in public or panhandling. What's left isn't a failing system. The system is gone. The state's only involvement in mental health is via police. Suicidal? Handcuffed and shipped off to a psych ward. Knife in hand and ready to go off? Psych ward or prison, pretty much at random. Can't function like everyone else? Prison. Where's the actual treatment in all of this? It *does* exist, but only if you have money. The people who need help are less likely than the population at large to have money, so there's lots of treatment for things like high functioning depressives and kids with ADHD and not so much for the people who need it more. It's not a public health policy anymore.  So, the mental health system stuff is rather obvious, but what I wanted to point out is his last statement.  &gt;so there's lots of treatment for things like high functioning depressives and kids with ADHD and not so much for the people who need it more.  Now, before you start demanding this guy be burned on the stake, let me explain how his innocent here.  You see, this is how the average american views depression and ADHD, they view it as non-problems and something you can just work off. For most of us, this is not the case. But why does he believe this?  Well, its simple. He doesn't know any better. No one ever told him how ADHD and Depression can be just as debilitating as something like schizophrenia. Hell, if anything, american media portrays both conditions as a joke the vast majority of the time. This is the main problem. Change will never happen if the general public remains ignorant of the reality's of these conditions.  So, whats your opinion on this? How could we change this with-in the foresee-able future?
