I was diagnosed with ADD as a child, but ADD doesn't cover all of the mental issues I have.   Now, I take one 10mg instant release addy a day, since last year, as a senior in high school today. It used to be on weekdays only, I'd use the weekend as a short break from its heavy effects on me. I used to deal with the teeth clenching the robot feeling etc. etc. etc. side effects. Now I'm left with the cold hot sweats in the middle of the night and I'm balanced out on it, and now I pretty much need it to function. I spend all of my time on school at the sacrifice of it, and I'm starting to realize this wasn't worth it, it wasn't worth the graduation of high school to erode and decay my mind. I'm not on it today for the first time in a long time. I'm afraid to get off of it, because then I won't seem normal to everyone else. That, and the last time I was off of it for three days, I had scary thoughts........ok....I don't feel like writing anymore.
