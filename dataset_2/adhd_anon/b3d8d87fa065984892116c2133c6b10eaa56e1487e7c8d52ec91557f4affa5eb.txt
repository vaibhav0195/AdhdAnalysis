Really need to pull this off Any ideas to help?;;;So I have ADHD and I am currently writing my Final Course Assessment for a University class. I have already done quite well (Credit and Distinction) but need to come through in the clutch. 5100 words. I am on concerta but can find myself procrastinating or getting distracted. Any ideas to help me nail this?  ***EDIT: Still going strong! Found myself procrastinating a little, but I am still on track. It's good to have you guys around! I'll keep you updated. EDIT 2 Just found out that the work I had been doing was not actually what was required. A bit of a downer, but I am going to use what I have written in what I actually need to write. EDIT 3 managed to get quite a bit done last night. As suggested, I made sure that i got sleep. Full 6 hours. Feel refreshed***
