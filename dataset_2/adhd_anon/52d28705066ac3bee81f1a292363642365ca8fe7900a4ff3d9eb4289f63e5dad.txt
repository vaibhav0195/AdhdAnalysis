An anecdote.;;;Well, my partner and I have had suspicions about me for a while now, and today I finally had an evaluation with a psychiatrist, who has confirmed that I have ~~ADD. *(Yes, officially it's specifically 'ADD', as opposed to 'ADHD'. I assume that's still welcome here...)*~~ edit: I get it now. "Non-Hyperactive ADHD", I guess is the right way to phrase this?  All at once, my life seemed to click neatly into a repeating pattern of cycles. School reports with "has potential, but..." written all over them. Warnings. Missed deadlines. Distractedness and disorganisation. Getting behind with tasks, and that then bringing in anxiety and a sense of failure. It was both elating and completely horrifying. I genuinely don't really understand how this wasn't caught two whole decades ago.   When we finished our session, he wrote me a prescription, and we had a quick discussion about how it's a restricted substance, very important that I look after the script and, once I have them, the pills.   So... I headed to the chemist to fill the script, as you do, right? On the way, there was a store selling novelty cupcakes. **Ooh, shiny**.   Next thing you know I'm walking away from the shops carrying a box of cupcakes, and I've completely forgotten about going to the drugstore.   And all I could do was sigh, laugh out loud, and mutter to myself *"well... after today, at least now I know why I just did that".*    **TL;DR: Prescribed medication to help with ADD. Distracted by shiny things on way to drugstore. Forgot to pick up medication.**   Edit 2: [the shiny cupcakes](http://s3.amazonaws.com/foodspotting-ec2/reviews/3142335/thumb_600.jpg)
