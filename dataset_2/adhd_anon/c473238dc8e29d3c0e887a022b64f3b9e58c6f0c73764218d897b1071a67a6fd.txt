Share your experiences..;;;Since I have insurance now, I will be visiting a doctor or going strait to a psyciatrist to explain that I may have ADHD after researching about symptoms and comparing to my own experiences.  How will they diagnose me? Questions? Physical tests?  Will it take more than one visit? If so, how many?  I have read many other posts where people go to get diagnosed for ADHD and leave with a diagnosis for depression, or other conditions. How often does this happen? Did it happen to you?  If you're comfortable sharing, what was your experience with becoming diagnosed?  Thanks..
