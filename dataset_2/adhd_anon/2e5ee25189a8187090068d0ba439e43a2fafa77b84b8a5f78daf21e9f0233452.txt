Just diagnosed in Nov.2014 upped to 40mg Vyvanse  Disappointed,was hoping to focus,quiet my mind. All I'm feeling is severe neck,shoulder and upper back pain. But after reading blogs I think it's cause by dehydration which affects the spine! I know my thirst has doubled but I've been drinking more tea, which is a diuretic amongst  my 3 cups of coffee in the morning! Seems like this pain is not a side effect  But as I can see I'm not the only one! Hope water is one of my answers or one of yours. So why isn't this pill helping me focus?  So very disappointed. Anyone one else have this problem?
