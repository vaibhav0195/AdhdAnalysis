Advice? ;;;A couple of months ago I began seeing a clinical psychologist about some issues I was having with anxiety. Several sessions later he tells me that he sees a pattern emerging in my stories about issues I struggle with and about my life in general. This pattern, he says, is ADD. He also thinks that it's likely that it went undiagnosed for this long (I'm 28) because I don't have much of the hyperactivity component. I'm in my last year of college and my therapist thinks that going on some medication for ADD might help me keep up with my difficult school / work schedule.   So a few weeks ago my therapist referred me to a psychiatrist to talk about meds since he can't prescribe them himself. The psychiatrist feels my blood pressure is too high to prescribe stimulant meds. He tried Tenex, which is supposed to lower blood pressure as well as treat ADD, but I had really awful side effects from it and stopped taking it after a few days.  I'm just wondering if anyone has any suggestions to do with ADD and high blood pressure. I'm trying to diet and lose weight to see if that helps, but that approach is going to take a lot of time. I'm trying to decide if I should go to my GP and see if he has some suggestion on how to deal with both the ADD and high BP, but I'm at a loss. It seems like no matter what I do I won't be able to get help for the ADD when I need it most.   TL;DR - Psychiatrist won't prescribe Ritalin due to high blood pressure. Advice?
