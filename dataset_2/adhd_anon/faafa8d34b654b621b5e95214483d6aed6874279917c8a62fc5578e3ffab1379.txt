Now that I have my diagnosis I'm trying to understand myself better and improve my coping strategies.  So I was just wondering if anyone else ever deliberately triggers a state of 'hyperfocus' (that might not be the right word), or if you find that being out of breath makes your brain work faster. I work in retail and when I have to put a lot of stock out in a short amount of time, I have this thing I do where I start moving really fast and deliberately making my breathing short and quick. I go kind of light-headed but I guess the lack of oxygen triggers an adrenaline boost or something and I can work very very quickly with hyperfocus. I get even more clumsy but it doesn't slow me down somehow and nothing distracts me. I can work like three times as fast when I deliberately put myself in this state but I don't do it all the time because it's tiring and probably no good for me, I save it for emergencies. Similarly, when I'm at home and I'm trying to think about something complicated, I'll jump up and down or run up and down the hallway, and somehow being out of breath makes me think faster.   So does anyone else find being out of breath helps them think faster, and do you ever do this on purpose?
