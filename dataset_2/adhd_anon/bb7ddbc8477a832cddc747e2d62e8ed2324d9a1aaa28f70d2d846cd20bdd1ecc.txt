What is weird is that the drug has very little to no effect on me recently, even after 3+ hours I feel nothing. Yet, If I take a 10mg Ritalin IR I feel some effects within an hour that last about 2 hrs. Without any benefits I do still get the Concerta crash and feel very drowsy and zombie like after about 8 hrs of taking the drug. Honestly, if it wasn't for the crash I would be convinced I received placebos. I used to take adderall and it seems that a significantly lower dose (20mg XR) lasted a good portion of the day and had little to no crash. Has anyone else experienced minimal effectiveness of this drug?
