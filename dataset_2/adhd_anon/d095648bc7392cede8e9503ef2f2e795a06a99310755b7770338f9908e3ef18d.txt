If i take it straight for about 2 weeks there comes a point where it feels like it's not working as well and then comes the sore body/joints/bones. The feeling is like when you have a really bad flu and you just feel like you got hit by a semi truck. Has anyone experienced similar side effects and is there anything I can do? I'm scared to proceed with it for a prolonged amount of time.  I've already spoke with my doctor about it but she says to keep trying it and if it persists than she will put me on adderall.
