I have been taking Adderall XR for some time now and I feel like it would be helping out a lot if I didn't have so much stress and anxiety flowing through my mind daily. The Adderall makes the anxiety a bit worse but I feel like it's the only way I can accomplish assignments at a somewhat normal to slower than average pace. I have heard that there are alternatives to Adderall that may work better with my system but I don't want to give up the little focus I am gaining from my current script.   My main question comes down to this:  * Do you guys have any suggestions or have been through a similar situation where switching meds made a world of difference?   I am looking for any advice really. I just feel like my symptoms are not as serious as some suffer from, so I am hesitant to change what I have going now.
