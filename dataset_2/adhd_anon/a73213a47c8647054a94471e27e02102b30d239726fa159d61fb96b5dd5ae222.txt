a73213a47c8647054a94471e27e02102b30d239726fa159d61fb96b5dd5ae222;;;My first week on methylphenidate;;;I was diagnosed with ADHD-PI about a week ago and immediately got a treatment plan for methylphenidate. I started with a dosage of 5mg time-release methylphenidate (Medikinet Adult) twice a day and am now up to 10mg twice a day. My treatment plan will have me up to 20mg twice a day starting in about 10 days.   On 5mg I noticed almost nothing, but the doc already warned me about that. The only thing I did notice was that my threshold to start doing stuff was ever so slightly lowered. Not sure if that was a placebo effect though.   Then on 10mg the side effects started showing. On the med, I feel foggy, tired, often times nervous/restless, I sweat more and I get more headaches. To be fair, I often have these issues without the meds, but now they are slightly more pronounced and more frequent. Also after 4 days on 10mg, my appetite is definitely reduced and it feels like I have a knot in my stomach. I haven't noticed any improvement on concentration, motivation or mood.   With all that being said, I'm supposed to give some feedback to the doc on how the meds as soon as I'm done with the dosage plan. I'll probably just stick it out and then talk to the doc about my experience. However, I'm wondering if this is any indication that MPH is not working for me? How likely is it that these side effects disappear and the actual positive effects start taking over at higher doses? Or is it more likely that the side effects get worse even if there might be positive effects as well?   TL;DR: Only side effects so far on methylphenidate. Is it likely that mph doesn't work for me or can the situation turn around with a higher dose?
