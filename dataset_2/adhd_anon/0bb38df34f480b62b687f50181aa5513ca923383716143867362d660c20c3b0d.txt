0bb38df34f480b62b687f50181aa5513ca923383716143867362d660c20c3b0d;;;Currently looking for a new doctor, but I'm concerned about my side effects in the mean time.;;;I've been diagnosed and have been on Concerta before but it didn't help - felt tired and it didn't have any affect on me.  Currently on adderall - 20mg, instant release (i think)  first day was great, i'm now on the third day and i'm feeling weird.  my skin feels tingly and i have goosebumps a lot, i feel like i have too much energy in my chest and i need to scream or something.  i've been feeling absolutely exhausted by 2-3pm too.  right now my arms feel really weird and i'm kinda dizzy  is this kind of just something that'll go away once i get used to the medication?  i took the ACTs and it helped a lot, but just being at home it feels like too much and i don't know what to do.  my doctor that prescribed it is my primary care so i'm looking for an actual psychiatrist, but there's long wait lists.  tl;dr feeling weird on adderall and i'm not sure what to do about it
