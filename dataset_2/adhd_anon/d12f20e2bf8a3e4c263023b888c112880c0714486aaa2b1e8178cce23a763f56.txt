What usually happens is that they work wonderfully for the first week and then turn me into a lethargic, depressed, and emotionless wreck afterwards. They generally makes everything worse including my ADHD symptoms.  I really want help dealing with it because at this point I feel utterly hopeless with life. I've gotten to the point where I no longer peruse goals because I know I'll never achieve them.
