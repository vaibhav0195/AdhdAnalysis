I have had debilitating ADHD, and its been ruining my success since I can remember. I have never passed a class until this year and have a long history of getting in fights and saying things i shouldn't. I'm currently seeing a therapist and I'm going to be put on meds in feb. I'm working towards my diploma right now and really have to focus and work or I'll be kicked from the program I'm in. My problem is the only time I get work done is when I buy meds from various sources, which is expensive and dangerous. I NEED a solution for the short term, got any?
