47e27701e501ac2df1189c392b0ff891c76b8156ad984c16eefbe61985b30f49;;;Should I get another doctor opinion? And what are the other options for ADD other than vyvanse?;;;First of all, I was diagnosed with ADD few weeks ago when I was doing the usual physical exam with blood tests. I told the doctor about my symptoms and he kept asking me different questions until he told me at the end that I had ADD and prescribed a 40mg vyvanse.  I wasn't sure about, so I took few days looking for ADD through internet and checking the symptoms again. Then I started taking my pills. It makes me awake for more than 30hours and I have sharp fully functioned brain at the time I am taking it.   My concern here that the pills might affect me in the long run and I am looking for alternative options other than those pills. Also should I ask another professional doctor? What doctor should I go to ?   Thanks
