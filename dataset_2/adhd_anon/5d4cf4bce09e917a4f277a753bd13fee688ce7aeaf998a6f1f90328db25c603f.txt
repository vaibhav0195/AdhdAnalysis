5d4cf4bce09e917a4f277a753bd13fee688ce7aeaf998a6f1f90328db25c603f;;;Dealing with obsessiveness;;;I am experiencing extreme obsessiveness over something that is truly stupid......a phone. I don't wanna start an android apple war but i am wanting to switch devices. For a long time I have battled back and forth on which device to own and have even switched back and forth. My wife is dead set against me switching and at this point in time I truly feel it is just a magic carpet I am chasing. It isn't what I truly want but is what I need for my fix. Any suggestions on how to deal with it?
