9423a32fc593cd4c15d4134744bdbf0e80ddd1d2824a99546d92a18ee8433b0a;;;University refused to diagnose me due to implied campus drug problem.;;;I had a phone appointment with my university's health center and it was very bizarre.    A woman asked me "so tell me why you called" and I said "well I think I might have ADD or ADHD, but I'm not sure because I don't know what is and isn't normal behavior."  She said "we can offer study skills coaching but we don't do diagnostics or prescriptions with that sort of thing."  I said "why, because of kids showing fake symptoms?"  She said 'yeah they sell their medications and that sort of thing.'   I'm at a top 100 secular American college.  This is so weird.  I'm really scared because I think I'm gonna flunk out of college if I don't get this fixed.  Already looking at community colleges back home.    When you go to a diagnostic session, are they supposed to ask YOU questions?  Or is it a "present your case" thing?  Should I prep?    I don't know what to do..  It's not like a physical thing where you go "my arm hurts."  I've never done a mental health type thing before :(
