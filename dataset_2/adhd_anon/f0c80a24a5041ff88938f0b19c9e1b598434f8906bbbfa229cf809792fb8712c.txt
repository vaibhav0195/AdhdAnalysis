(x-post from /r/narcolepsy);;;For the past several years (I'm in high school) I've always had trouble staying awake during my school days and even at home some times. To me, I was normal, because I know everyone falls asleep at school. But the thing is I recently experienced sleep paralysis for the first time, and this lead me to look at Narcolepsy as a possibility. Does Narcolepsy ever group with AD/HD? I was diagnosed with depression but that diagnosis was, to me, incorrect and it now looks like AD/HD to me, but as I stated above, the symptoms for Narcolepsy have made themselves clear and I'm just not really sure what to think. If it matters my AD/HD (if that's really it) symptoms have had to do with inattention, inability to focus on a topic which leads me to trouble grasping concepts and therefore academic failure, and the inability to be still or be inactive to some extent. All of this, coupled with my falling asleep at inappropriate times, have just made my grades, and mood, drop. Please help, reddit. What are your thoughts?
