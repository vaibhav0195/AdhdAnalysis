I've got severe attention problems that look more like the result of a head injury than merely ADD. I'm also diagnosed OCD. I'm 26 credit hours away from a psych degree. School has been getting more and more horrific. I'm reasonably intelligent, but my study/student skills are severely underdeveloped. My effort is extraordinary. My return is average, until this past semester when I failed 2 of my 3 classes. If I am not eating or working out, I'm studying. I just can't seem to figure out how I should be spending my time while doing so.   **Basically, I need to learn how to be a studentâ€”how to organize assignments, break down projects into smaller tasks, and how to pull the right information out of reading materials and lectures.** It's like I'm at work, but my boss isn't. So I'm ready to work, I just have no idea what I should do, and I wing it. kind of aimlessly meandering my way through assignments, taking far more time to do them than I ought to. I fucking such at being a student. I'm actually taking this semester off because I've had enough. I love to learn and I want so badly to be able to focus sufficiently. School doesn't have to be a painful, horrible experience. I am convinced that if I can learn how to learn, that I would love school. Does anyone have any suggestions or recommendations for how to achieve this end? I need to learn how to learn.  TLDR: I've gone as far in college as I can go w/o help. I need to learn how to learn. Any suggetions?
