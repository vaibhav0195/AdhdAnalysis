Just spent the last 15 minutes feeling like absolute shit.;;;Went on to Reddit and started reading this thread "[Why do so many run with the assumption that increased ADHD diagnoses in children must be a bad thing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/psychology/comments/10nt4b/why_do_so_many_run_with_the_assumption_that/)," and I figured the thing has fifty something upvotes so it's doing pretty good for /ADHD, and certainly worth scanning through.  Reading the comments and I am absolutely awestruck at the amount of misinformation being spewed out.  ***Comment - My thoughts***  ADHD epidemic - According to Barkley, no evidence of such.  ADHD drugs addicting - Not when prescribed properly.  Someone said people with ADHD seek out extra drama for extra stimulation. Im a therapist and think that's absolute crap. - I don't know, but I thought this was true.  ADHD testing is bullshit.  I purposely forgot things on the test and when I was supposed to hit the spacebar when I saw an X on the screen, I just mashed the spacebar because I thought it was funny.  My results said I had severe ADHD but in reality it's only minor. - Well this form of testing is by no means the best indicator of ADHD, but no shit, any test that you purposely fuck with will give fucked results.    Basically all this random bullshit being said and I thought to myself, what the hell happened to /ADHD?  Since when have these people become so ill-informed and believe in so many myths?  I felt like the only person on earth for a minute that had seen *any* of Barkely's videos.  THEN, I realized I was in /psychology and a flood of relief came over me.  Such a relief.  //End Rant   **TLDR; Everyone in comments was a moron and knew none of the facts about ADHD.  I thought this subreddit had gone to shit.  Then I realized I was in /r/psychology and felt a ton better.**   Carry on being awesome /ADHD! Cheers!

Because we're not all jumpy and hyperactive, I get that it's harder for us to notice changes in our own attention spans and what not, but specifically, what are some ways that you all can tell your meds are working?  I guess I'm looking for some quantitative ways of measuring, if there are any.  (I feel extremely uncomfortable asking friends blatantly if I have been acting differently lately.  I don't wanna freak them out.)  My doc has been pretty flexible and has given me the go ahead to try 10mg capsules, up to 6 in one day, but only after trying each level for around 4 days to see how I react (ie 1 capsule for a few days, 2 capsules for the next few days, 3... etc until the side effects are too much)  Also, what's the crash like?  The same as those with hyperactivity, or is it more subtle?  Here's where I'm at so far:  * 10 mg/day did nothing.  * 20 mg/day a bit more focused.  Still distractible though. (This may be the dose I end up with.)  * 30 mg/day Head feels a little heavy/thick/(but not foggy), into the afternoon a headache comes on.  Slightly tight chest.  I've been drinking a lot of water to compensate for the meds, and the headaches may just be from tapering off caffeine too quickly.  **TLDR: Basically, how did you find the right dose for you?  When was it too much, and when were your meds not working enough and how could you tell?  For innatentives in general, what medication works best?  Thanks!**  (I searched a few times but didn't quite find what I was looking for.  If anyone just wants to pass along some links, that would also be totally fine by me.)
