My fingers were disgusting to look at, as I would chew them so short that they would bleed. Throughout my life, I've tried countless times to stop biting them &amp; never had success. Even when I would get acrylics put on, I'd nibble at those.  Anyway, I was diagnosed over the summer &amp; after being put on on Concerta (on Ritalin LA, now), I stopped without trying. I think I was about 3 weeks into my medication when I looked at my fingers &amp; noticed that I hadn't been chewing my nails. The fact that I quit a 28 or 29 year habit (I'm 31) without even trying blows my mind. I mentioned this to my doctor &amp; he said that he had never had a patient mention this; just the opposite. Has anyone else experienced this?
