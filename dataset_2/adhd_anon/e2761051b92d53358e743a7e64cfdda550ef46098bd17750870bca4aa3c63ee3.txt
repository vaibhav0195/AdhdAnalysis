Thank you /r/adhd, you guys have made all the difference, thank you.;;;Starting from over one month ago, I found out about adhd, learned about the symptoms, everything clicked, my childhood makes sense, my present, and my future all make sense.  With the realization that I have adhd, I told my parents. This is a road that i was met with doubt, and anger from my dad. He claimed that i am simply lazy, and need to try harder than to find something to blame for my performance. This soon turned into my dad in denial, and started to say just deal with it, and ranted about medications for a while. He took no effort in helping me find a psychiatrist to evaluate, he instead found reasons to blame me for the adhd symptoms, and that i took no intiative in order to "fix" the adhd.  This is where the subreddit helps the most, having no other outlet or intake of information, i found first hand information and knowledge about the adhd ,and its treatment options. Without /r/adhd I don't think I would be where I am right now.  Anyways, with continued posts, comments and browsing i was able to keep trying to find a way to get diagnosed with my parents approval.   I called so many places, so many resource desks and various psychiatrists, they were either full or cannot take me because i have no insurance, so after about 30 calls i was finally able to find a doctor who would take me in.   After 1 week of making the appointment, I went in, talked to the doctor about my symptoms, dangers, behavior, and school performance. Despite me being very anxious i have to say it went very well and I was on my way with a concerta 18mg prescription in about 45 minutes.   Thank you so much, reddit for helping me through this process!   (for those who are wondering i deleted my other ADHD_Confucious account and made this one)
