A lot of my friends don't fully understand ADHD and so I've decided to join this community for support, and to support others one day. I'm pretty woozy from the temazepam I took for my anxiety so let's see how this goes.. (not sure how they correlate, sorry). If no one completely reads this, I understand because I understand your condition. I wouldn't read this if I were you, either.      I recently found this sub through a friend of mine who suffers from ADHD as well. My entire life (I'm 24 this April) my mother has 'joked' how I have ADHD, but I was never given treatment for this. I have so many stories when I was a child of how my ADHD affected my life then, but both my parents strongly believe that medication is not the answer. Growing up, I [would like to think that I] was a good student, although it took a lot of energy for my parents to make me do my homework. I scored top or second in my class from K-6, then the distractions of puberty began. I went from an all honors student to an average student, and then I barely graduated high school. I always blamed my failure on me being rebellious, but I've begun to realize that I don't think that was the case at all. I've realized that I am very forgetful, have selective memory, and my attention span equals that of a goldfish. I would constantly forget about assignments that are due, and it is STILL very difficult for me to focus on school. I'm still in school because I couldn't make the assignment deadlines and I even forgot the dates for a couple finals for my classes (it's really discouraging to see my peers graduate on time and work elaborate jobs that they found through networking, which is also really difficult for me to do).       This 'joke' that my mom made of ADHD was always in the back of my mind, but I never realized that it was real until (I feel like I'm going to get a lot of hate for him) I tried adderall for the first time. I have many friends who use adderall as a recreational drug as well as to study (I am aware that this is completely unacceptable). I was always apprehensive about trying it because of the 'morals' that my parents instilled in my brain growing up--mind over matter. Sorry if this sounds like an excuse, but I went through a really bad break up last year and I decided to try it. I got the complete opposite effect of my friend, and she said that the possibility of ADHD is extremely possible. I was extremely focused, I didn't bite my fingers like I normally do (dermatophagia), I wasn't on my phone at ALL (I'm ALWAYS playing games on my phone: Candy Crush, Mujo, 2048, Threes, etc.. In case anyone is wondering), I wasn't interrupting anyone talking to me or their conversation to word vomit what was on my mind, and I felt some strange form of compassion towards the close people in my life.       My current boyfriend, upon hearing this story, completely agreed with her, and told me to meet one of his best friends who has ADHD. After a series of long talks with said friend, we came to the conclusion that I pretty much have ADHD. I started to see a psychiatrist this past December, but because of my anxiety issues (another long story..) she advised that we get past the anxiety first before testing for ADHD. She does agree that I probably do have ADHD, as does my physician (I don't know why this is relevant), but I probably won't be able to get the official diagnosis until April or May. My anxiety isn't too bad (I'm on Zoloft 50mg, for you curious people) and my psychiatrist said I should be off of it in a couple months.       I want at least one parent to be supportive of my condition, so I told my mom last night that I had ADHD. It went like this:    *Me: Mom, I think I really have ADHD.    *Mom: I know!    *Me: Why didn't I get medicated for it?    *Mom: You don't need medicine, it will only mess you up more.    *Me: But there's science behind all the medicine.    *Mom: If you keep putting things into your body then you're going to get really messed up later. You just need to learn to control yourself and you really need to work on time management.    *Me: Okay...   So I guess that won't work.         A few symptoms I believe is correlated with ADHD (PLEASE correct me if I'm wrong) are:    * I can't be in a department store, Walmart, Target, etc., for too long. The lights are always so bright and the items lined up against the wall are so visually stimulating that it gets me light-headed.    * I can't focus on people when they talk to me, I have to be fidgeting on my phone, or playing with my Rubik's cube, or staring at something off in the distance.    * I drive with the window visor down even if the sun isn't in my face, because the entire windshield is too overwhelming for me to look through.    * My priorities are all out of whack, even know I know what the should be.    * It takes me forever to get started on a project/assignment because I'm constantly distracted by EVERYTHING--clouds, bugs, the floor, a crack on the table, peoples' voices, etc.    * If there are too many people talking around me, I can't listen to anything the person I'm conversing with is saying to me.   Those are just to name a few, and because I haven't been officially diagnosed yet, I could be completely wrong.      I don't blame my parents for not putting me on medication sooner. I can understand where the're coming from, and growing up they have always tried their best to help me succeed. But obviously I'm keeping this a secret from my parents. I'm so glad I found out about this sub. I thought I was alone this entire time, but it is very comforting to know that I'm not. Thank you all in this sub.      I apologize again for the poorly written post. My mind tends to jump around a lot... haha.       I'll keep everyone updated on my... Progression? Is that the right word?       Thank you everyone in advance who actually took the time to read this lengthy-ass post.         TL;DR a long ass post about my journey to my ADHD discovery.    edit: edited to reformat, but I think I failed... Sorry everyone again :(
