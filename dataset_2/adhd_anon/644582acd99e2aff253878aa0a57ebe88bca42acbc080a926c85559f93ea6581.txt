To say it's been one of the best things to happen to me is an understatement, my mood has stabilized because I'm no longer chronically bored (and unable to focus on anything to rectify said boredom) and I'm no longer doing nothing and hyper-focused on how miserable I am. I've also settled into a steady dose of Methylphenidate ER 54mg which works well for me. 6 months ago my therapist would've said I absolutely suffered from depression, and today I'm excited to get out of bed in the morning and do my job or explore all the opportunities I have. This is all still a fairly new experience for me though, and I'm still learning as I go.    One of the problems I've always had in my relationships is that either I can't get attached at all, or I get completely over-attached. There is no in-between, and this is obviously not a desirable quality for relationships or romantic interests. While I've noticed my mood is much more stable and I'm no longer beating myself up about my failures, I'm still falling into the same pattern of just not being able to get "interested" in the right people, and becoming too attached to people that it's just not going to work with. I guess I could describe every relationship I've ever been in as complete puppy-dog love, in a way.    I'm wondering if anyone has any advice or experience with feeling the same way, and how they've overcome or managed it? I've gotten much better at managing my emotions and making smarter choices, but to some degree, I can't help how I feel.    **TL;DR**: I'm either 100% puppy dog love when it comes to relationships, or I can't even remotely get into a person. Thoughts?
