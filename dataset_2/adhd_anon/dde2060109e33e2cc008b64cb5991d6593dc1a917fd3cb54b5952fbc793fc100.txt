I can become very passionate about something and want to become an expert on it, and then become obsessed with it for a few hours to a month. This happens with a few things. Programming, Piano/guitar/singing, Running, and overcoming my social anxiety. Those are the things that come back at various times for the last few years. The longest I've stuck with something is piano, a few years of frequent on again off again practice. But with these things I will being really into them and then one day realize I haven't practiced for them in a while and stop caring about them for a few months. Is there anyway around losing focus, because I have these few very strong interests that I could become fairly competent at if only I stuck with them. I just heard someone playing piano beautifully through my dorm window which made me regret leaving my keyboard at home because now I can't practice it. But I had lost interest in practicing for the last 10 months or so.
