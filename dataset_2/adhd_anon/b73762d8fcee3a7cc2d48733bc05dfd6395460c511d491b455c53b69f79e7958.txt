Quinn;;;Dr. Quinn, and expert and speaker on ADHD, came to my university a few months ago and I thought I'd pass along the notes I took. I know it's lengthy but I learned a lot from this lecture. As a female who got diagnosed with ADHD in college, I can attest that so much makes sense and that this disorder extends further than I was aware of. I hope you guys find this as helpful as I have!  **EDIT!** Her lecture is available on iTunes for free. [This link](http://www.unc.edu/asp/ADHDinGirlsandWomenTheHiddenDisorder.htm) has her powerpoint slides from her lecture, the link to iTunes, and recommended books.   **Historical Impact on Gender Issues**  **What we looked AT, what we looked for predetermined what we found**  * mostly white male hyperactive subtype  * Separating Fact from Fiction*  * many similarities between the genders  * phenotypic core of ADHD symptoms similar to what has been observed in boys  * recent findings stress the severity of disorder in females  * more mood and anxiety disorders, less conduct disorder  * preponderance of inattentive symptoms  * 18 symptoms: 9 in inattentive, 9 in hyperactive/impulsive  * 6 out of 9 symptoms from specific category puts you in specified subtype, 6 of 9 out of any (each? sorry don't remember) puts you in combined  * comorbidity: anxiety result from ADHD  **How are differences manifested?**  * receive F in test: boy says test is stupid; girl says "I am stupid."  * boys externalize while girls internalize  * self-blame, self-attribution  * low self-esteem  * demoralization (looks like low level depression)  * moves into depression  **Need to Investigate Internalizing Patterns**  * internalizing patterns require much closer observation  * require self-report evaluations  **Mitigating Circumstances (especially important in understanding why girls go undiagnosed)**  * fewer ADHD symptoms  * grew up in a structured environment (high school; parents doing the organizing)  * high social economic status (can afford tutoring, academic coaches, etc.)  * no Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) or Conduct Disorder (CD)  * high IQ  * social pressure/need for approval  **Why learn about ADHD in women?**  **Undiagnosed ADHD is a significant health concern**  * 2nd most common psychological problem in adults  * affects 4 million women--most undiagnosed  * accidents/injuries  * abuse--psychological/physical/sexual abuse and trauma  * marital difficulties/sexual desires       -story: couple in the middle of getting it on, woman remembers that the kids need milk, LEAVES to go back. Needless to say the husband was upset. She didn't understand why.  * unplanned pregnancies       -distractability, not planning ahead, low self-esteem, not good at remembering to take birth control  * parenting problems--child with ADHD       -couldn't keep track of kids       -bad at problem solving--inflexible thinking, trouble figuring out alternative solutions  * poor self-esteem/depression/fibromyalgia       -ADHD meds also treat

bipolar disorder  * may be at greater risk for: chronic underachievement, smoking, substance abuse, pregnancy/STDs, driving problems  * girls are more likely to have taken anti-depressants when diagnosed with ADHD [boys-5% girls 14%)  **Program for Achieving Success**  * education (self-knowledge)  * self-advocacy  * support groups  * counseling/psychotherapy/family therapy  * creating an ADHD-friendly lifestyle  * medication  * improving organization skills/professional organizer  * coaching  * pursuing a healthy lifestyle  **Husbands**  * first one usually has OCD to overcompensate for lack of organization  * second one usually has ADHD because he understands from personal experience  * third one is usually just right for her  **Besides Medication**  * exercise (works for about 2-3 hrs)  * omega 3  * getting enough sleep  * academic coach  * yoga and meditation  **Treatment Issues for Girls**  * don't need as much "behavior management" issues  * peer issues more intense  **Medication Issues**  * anxiety and depression may need to be treated along with ADHD in adolescence  * ADHD treated first, 60% will no longer have anxiety/depression  * PMS issues  * premenstrual

first trimester  * genetic factors  * pesticide  * prematurity risk factor  * meningitis  * each child born from a mother with ADHD have a 50-60% chance of getting it  **At what point is it a disorder and not blame?**  * 9.6% of the population in the US and 9.3% in the rest of the world have it  * Japan has a lot of support groups  * we include inattentiveness, age, adolescents, and broadened the criteria so there are more people diagnosed  * two people with same problem: messy office--task: clean in one day       -person with no ADHD:            ~cleans office            ~has time to do other things (sign holiday cards/alphabetize things)       -person with ADHD            ~begins cleaning            ~sees dying plant            ~buys soil for it            ~doesn't finish cleaning            ~ends with messier office  * area for brain cannot be fully stimulated  * lack of motivation, not will  * great engine but no brakes  **Is medication needed?**  * it does play a major role  * starting early may prevent low self-esteem and anxiety/depression  * not needed if you're living an ADHD-friendly lifestyle  **Other Thoughts**  * decaffeinate yourself once you become medicated  * need 10 cups of coffee at once to be equivalent to medication (jittery, insomnia, anxiety side effects though)  * no lab test yet  * ADHD is not cured  * you can live well despite disorder  * ADHD friendly lifestyle may cultivate function w/ medication
