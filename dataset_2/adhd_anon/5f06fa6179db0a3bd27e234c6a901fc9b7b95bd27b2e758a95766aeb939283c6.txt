With that, I would like to ask the question, how does someone differentiate the difference between poor habits and ADHD? Especially when it comes to someone who is an adult and has never been diagnosed.  TL;DR: How does someone differentiate the difference between poor habits and ADHD?

Throughout my post secondary studies in physics, I have been struggling with sleep issues, and overall lack of focus, which led to doctors suggesting sleep issues, then a depression diagnosis and finally an ADHD diagnosis. Since being treated for ADHD, I feel like a better functioning me and my overall quality of life has improved significantly. However, one problem still remains and that is...  The diagnosis was made 8 years too late.  During the summer of 2015, I pursued an ADHD diagnosis by seeing a new psychiatrist on my own accord with little help of my previous psychiatrist who was fixated on my depression and social anxiety diagnosis. I do not disagree with her nor question her expertise and she made a valid diagnosis, but I felt that it was a result of the lack success in my life. On top of that, I received no help from the central mental health institution of my city (for those who know of it, it was CAMH) whose doctors believed that ADHD is hokum and since I was admitted to university I don't have ADHD. Along with this search, I was also being issued statements from my university that I am required to withdraw. This resulted in increased stress, anger towards life and the outcomes and most importantly, the destruction of my morale. I could also go on ranting about how university's forced withdrawal policies are utter nonsense, since it is not the university who is funding my education but rather myself, and I feel that I should have ultimate control over what I do with my own funds, but I digress.   Where I am at now (Begin here):  I have been diagnosed for a little over 6 months and been out of school for about 9 months and I have no motivation to go back into an environment of learning and discovery, an environment which I loved and was passionate about. I feel that this slump was attributed by the realization that the incline of the mountain of which I must travel upwards is now steeper than ever before. As it turns out, my high school credits have essentially expired and applying as a mature student is out of the question due to the outlandish requirements I must meet, such as:  &gt;Have demonstrated potential for success through academic, professional or volunteer activities and other accomplishments. &gt;Have a favourable academic record  I have no idea how to respond to these requirements. I mean, does working full time at a minimum wage retail job count as a successful attribute? I don't feel that it is. As for academic success requirement, I have no clue what to mention since my academic history has been torn to pieces with each failed attempt I made in the past.  I feel that I have hit rock bottom and that I am a token of the board game of Monopoly who just landed on the "Go To Jail" space of life where I do not pass Go, collect $200 and I am forced to skip three turns. I have been considering going back into my original degree of study (physics) and complete it, but I am anxious of the thought that history will repeat itself. Additionally, the thought of switching degrees and starting anew seems too daunting of a task since I will be essentially start from the bottom and the thought of wasting the past 8 years studying physics and leaving the path that I created for myself causes me to retract from this option. Furthermore, the thought of being 25 years old with little finances and no post secondary degree to show for worries me with each passing day and being forced to withdraw from university feels like life has pressed pause on me even though the cassette of life continues to play through.  **TL;DR** Diagnosed with ADHD late in life and I have lost the motivation to continue my education and I am fearful of the future. I need advice and a direction. Hopefully someone that was in a similar situation can provide insight of how he/she managed to escape this hole of low morale.  **EDIT**  Thanks to all who responded and offered suggestions and advice. I've been meaning to respond individually to each post but I have been busy with work lately. I will reply individually in the next day or two to thank and answer specific questions. In the mean time to answer some general questions:  1) I am a male   2) I am in Canada   3) I am eating healthy, better than before on medication because I'm not binge eating like I used to
