521878c19283a90e8b58790bb9da59301c4cd68d4a87516e6275af1abe2d5452;;;help;;;I've been sitting infront of my computer for the second night in a row without getting a single bit of work done.   Mainly I end up on facebook, reddit, and news sites. Tonight, I've literally been at my computer for the last 6 hours and gotten nothing done.  I have a 10 page paper that's past due and I haven't gotten past a half a page. I've already outlined everything. And I've got a good idea of where to get all the info I need. But I'm having a shit hard time actually DOING it. This is really rough. I haven't been this bad in a long time. Also, I'm sick with a cold i think, which may have something to do with it.
