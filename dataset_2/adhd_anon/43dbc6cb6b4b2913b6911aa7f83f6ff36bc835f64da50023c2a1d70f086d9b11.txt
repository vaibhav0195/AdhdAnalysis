I am almost positive that I have ADHD but I am afraid to go to a doctor and get diagnosed with it because of the cost of the medication. I really want to get my ADHD under control because my grades are suffering greatly but I'm worried about the cost of the medication. I fear that it will cost too much and my parents will not be able to afford it every time I need to refill my medication. What is the general cost of medication, and are there any cheaper forms of medication to keep it under control?  TLDR: What is the general cost of medication, and are there any cheaper forms of medication to keep it under control?
