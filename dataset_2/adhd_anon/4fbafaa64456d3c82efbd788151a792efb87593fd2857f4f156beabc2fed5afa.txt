4fbafaa64456d3c82efbd788151a792efb87593fd2857f4f156beabc2fed5afa;;;Getting Medication?;;;I was diagnosed with ADHD back when I was in school. I have been off meds for quite an while. However, I am having trouble performing and focusing at work and at home, so I spoke with my doctor about ADHD meds.  He told me that I would need to speak with a psychiatrist in order to get a prescription for something like adderal. He then prescribed me welbutrin and said that it should help, since he thinks that I am depressed. I tried to tell him that if I am depressed it is because I cant focus due to ADHD. However I trusted his opinion and took the welbutrin. It has not helped.  Is this normal, and do most of you guys need to see a psychiatrist to get prescribed ADHD medication?
