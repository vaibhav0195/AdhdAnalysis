It's difficult for me to evaluate it's effects on my ability to focus. I think it works somewhat (I am considering supplementing it with IR later in the day) but I have been reading threads where people say "medication x did nothing for me, but y was like a whole new world". I'm worried that I am just feeling the positive effects of taking a stimulant and there is probably a medication out there that would be perfect for me. I would like to ask my doctor if he could prescribe me a variety of medications to evaluate over the course of a few months but I don't know if doctors dig that kind of thing.   also: I have been diagnosed with SCT and apparently medication is not as effective for treating it, but I may have comorbid ADHD that the medication may be helping.  TL;DR  I feel some improvement of my symptoms with my current medication, but I'm wondering if there are meds out there that would work better. and if so: how do I go about finding out?
