58ac6ae845d881c7c5c6dd47040fbebc3ab76569f76bc9a03775e5d7cd0ebe34;;;Dr. Amens 6 types of ADD, anyone else diagnosed by this system?;;;I had brain scans and then diagnosed with ADHD type 6  Iv'e noticed most people go by a different ADD classing system so I was wondering what your thoughts are on Dr. Amens.  http://add.about.com/od/adhdthebasics/a/Interview-With-Dr-Daniel-Amen.htm  I think the description describes me pretty well but as I haven't seen anyone else on here reference him I question his legitimacy.
