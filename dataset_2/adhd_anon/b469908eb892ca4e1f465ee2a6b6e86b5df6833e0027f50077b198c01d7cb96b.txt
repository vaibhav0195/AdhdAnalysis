What Do You Do About It?;;;I’ve never went for a diagnosis or actually spoken to a doctor other than asking if Modafinil was right for me and trying that out for a bit with little success.   For roughly six years I have been working in a career that has been hit hard from my issues. There are minor issues on the job that result from inability to focus on tasks or stay in one particular spot. I struggle with the more complex tasks involved in my job while I thrive in the faster paced, physical tasks. Unfortunately latter is generally the menial tasks. However the biggest problem is my inability to advance my career. I’ve tried countless times to hit the books and study for the many exams I face when trying to move up the ladder. I’ve taken countless courses which have all seems like failures. I’ve had such little success that it’s taken a psychological toll on me. Failing at advancing myself while seeing all my colleagues around me moving up and passing me by. It’s something that has bothered me for years, everyday. It eats at me. It’s led to a lot of questions and confusion in my life. “Should I even bother anymore? Should I just cut my loses now even though I’ve spent six years working at it? Is this why my life is so miserable?” I don’t know what to do. I get by but throughout my life things have always been tough because of this.   I want to talk to a doctor but I’m currently staying in a different city where a family doctor or walk in clinic probably wouldn’t help me much nor do I have the time at the moment. Has anyone seemed help from other professional sources? Would counselling be beneficial?  Thanks a lot,  Have a good day.
