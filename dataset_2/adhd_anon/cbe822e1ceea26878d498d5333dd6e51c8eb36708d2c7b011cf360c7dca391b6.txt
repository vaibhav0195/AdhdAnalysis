This should be my last year in college as an engineering major, however, due to my inadequate study habits, I'm about the equivalent to beginning my junior year. I have always loved designing and 3d printers and taking things apart so I know this is what I want to do but having to retake so many classes has me questioning if I'll ever graduate before I run out of student loan opportunities. I feel that even if I do graduate, will I even be able to hold down a job because of my forgetfulness and lack of attention?      On the other hand, my friends, family, and significant other just don't get it. They all think I'm just lazy and unmotivated and say that I use ADD as a cop-out for being irresponsible. I tell then that , no, waking up at 11 and not being able to think until 1 is not something I do because I don't care, it's a curse when you have to fit into a society like this. Sometimes I wish that I was like that because I wouldn't feel like such a fuck up when I failed at simple things (like remembering to close the garage door) yet alone advanced math and science. My mother and father have been supportive in the sense that they allowed me to get diagnosed 7 years ago but they believe I'm in it for the drugs (adderall IR 20mg 3 times a day). All of this stuff occurs even though I'm medicated. If I go without meds it's like I'm in the clouds all day and I'll even stop speaking mid-sentence because I get distracted so bad. I question whether there is a place in the world that someone like me can live and be happy. I don't know what to do with myself anymore and I can't see life getting any better when I have more responsibility. Sorry for the long post if you made it this far.
