Some people I know have actually been tested (TOVA or some form of CPT), but most often it's been a shrink/doctor asking them questions.  And then once medicated (or whatever), the measurement is also squishy (you feel better or worse), hard to quantify how how it's impacting you.  I just found out about PEBL, an open-source system for creating psych tests, including ones used for ADD like TOVA and Connor's CPT-II.  The downside is you won't get the norms and the indexes that are part of the process when take the official tests.  On the other hand, you can take the tests as often as you want and get data on your own performance unmedicated vs. medicated (and different levels/meds).  Some of you might find it very interesting, check it out.  ETA: http://pebl.sourceforge.net/
