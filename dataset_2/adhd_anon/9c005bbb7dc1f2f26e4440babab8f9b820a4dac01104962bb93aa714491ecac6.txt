I started medication  shortly after and that helped me function enough to not only finish highschool, but even with decent grades.  I'm now 22, and after a two and a half years without I started up on Ritalin again a week ago.   Something I was hoping the Ritalin would help me with is the issue that   I'm most ashamed over. I can't clean my room nor hold it tidy. I love clean rooms, order and everything, I just can't find the power to actually do it.   After moving out and getting my own room at college it's really destroying my confidence. I'm not the most clean cut guy, but with the mess that is my room, I just look like a lazy slob.   Does anyone else struggle with this problem? Got any tips on how to get over it?   Tl;dr: ¯\(°_o)/¯ How do clean room?
