53d6a57f0bc382d02cd53fc74087f8f7764c77906176970ee7fce1c358074071;;;I have ADHD and chose not to take medication for it until this year (3d year university).  Ask me anything.;;;I am now on 36mg tabs of concerta and have been for eight months.  I was raised by a psychologist mother who dealt with me incredibly well and showed me I do not need the drugs.  I was first diagnosed when I was 8 years old. They have improved the quality of my life greatly though and I made the right decision to begin taking concerta- but I made the decision as an adult- my parents chose to let me decide for myself and when I turned 18 I chose not to take drugs.  Only now (22) have I decided that for my last year and a half of university I should test the medication out.  Ask me anything you like and I will do my best to help.
