I will be talking to a doctor about medication next Tuesday.  My question for you guys is if you guys have trouble in larger groups of people.  I feel like my brain wants to be social and converse with everyone but I'm always finding myself thinking about things to say to an point where I don't really say much and feel really awkward.  However, in smaller groups I feel that I can talk a lot more freely.  In a nutshell, I just want to know if medication could relieve some of my inner tension.   TL;DR - For those who zone out in large groups of friends/people, do meds help with your social skills?  Thanks guys! Looking forward to visiting this subreddit more often!
