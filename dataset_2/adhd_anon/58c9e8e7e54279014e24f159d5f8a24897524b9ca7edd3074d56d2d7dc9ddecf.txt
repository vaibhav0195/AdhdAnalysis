I officially reveived a diagnosis of ADHD about an hour ago and I feel so relieved to finally know. I want to give thanks to all of you here, for this subreddit has been my home away from home while going through the journey of finding out the root cause of so many of my issues.  I got a prescription for Concerta and I was wondering about other peoples experiences with this medication? I haven't taken my first dose yet.   Again, thank you!
