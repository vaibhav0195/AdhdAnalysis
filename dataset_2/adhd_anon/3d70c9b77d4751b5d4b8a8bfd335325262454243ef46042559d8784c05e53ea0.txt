I have worked with students with ADHD in the past, and have just begun a new job with a number of adolescents with the diagnosis. This time around, I would like to work on skills that would be directly useful for my students in adulthood. I've read literature about work with adolescents with ADHD, but in trying to get a more genuine idea of what might be useful to work on, I wondered what you all had to say: What do you wish someone would have taught you as a kid to cope better as an adult? This can be in a social, professional or personal context.   Edit: Thank you SO MUCH for your responses, everyone! I appreciate your willingness to share your experiences here.
