Sometimes funny, sometimes potentially tragic.  Is this common?  Before I got diagnosed with ADHD, I often thought I had some form of extremely early Alzheimer's disease, cause I used to work with Alzheimer's patients and sometimes, I felt just about as lost.  In the last few weeks before I started to take meds, It got so bad that I kept apologizing to people for being so 'out of it'.  My favourite excuse was 'wow, I am not awake yet, I need coffee', no matter what time of day.  It felt embarrassing because I started feeling like it made me look like I was mentally challenged or something, when in fact I am actually gifted.    If I went for groceries, I'd forget that the cashier handed me my bags and just blankly stare at her waiting for them, when in fact I've been holding them the whole time.  Urgh!   *By the way, sorry for the mistakes, English is not my first language.
