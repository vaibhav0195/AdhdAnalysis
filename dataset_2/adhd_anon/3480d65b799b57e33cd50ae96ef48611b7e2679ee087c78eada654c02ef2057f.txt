3480d65b799b57e33cd50ae96ef48611b7e2679ee087c78eada654c02ef2057f;;;New to bupropion;;;I was diagnosed with ADHD 12 years ago and have been on Concerta for years. I also have a bit of anxiety and depression and was prescribed Sertraline in middle school. I recently realized how low my sex drive is and my doctor switched me from the Sertaline to Bupropion. He told me that it can also be useful in treating ADHD. So here's my question: has anyone else had a similar experience (taking ADHD meds and an anti-depressant, then switched to Bupropion/Wellbutrin). Did you find that you didn't really need the Concerta/Adderall, etc anymore or did you have to continue taking it to treat your ADHD?
