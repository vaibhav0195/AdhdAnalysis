What are some of the tips you would like to share.   1) I am hitting a wall with my advisor, who is annoyed with the procrastination.  2) I almost always hit the deadline paper submission deadlines without completion. The I either send a paper unfinished or dont send it at all. It has been very frustrating.  3) I have always end up over committing to a number of projects and end up disappointing people.  4) I have maintained a list of ideas that I have had. The problem is I have never published any one them.   Its my 5th year and I want to finish this and get on with a real life and real job!   EDIT: I am not yet officially  diagnosed, although I have had the symptoms growing up until now. The psychological counsellor at my university has asked me to join the  group counselling esp for ADHD in my university in the coming semester   I am specifically looking for advice on coping with the symptoms without medication.   EDIT 2: Thanks you r/ADHD for such wonderful advice. I think I have found what I was looking for .
