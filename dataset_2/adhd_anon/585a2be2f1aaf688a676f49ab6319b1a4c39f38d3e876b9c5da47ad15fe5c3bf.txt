I wanted your thoughts on medication. All of you were very helpful. I did start my child on meds and have been on that hamster wheel since.  I was initally concerned about "throwing" medications at a problem for all the reasons people worry. Many of you assured me it did help and I wanted to by guided by his need rather than my notions.  We started with Adderall. WHAT A DIFFERENCE. I went from a withdrawn, anxious, angry child to one that smiled, engaged with life and people. He was feeling good and doing well in school. I cannot overstate the improvements I saw in his person and esteem.  But then he grew and doses did too. We switched to Ritalin and now those doses have grown too. I'm told he is still on a low dose but I am super frustrated with doctors and prescribing and a lack of guidance/education on our options. I worry about giving my child progressively larger doses of amphetamines. Perhaps that is my ignorance but the last prescription I got was for a 24 hr release (ER). Neither him nor I need him on Ritalin during hours when he should be sleeping.  I wanted to come to you guys again for your thoughts since they were so helpful to me last time. Have others been through similar experiences, struggled with similar worries about achieving the best balance? Have others have found alternate therapies that work well?  As always, I appreciate all input.
