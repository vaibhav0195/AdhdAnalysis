At first I thought I was very unlucky. Then I started thinking I was making bad career choices. Then I noticed the only common factor was me, and started blaming myself.  (And now I think it's probably ADHD....while still feeling like it's my fault / responsibility)   &amp;nbsp;   Thing is, I've lost all motivation. I quit my last job a year ago and I've been doing a little freelance work here and there, but mostly I'm just whining and feeling stuck / like crap. I went back to my parents' place but it's not going very well, and I can't blame them for wanting me to "wake up" and "get on with my life".   &amp;nbsp;   I feel like there is no job out there that will satisfy me, ever. I see hurdles and frustration everywhere, which is why it's so hard to get started. I understand it's more of a mindset problem than an actual career issue, which is why I'm posting here... Could also be a self esteem / confidence problem. After all my past failures, how can I possibly believe that there's anything good out there?  &amp;nbsp;   **TL;DR: Every career option looks frustrating / not worth the effort / full of red flags.**  **Have you ever faced similar issues? Do you have tips on finding your groove again?**   &amp;nbsp;  I'm open to reading millions of books / watchings hours of videos / working with a coach (so if you can recommend one &amp; they work with Skype that'd be awesome).
