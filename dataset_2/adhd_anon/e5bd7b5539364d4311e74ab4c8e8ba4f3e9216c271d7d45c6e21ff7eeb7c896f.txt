I've been happy and sad and everything in between.  Like many ADHDer's I get overwhelmed by negative emotions and have trouble pushing through and need a way to 'cool off' and reset.  &amp;nbsp;  But even from a young age I've often felt emotionally detached.  &amp;nbsp;  I can sometimes really be charismatic and enjoyable to be around, but the majority of the time I'm a robot.  I was actually first mis-diagnosed with Aspergers.  &amp;nbsp;  According to my family, when I was very young, I had one stuffed animal that I would always have around with me.  However, I lost it somewhere and never saw it again.  Not once did I cry, or even acknowledge that it was missing.  It's as if I just forgot that I even had an emotional attachment to that soft and comforting toy animal.  PS: I'm somewhere between ADHD inattentive and combined subtypes.  Probably relevant.
