The problem lies in that at the beginning of the summer I was tasked to write a review paper and to get some results on experiments and around the same time my previous psychiatrist wanted me to try wellbutrin (she was running me through non-stimulants for some reason). The wellbutrin had left me very unfocused and moody and when quitting it I felt incredibly depressed/unmotivated and its been 2 almost 3 months since I was tasked to work on this.  Reading papers feels like hell and I'm trying to trudge through it but it takes forever. I know I'm on my last limb and my professor has probably already already decided to not renew my contract as is. Is it advisable that I tell my adviser what my issues are and see if she will work with me or should I just keep trying my hardest and tell her I don't have the work done? Any advice would very much help.   TL;DR : Lots of procrastination in combination with psych refusal to give stimulants. Could lose job/school. Should I talk to professor about problem?
