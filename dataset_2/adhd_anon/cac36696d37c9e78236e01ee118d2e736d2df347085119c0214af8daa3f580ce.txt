Recently, I have been talking to my pediatrician regarding medication. He recommended me first trying to take caffeine in the morning as a mild stimulant to see the effect. He recommended a simple non-prescription 100mg pill in the morning, and doubling the dose if no results are apparent.    I took 1 pill every other day for a week with no results. However, when I took 200mg I felt less creative, and slightly more able to focus. For several hours I lost the ability to daydream, which was strange because I always like to do so at my job when work slows down. I felt like a machine, ticking away. It felt very strange for the first time. The focusing effect was very mild, compared to my lack of creativity. Overall, I do not know how much it would help me in my daily life.    Has anyone else's doctor recommended this? If so, what is the next step? I have an appointment with my doctor tomorrow, but I don't have any other observations to go back to him with other than these experiences.  Thanks for your help :)
