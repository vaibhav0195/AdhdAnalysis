Towards the end of high school i didnt like that i had to rely on my medication so i stopped , but after my grades dropped drastically i started to take them again for my final exams and managed to get a decent pass and make it into university.   Now im in university and im at the point where if i dont take my medication i know that if i dont start taking my medication regularly im going to fail my course but i dont like that i have to rely on the medication to make me 'normal'. As it stands right now its 4:30pm on the day before i have my part for 2 of my assignments due and i havent started any of them because ive procrastinated all week. So this is something that i know if i dont get on regular medication soon im not going to accomplish anything in my adult life once im in the 'real world'. Ive tried researching alternative methods and tips on dealing with it, but i just cant see how breathing techniques or checklists are effective when ive tried and failed.  tl;dr i guess my question is how do overcome this and get my life on track. I need to get better but i feel like i cant surpass this by myself without the medication, and even then i feel its barely enough.  EDIT: thanks for the advice guys, if i dont end up overcoming this soon ill probably go back on meds like you all suggested. however for the mean time ill see if i can make it without
