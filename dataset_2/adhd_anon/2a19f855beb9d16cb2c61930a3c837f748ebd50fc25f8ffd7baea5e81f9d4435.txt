(just sharing happy stuff);;;**TL;DR I have ADHD, my life suddenly make sense, it can only get better!**  I read an account online a week or so back, and thought "WTF, this is my life!" And everyone was recommending that this person got checked for adult ADHD. So, I kept reading and reading, and I identify with all symptoms of inattentive ADHD.    My life makes so much more sense now.   I am trying medication (concetra 27mg, no side effects yet), and so far it's working, for an hour or 4, 5. After that I zone out for 2 hours or so, and then I'm back to relatively normal. Well, my old normal.    I'm realizing now that how I feel in the mornings is how real normal people feel all the time. I'm amazed and relieved. I feel like I can maybe finally achieve something real in my life.    Bonus points is that I have more energy, and less appetite. Hopefully that'll help doing exercise and losing weight.   I also never realized how much tension and anxiety (physical) I am carrying around all day, every day, until suddenly it was gone for a few hours...   It'll probably take a few months before we find the exact right medicine for me, but that's ok. I know it can only get better from here on out!
