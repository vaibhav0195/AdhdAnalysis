I did not even new about such thing as ADHD/ADD before I came here. All my life I was blaming myself for not working hard enough for all the failures I had. Long story short, thanks to this amazing sub reddit and internet, I suspect that I have ADD and I want to get help but I don't know any one here. Can you please suggest me a good physiatrist AND/OR anything where I can go for diagnosis and treatment.   Also, my humble apology if this is not the right place to ask this question but I was not sure where else I can go for help.  P.S. I have health insurance from my employer.
