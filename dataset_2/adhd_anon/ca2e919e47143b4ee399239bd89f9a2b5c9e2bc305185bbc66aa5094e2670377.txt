What are your thoughts regarding ADHD and vulnerability? How do you change your ways so you're not so vulnerable?;;;I just thought about this, but I feel like ADHD is connected to vulnerability and innocence and naivety which makes us easy targets for bullies while growing up and makes it hard for us to do things like read between the lines (regardless of age), that it's hard to balance group relationships even if we're the extroverted type, and that people can take advantage of us because we tend to be sensitive/wear our hearts on our sleeves and don't always understand social cues.  Additionally, we may forget the things people say or do because of our memory issues...Do you agree with this?  Also, I just wanted to ask a few more questions regarding ADHD?  * How do you think ADHD affects your social life and interpersonal relationships?    * What are your thoughts regarding ADHD and vulnerability?    * How do you change your ways so you're not so vulnerable?  * How to improve reading between the lines?
