I've found a few things like that for everyone 1 woman diagnosed there are 5 men, women are far more likely not to get diagnosed until adulthood (like myself).   But I'd really like to hear from some of the women on this subreddit on what they perceive to be the primary differences between female and male ADHD, how they are perceived by others, how they believe their symptoms manifest compared to our male counterparts, how it effects your relationships, do you think there is more or less stigma for women with ADHD? Any fun facts?  I'm just really curious :)
