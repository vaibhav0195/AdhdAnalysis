I've always laughed it off until now.   SPECIFICS:  I look back at most of the issues I have had in my life prior to all of this and realize that many of my struggles are probably derived from this. One of these is just in general becoming a non-talkative person because I have always had trouble focusing on what I need to say rather than what I am thinking about simultaneously. It's like I have two brains going at the same time. I actually have a fucking LOT to say, but I just can't get it out because it's too much info to spit out at once. My mouth can't move that fast lol. I've set up a psychiatric evaluation, so we'll see if this is what it is. This is only one example out of a plethora of personal struggles that I have always battled with.  QUESTION: But I was interested especially in those of you who were adults when diagnosed, what specific situations you had trouble with before realizing that it was ADHD or ADD? The things you just dismissed or battled yourself with?
