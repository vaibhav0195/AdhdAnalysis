If not does anyone have good resource for finding someone good? I have not had much luck just googling around.  I got really lucky the last place i lived, found a great psychiatrist and have been working out how to medicate with her, and feeling like I am making some progress.  I have managed to keep prescriptions filled on my occasional work trips back home, but I would really like to find someone here.   So does anyone local have a doctor they like, or at least a bit of advice on where to start looking.
