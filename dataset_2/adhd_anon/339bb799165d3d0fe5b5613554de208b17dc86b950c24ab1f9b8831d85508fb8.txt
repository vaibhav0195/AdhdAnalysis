What is in store for me in the over the coming weeks/months/years?;;;I haven't really noticed any differences yet, but I haven't tried doing any school work/ reading yet either, so i'm not sure I would notice right away anyway.  My prescription was only 10 MG because my doctor wanted to start me off slow, she told me to come back in a month to discuss how it effects me and then we can talk about an increase of dosage.  All of my life I have had major attention deficit issues, and I am so happy to finally be doing something about it. I'm sure a lot of you know how I felt before, having major issues retaining information from conversations/readings, having an incredibly short attention span, and not being able to pay attention to anything for more then a few minutes.  When will I notice any changes? How will I know if I need an increased dosage? Should I not take adderall during the weekends?   I just turned 18, if that changes anything.
