I've been chasing this dream since I was young and have sacrificed friends, jobs, and a relationship to try and join.   However, after 22 months of recruitment/MEPS purgatory, I finally got the call this week. PDQ due to ADHD.   It's been difficult not to think of myself as defective or broken. It's taken a lot to get here and I realize now I have put aside a lot of growing up and learning because I chased this dream. I feel condemned by this diagnosis/decision.   Anyone have any advice or had a similar experience where they thought they felt this way?
