I recently got diagnosed and was prescribed Dexedrine.  My doctor told me he had to charge me $20 to "write it on this special pad" and that it wasn't covered by my insurance.  So it had to be 100% out of pocket.   Then I took my 'script to the pharmacy, so it's not like the charge was to actually fill the prescription.  This is completely new and very strange to me as I have really amazing insurance ($0 co-pay for visits or medication).      I tried to google, but it's pretty hard to find any related information and I don't know anyone else in CA that will openly discuss their ADHD diagnosis or medication.   Is this normal, just a California thing, or is my doctor up to something duplicitous.  **TL;DR: Is my California doctor jerking me around by charging me extra to write prescriptions?**
