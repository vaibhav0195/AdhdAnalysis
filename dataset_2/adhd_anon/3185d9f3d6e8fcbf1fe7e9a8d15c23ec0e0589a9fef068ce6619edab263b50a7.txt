Seriously my life has been so far really bad. I remember I became so emotionally unstable that I live manically for many years cause I could manipulate my emotions. But then, disaster struck, someone got under my skin, was super negative, and then I developed intrusive thoughts where I imagined how they judged me and told me I was a failure, and I could not fight these "voices" off, whenever I would do well, the thoughts would just correct me so that I couldnt do as well next time. and there I was, forced to see myself break apart right in front of me with no one to help me, I couldnt even explain it cause the voices told me I couldnt. It got so bad that I was terrified of spilling my coffee when I got it. took me seven long and painful years just to finally be able to go to college. took the easy route as that was the only one that worked for me. I am so lost... I am almost 30, my heart is broken from all those lost possibilities I have had, and I have nowhere to go.  part of me wants to go crazy and start ruining things, I am emotionally stunted as thats the only way for me to go about without getting hurt. I am almost becoming an alcoholic. I got nothing in life. I cant even let myself think too much due to the shit ive emtionally gone through.  I am so lost.
