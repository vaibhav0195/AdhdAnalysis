e181059b902ea8d09ff5fb795828880b9770097d8086fe4fdf8507cf51ac5ac0;;;Does anyone here know anything about/have SCT?;;;Has anyone here ever heard of SCT (sluggish cognitive tempo)? I was diagnosed as ADHD inattentive my senior year of high school, but most of what read about ADHD doesn't seem to wholly apply to me or leaves out my worst symptoms. This SCT condition seems to perfectly describe me so far. Does anyone know anything about it? I am having a really hard time in college, and most of the advice i find is geared toward ADHD with hyperactivity. Any info or advice you guys could provide would be a huge help.
