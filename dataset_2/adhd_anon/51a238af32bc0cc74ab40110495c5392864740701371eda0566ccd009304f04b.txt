There is no efficacy on CBT helping in ADHD, but I would like some personal anecdotes of people who've gone through it.  Personal ways &amp; mechanisms you've used to increase your wellbeing, emotional intelligence, memory, productive output. Share them!   This is a pretty saturated topic, I know, but I wanted to get some fresh responses on this. It is always good to go back and take a look at the basics of how everyone is dealing with it. Hopefully we all learn a thing or two out of this.
