How do I tell her I think I can change her life?;;;My mum had a bit of a crap childhood. It made sense to me that she's an intense person because she felt abandoned by her own parents and experienced some childhood trauma. But, having discovered ADHD myself and seeking a diagnosis, I believe I got it from both her AND my dad. Unfortunately, she's so oblivious to anything (inattentive) that she's never admitted that our family was a bit strange. She has incredibly low self-confidence and fears ending up as a crazy old woman in a dark room watching tv for the rest of her life. Yet, she continues to do nothing about it, instead drinking a bottle of wine by herself several nights a week. I've been seeking help in the past and I opened up to her about it, and she, showing some concern simply said "there's nothing wrong with you". This is because she hasn't grown up in a stable environment with normal people so her perception is skewed. I've ordered Driven To Distraction, so far my idea is to sit her down, no TV on in the background and say "Mum, I think I can change our lives" and talk to her about how I think I have ADHD and how I think she and my brother might too. Does that sound good?
