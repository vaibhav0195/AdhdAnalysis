I usually take my 3rd dose sometime after 3 before 6. Today I took it at 4:45-5. I swallowed it with a gulp of water and didn't think much of it. Well, fast foward to 8:15 in math and I'm not feeling anything, I feel the fog. I was getting distracted. I was clearly not on it at all. I then remembered that i had a water bottle..chugged half of it, and 5 minutes later I feel like the adderall hit. Is this a thing? Or am I making this up and I just have myself all psyched out for nothing..
