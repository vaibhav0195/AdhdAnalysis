4ccbdb3ca15cf3bf67c0c5405d55ab6594e26bd4b35f99e19676b99d08ac419a;;;Creativity and ADHD?;;;Out of most of my friends, I feel like I'm one of the most creative. Ever since I was little I used to be great at lying because I could make a believable story up on the spot. I have a lot of creativeness when it comes to art, I just can never get my hand to go where my mind is. I almost always can create/design useful tools to help me out (though i rarely get around to making them).  Is anyone else with ADHD really creative? Does ADHD have a link to creativity or am i just pulling this out of my gluteus maximus?
