I was diagnosed with ADHD as a child, when I was a bit of a shit-disturber, to say th least. Apparently, my Doctor also thinks I have anxiety, but I'm not worried about it - no pun intended.   In the Spring, my Doctor boosted my dose of my medication, Stratera, as I had grown and needed a larger dose to meet my needs.  Right now I am taking 4 x 18mg of *Mylan-Atomoxetine* (Stratera) and I find that it does next to nothing when it comes to helping me focus.  I keep wanting to go to the gym and work out, but when I have the opportunity, I usually just say "fuck it" and stuff my face. I find that I am socially awkward with my meds, and I didn't use to be before I started taking them.  So my question is: should I consult my doctor to see if a different medication would help me focus more / not procrastinate?  Thanks for sticking through the longer read.
