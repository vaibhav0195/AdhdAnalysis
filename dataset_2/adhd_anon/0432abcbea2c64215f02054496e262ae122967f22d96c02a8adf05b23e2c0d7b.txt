I was diagnosed with ADHD 2 years ago and have been on 10mg Adderall XR for 1 year.  I just got back from the doctor for the third time this week.  I've had jaw pain and swelling on the left side for four days, it hurts to chew solid foods, and after FINALLY getting to see my own doctor (Pain started on Sunday, then MLK day, my doc out of town for the long weekend, blahblah) was finally diagnosed with Salivary Gland Stones.  Apparently, though there can be several causes, they're linked to reduced salivary production from medications like stimulants, antihistamines, etc.  I can tell you, the pain is a real bummer and the swelling is messing up my pretty face. :)  Good news is that the prescription is lots of water and CANDY to promote salivary production and try to flush the thing out on its own.  Otherwise, it's minor, though sucky, surgery.  TL;DR Hydrate well while on stimulant medications and suck on hard candies for good measure.  Learn from my pain. :)
