Despite my student's shaky foundation in maths, he is incredibly enthusiastic and I would like to do as much as I can to help him achieve his dream of becoming an engineer.   I am currently studying a health care-related course so I've learned a fair bit about the science surrounding ADHD but I would like to hear about your personal experiences and advice on what helped you study. (I have also read the posts listed [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/17uf60/adhd_alltime_bestof_and_faq_thread_no_karma/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/21rvcg/these_studying_tricks_ive_made_up_are_the_only/) so far but I would like the opportunity to engage in discussions and receive constructive criticism on the strategies I've employed so far.)  I've tried to list the details in dot point so it's (hopefully) not too overwhelming.  **Background of student**  * 16 year old male student  * diagnosed with ADHD in January this year * Medication: Ritalin. 2 tablets in the morning, 1 in the afternoon.  * Takes the morning tablets routinely, sometimes forgets in the afternoon * Loves the guitar and gives lessons once a week. * His inability to focus in previous years has lead to a shaky foundation in basic mathematics - algebra.  **His strong points**  * Enthusiastic and willing to ask questions at school and with me. (His teachers comment that his face lights up when he understands a concept in class!) * He is determined to do well in maths and physics.  * He is great at questions requiring reasoning and picks up the associated concepts with ease e.g. geometry, trigonometry.   **My concerns**   * While he understands concepts in isolation, he has a huge problem identifying patterns in questions and their subsequent application e.g. difference of two squares.   * e.g. expanding x^2 - y^2 is no problem but if I ask him to rationalise the denominator of 1/(âˆš3 + 1), he will not automatically remember to use the same method.  * He is on the slow side when it comes to mental arithmetic.  * He has days where he feels 'grumpy' and does not take well to doing set homework.   * Poor exam technique e.g. spends lots of time on questions offered few marks and too little on bigger questions. Often gives up when feeling overwhelmed  **Strategies that have been put into place**  * Since his first exam, I have had a sit down with him to improve his exam technique, including how questions are marked and the structure of exam questions.  * I have helped him set up a weekly schedule to match his school timetable (week A and week B) and account for equal hours of study to each subject, recreational time, etc.  * His teacher at school is also the head teacher of Mathematics and so she and I are working on a two-part support system to boost his maths skills throughout this year.    * His paediatrician has recommended dropping one subject once he reaches year 12 so that he can focus on fewer subjects. There is also the option of retaking the final maths and physics exams after an extra year of study if his marks are not adequate.   * His parents enforce a no-computer after dinner policy but dinner time can be variable.  * They also enforce a system whereby he and his sister take the dog for a walk after they come back from school to help him wind down.  **Strategies I am considering**  I was finally able to meet up with his teacher today and will be changing up my lesson plan.   Previously, I used to provide homework help, revise concepts he did not understand and push ahead with concepts so that it would click for him in class.   I have been assured that his teacher would be happy to take on this role so I now have an hour and a half per week to use as I see fit.  * I am thinking of solely focusing on algebra and mental calculation to improve his efficiency at solving problems.  * Due to his weak computational skills, I am considering starting him on the Kumon method. My mother used this for me back in the day and I feel that it would be useful when gathering like terms, etc instantaneously.  Thank you for reading this and I greatly appreciate your feedback.  TL;DR My student is very behind in maths and I'd like to tailor my lessons to suit him. Were there any study strategies that helped you through high school?  Edit: I've also just read [this link](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1a8n55/studying_tipshelp/c8v4qgy) and am trying to figure out how to devise a method of enforcing this.
