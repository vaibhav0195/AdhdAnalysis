I like to tell people about what ADHD is really like. And I was wondering if there are some things you guys would like me to make sure people know.;;;I'm not asking you to write my material. Just some points to bring up. Things like,   1). ADHD isn't just about seeing a squirrel or something shiny.   2). It's like not having a filter. My body is like a bad older brother that makes me do stuff to get me in trouble. My Brian is like should I draw a penis on this wall? By the time I decide it's a bad idea there's 50 little dongs on the wall.   3). Appear lazy. Not on purpose.   4). Medications and why we need it.   This isn't my finial material. I just want people to know what ADHD is really like.
