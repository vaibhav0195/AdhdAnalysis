Im not a person to chug soda or energy drinks all day just in the morning to get my caffeine fix. So when is it ok to have a morning coffee or anything after i have taken my Adderall in the morning?

On my days off work i like to lift some weights an hour after taking my dose when i get a rush from it going into my system, which my doc and i have come to the conclusion its because of my fast metabolism and my blood concentration of the drug goes down faster than normal. Anyways i know my limits as to not over exhert myself and strain something. But i really want to know if going on a 45 minute run would be ok or is it dangerous even though i know my limit since i was a 3 year varsity cross country runner in hs? I have looked it up and most say its bad because you can over-strain yourself and your cardio system.
