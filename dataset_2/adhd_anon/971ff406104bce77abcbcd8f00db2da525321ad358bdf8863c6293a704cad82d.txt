I'm really scared by posting this question because I don't want to seem like someone who doubt about adhd. I have it, take my pills and do my things but I do have something in my head and needed to see what other thinks about it.*  I was thinking the other day about the fact that my pills help me coping with long hours of work on the computer and it got my to a question...  *What happen if we take a world adventurer and suddenly change is job to being an accountant?*  My guess it that he will show some symptoms like inattention mistakes over the monthâ€¦  I was told that ADD people have irregulated level of dopamine in the body. I agree on that but I was asking myself if there is there any thought/theory out there about level of dopamine in link with activities/lifestyle?
