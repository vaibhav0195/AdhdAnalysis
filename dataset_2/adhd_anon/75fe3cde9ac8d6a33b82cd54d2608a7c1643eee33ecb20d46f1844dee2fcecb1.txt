75fe3cde9ac8d6a33b82cd54d2608a7c1643eee33ecb20d46f1844dee2fcecb1;;;Does anyone else find ADHD has effected relationships with boyfriends/girlfriends/SOs? Please share (positive or negative)!;;;I am 25 years old, had ADHD since I was a kid but just got diagnosed. Once I acknowledged I had ADHD I began to realize that certain behaviors really impacted my relationship.  I am dating a really sweet girl, but she is so calm and a home-body type  etc I can't stand it some times. She is wonderful, but doesn't have that same need for stimulus that I have.   As I look back, most of the things we disagree about (or very rarely fight about) stem from this in some way.   Has anyone else with ADHD experienced this, and do you have advice on working through it? Any thoughts on perhaps needing to be with someone with a more energetic nature?
