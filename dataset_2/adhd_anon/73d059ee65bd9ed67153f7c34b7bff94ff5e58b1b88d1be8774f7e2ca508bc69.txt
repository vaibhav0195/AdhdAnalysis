(Kinda long, sorry);;;So, I spoke with my therapist at my last session and finally broke down and explained to her my troubling situation.   I had been holding back.  Not just a little either, I held back a lot. Things like my inability for math, writing, and reading. These are things we obviously all have issues with, so it is normal, right?   Unfortunately for me, no. It is a little weirder than normal as I learned! We started with math as that is something I had told her I'm the past was one of my least favorite classes. So, I told her my fear of letters as numbers. I am genuinely afraid of a letter being used to represent numbers.. It makes me very uneasy and it is genuinely unnerving to look at and I have no idea why.. What the hell causes that???  The rest unfortunately points towards dyslexia as I am almost 26 and I still can't figure out right and left and I sometimes write it on my hands when it is important, I cant separate and use b,d /q,p,g/ 5,s very well and I often interchange them, and worst of all ,I can't read unless I have a single line guide on the page because I just read all over the place with no control..   I just really need to see the Neurologist to help get this sorted.. It is really fucking my life up..
