Finally, two years later or so, I was prescribed Adderall XE and began taking it this week. I wanted to share with you all some of the differences I have noticed in case there are those still on the fence or wondering how much of a difference it makes.  &amp;nbsp;  * I'm **calmer**. No fidgeting, or bouncing my leg constantly.  * Mind is **quieter**. All the distractions and stray thoughts in my head are still there, but they are much easier to ignore. * **Zoning in** instead of **zoning out**. When I am working on something, I don't notice how much time has passed or what is going on around me. * **Organized** thoughts. I have been able to write things on Facebook and reddit that are more organized and I can say more, faster. * **Present** in conversations. When someone is talking to me, I am really listening to what they say and can hear more since I'm not trying to focus. * Decreased **appetite**. For better or worse, I have been eating about half what I usually do. I almost have to remind myself to eat during the day.  &amp;nbsp;  I know this is only the first week, and things could still change, but so far I'm really excited about the potential for this to work.  TL;DR - Adderal is having many positive effects and is so far being a big help.
