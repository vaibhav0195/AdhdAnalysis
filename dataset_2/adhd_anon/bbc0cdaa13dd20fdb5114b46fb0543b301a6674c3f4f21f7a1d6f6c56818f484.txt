bbc0cdaa13dd20fdb5114b46fb0543b301a6674c3f4f21f7a1d6f6c56818f484;;;Finally getting my shit together;;;I am a senior in high school. I also have ADHD, it was diagnosed when I was very young and have been medicating for most of my life. The last 2 years, I have struggled with my classes and grades, I had no motivation to do anything. Well at the beginning of this year,  I finally started getting on top of my work.   As of 2ish months into school, I currently have all A's and B's in my classes, most of which are AP classes. I have been on top of my studying, realizing that waiting until the last second is the worst and managing your work in small chunks makes school SO MUCH EASIER. When the new Super Smash Brothers game was on the horizon, a midnight release was announced. That following day I had a Calculus test worth 20% of my semester grade.  Against my father's judgement, I went, believing I was ready. I had a great time at the midnight release.  And guess what.  I FUCKING DESTROYED THAT TEST.  It has been a long time since I have seen my dad that happy with my grades.  I am spewing this out to tell you guys that I finally had a breakthrough, even though I thought I never would. Keep trying, you guys can do it!
