I was doing above average in school but had problems with spelling in English and my native language of Tamil.   I was wondering if in general ppl with adhd have problems with spelling?   I was never able to pay attention to the proper spelling when learning and used to just make up spelling on the go during tests. I used to dread my native language exams because of this.
