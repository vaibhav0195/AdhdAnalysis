Most people think in a mix of pictures and words, I think. For me, it's all words. It's not unusual for me to get lost in a building I should be used to navigating because I took a side door or different path. In tougher math courses or CS courses, where you're supposed to visualize how something works, it's pretty tough. Maps and diagrams? Forget about it. Can anyone else relate? If so, what are some good ways of compensating for it or helping me visualize things better?
