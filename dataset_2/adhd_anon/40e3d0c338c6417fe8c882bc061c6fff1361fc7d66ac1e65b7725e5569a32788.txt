When I was in 1st grade my teacher noticed it and called in my mom to talk about. Needless to say, my mom ripped her a new one and that diagnosis was never made. My academics was never a problem, it was always focusing. I look into people's eyes and listen to them speak but my mind is always somewhere else. I can't wake up in the morning. I've *never* been able to do this. It almost cost me my diploma when I was a senior and my mom couldn't get me up anymore. Through some luck, I managed to pass and graduate. I now have a full time job and a new apartment. This is the biggest struggle. Knowing that I could lose everything because I can't get up and I can't focus. My job requires a lot of memorization and focus. I've been doing well up until now but I feel like I'm slipping. I was late today; I can't be late again. What should I do?
