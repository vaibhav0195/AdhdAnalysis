4fff2579c5e5682d1d61f3eb230416ed9d9a75479ac66ae885f446a057a2fc48;;;anyone else committed as an inpatient to get add diagnosis?;;;So my phycolgist says its likely I have add. She talked to my primary doctor about starting me on meds, but he wants me to be an inpatient at the local crazy house for a few days... Is this typical? I mean my therapist is specialized in treating and working with add and adhd but yet he wants me to go to the hospital for a few nights. This won't work cuz I'm 27, broke and can't leave my job for days for that. Sorry I'm doing this with my phone. My question, who all gets inpatient treatment for their diagnosis?
