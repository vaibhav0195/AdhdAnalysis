Until Jury Duty...;;;For the last... 12 years or so, I've had a lot of freedom to structure my days how I like.  I couldn't remember the last time I'd been bored. My ADHD interfered with housework, but not much else.  I was clearly totally in control....  Until today, when I had jury duty. BLECH.  They put 60 of us in a hot room with 40 seats. I stood, and was the only person constantly rocking back and forth and switching feet. Then, we had to watch a really, really, boring video. But someone fainted, so then we had to watch the whole thing TWICE. IN A ROW. When once was bad enough.  ARGH!!!!!!  Luckily, from where I was standing, I had a view of a window where some workers were doing road construction, or I would have lost my mind.....  Anyway, after 2 hours of cramped and boring, the lawyers reached and agreement and we could leave without having to serve... but...  Sheesh! Apparently the reason I excel at llife is because I can avoid crowded rooms and excessive boring....
