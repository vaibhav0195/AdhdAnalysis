I've met wit ha GP today who prescribed a small 20mg dosage of Vyvanse for the first few days and then a ramp up to 30mg for the month and we will have a follow up in a few weeks to see how the medication affects me.  Only a few hours in I feel so relieved. I read the honeymoon period is temporary and I will embrace that feeling for now but I am finally able to think about *nothing*... I wonder if this is something common with Vyvanse? I am able to completely focus my thoughts, I can have clear and concise thoughts that are not obstructed by negatives thoughts or replaced by a thousands of ideas. But the fact that I am able to close my eyes and just relax and not have rushing thoughts in my head is such a relief.  I don't feel a huge improvement on my motivation, but I do feel a huge difference on my focus with just a small dosage. Just wanted to share!
