286f07d096fa1f0e05550e183cefa6b74148b3f60533ef94c8c02a61db039dcd;;;Feeling hopeless;;;I've been reading for about a week now after my GF acually got diagnosed and i noticed that 90% if not more of all symptoms for ADD coensided with me,  It's the regular story "Awesome person really smart but isn't very good at homework or getting papers in on time" forgetful of instructions always have a big "void" in my chest feeling like i forgot something a deadline or similar but no real depression.  no one ever acually caught up with it or even considered ADD and hasn't to this day, so i went and got it so that i could take a test and check if what i suspect is true, too bad for me... Wait time in sweden is around 1 year and a 2 month wait after the evaluation is done,  We only focus on young people here so if iwould have been 0-18 instead of 21 i would probably get help within a month.  I am feeling very hopeless right now i don't acually know what to do or how to feel, acually feeling really down and could use some.... acually had to stop my thought there i don't know what i could use. guess this thread is pointless, Thanks if you read it atleast  TL;DR: Too old 1 year waittime, would be nice if you read it.
