The way school is is not a one size fits all, and that's pretty obvious given how many people learn differently, not just people with ADHD. Given that so many people seem to have ADHD, why not create a new system?  For example, when I think of lectures, I think of them as the most inefficient and boring way to teach someone with ADHD, or someone who learns better visually or through doing. The professor speaks too slowly for us to focus on what they are saying, because we are thinking "WE GET IT, MOVE ON", and zone out, then miss the parts that we don't get or do not know. We may take more time to understand a topic and instead of being able to understand it, the professor continues and we get lost even more, because we focus on the frustration we feel about not understanding that last thing... the rest suddenly seems useless to know.   This is just one example, but a solution : If any of you are learning something that is on Khan Academy, youtube, or if your lectures are video recorded, I would suggest viewing the video at 1.25-1.5x the speed. It keeps things interesting. It also allows you to pause the video or rewind to allow yourself to understand.   That's just one example, and I think the most important one given that a teacher/professor talking in front of a class is what Post-Secondary Education is majorly reliant on.   I would love to start a discussion about what an educational system that focuses on people with ADHD would be like, and current tips or tricks that you can share that would change how we learn in our current system.
