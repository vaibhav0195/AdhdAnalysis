The things that others have written really just clicks, sometime the words could just as well have been mine. I live in Sweden, FYI.)  **Background**  So I'm in university now. It's been going okay I guess since childhood (everybody has their fair share of problems, right?) but now I need more "concentration over time" than I can muster. The times where I can really concentrate can't get me through all the things I need to learn. So I lag behind, missing deadlines of assignments and just barely passing on exams. I could get through and get my degree but what would I really have learned?  The school psychologist, whom I went to in search of some kind of solution, hasn't suggested anything but then again we've just had one talk. I haven't told of my thoughts on this being some form of ADHD because I'm afraid I might be taken for someone who's after the drugs in order to study better or get better grades. Well, I guess that could be what I'm after it it actually helps, but there's a much greater impact on my life because of this which I have always felt really helpless about.  I might come off as very casual/analytical about this, but I have cried and thought enough about the implications it has on my life and don't feel the need to write about it right now.  Maybe it isn't even some form of ADHD, but it seems I have a lot of problems in common with the rest of you, so maybe your methods would work in my case as well? I'm looking for help, not a label.  **Some ideas**  I was thinking, what I need is something outside of myself that can kind of pinch me when I just let go of whatever it is I'm doing. I can't really catch myself in the moment, no matter how many reminders/notes or how scheduled my day/week/month/year is. I even forget to do implement things that I've made to help me not to forget.  My mind just slips away into something entirely else and there is no thought process or decision behind it, at least that's what it feels like. Moments or hours later I would remember - *oh shit, that was what I was supposed to do again, well, better get back on track*. Another moment passes, and then I'm gone again.  I really rely on those times where I can hyperfocus, as the proper (?) term seem to be. But I can't do it often enough. Or rather, I can't choose the task I can focus on.  * I've been thinking about some form of self-medication, but it seems alcohol and weed are kind of a slippery slope, and I'm not sure I would even want to try that out. I'm way too scared of a potential downward spiral.   * Coffee doesn't effect me, except for... gas.  * Cats are like a favorite of mine and I thought for sure a cat would help. At least it's something with a "clock" and reactions of its own. There would be another consciousness in the room and that could maybe be of some help. But then again, I'm allergic to cats so that's that. Maybe a dog? I'm not sure I could take care of it properly. Maybe.  * I think whatever this thing is it has to be intelligent enough to notice when I'm zoning out. Maybe a service dog? I don't think I could get that kind of help, and even if I could, the path to get there would be long, because I heard the investigations to get a diagnose are super long (as well as waiting times).  * Some kind of audible timer would be best, and I think I've tried that in the past but found it incredibly annoying to be reminded every 5/10 minutes. Maybe I could implement it some other way?  So I guess now is the time when you call me lazy or tell me I'm not serious or maybe you give me some tip on how to go about this.
