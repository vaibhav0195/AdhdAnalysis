4fbb936dda980f15785ce0fd35cc02f48a3f791051761f65e29885e60d6dc9e3;;;Was expecting my ADHD diagnosis, didn't see the mood disorder coming though...HELP;;;After about ten years of feeling like everyone was just better than me at most things I finally went to a Dr. who could tell me. At the end he was sure I had ADHD and says he thinks I could be slightly bipolar. That hit me hard, that sounds like crazy to me. How have other people dealt with secondary diagnosis like this? I don't feel like my moods need to be "stabilized" but he's the professional...
