Or have you self-diagnosed the other stuff?  I'm certain that I have many of the other common comorbid disorders to ADHD (DSPD, SPD, OCD, RSD, dyspraxia), a past psychologist told me once that she thought I had OCD, and when I was being diagnosed the psychiatrist did ask some questions that seemed to be alluding to these disorders, but I only received the one diagnosis for ADHD, and he hasn't mentioned the others since.   I suspect that perhaps medical professionals would often recognise many comorbid disorders, but choose not to officially diagnose them and instead try to approach and treat them through the ADHD framework, as giving a person too many labels could be psychologically damaging to the patient.  I feel a bit frustrated by this though. I'd rather know the other disorders officially so I can, for example, read about the one sleep disorder, rather than becoming a mini expert on every sleep disorder known to man, just in case I'm missing something.
