We built it four months ago initially for sharing voice memos amongst our friends, but we had someone with ADHD join who said it's been great for implementing and sticking to a routine. She uses it to record prayer and messages for family members. Having people expecting to hear from her helps her keep that routine.  If you'd like to check it out, our home page is www.meltapp.com. Hopefully others find it helpful too :)
