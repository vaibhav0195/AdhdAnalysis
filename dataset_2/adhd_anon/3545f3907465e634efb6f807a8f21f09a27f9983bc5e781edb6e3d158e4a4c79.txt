I've been lurking around for a while though, and you guys are great. Today I have a consultation with my doctor. Technically, it's to evaluate me for ADHD, but I was diagnosed when I was very young. I'm 19 now, and I haven't been on meds since I was 10.   The problem is that my mother is controlling about a lot of things and she didn't want me on medication. I took Straterra and Ritalin in the past and she said it made me an emotionless zombie, so she took me off meds. I've finally gotten her to realize that my ADHD is really affecting me and at this point in my life I want to be medicated.    Last night she starts trying to tell me that she doesn't want me on stimulants because I personally have told her I don't like Albuterol, so she's now against that. She wants me to try Straterra and Ritalin again. But this is why she didn't want me on medication in the first place! I told her that what medication I'm on is between my doctor and myself. But my mother thinks that because she's a nurse,  that she knows best. How can I get her to understand that she doesn't have a pony in this race? She's now trying to get me to have her on the call when I go to the consultation. I don't want this. But I'm on her insurance and she's very good at making me feel like I'm being a "horrible daughter" if I don't do exactly what she says.   Basically, as a 19 year old college student, what do I do about my controlling mother trying to control my ADHD medication?
