It really helps with to study and chills me out in general—That is while the effects of the drug last.  Currently taking a 20mg dose, and it last for about 4 hours. When the Vyvanse wears off, I feel brain-dead, tired and anxious. (worse than if i take no meds at all). I talked to my Doc about this issue, and he told me to take another 20mg when the 1st dose wears off. This does help me, but now my sleep schedule is terrible. I'm up all night and sleep through my morning class. (even if I don't take the 2nd dose). I've done some research and see this is a common issue, amongst Vyvanse users.   How do you all get over this "crash" without taking more meds? Also, is their anything that can be done to make the initial dosage last longer? (the less drug intake—the better). Finally, does anyone have a hard time shutting off your brains internal dialogue when on the drug? (Guessing it's anxiety?... For example, if I'm studying in the library and a cute girl sits across from me and checks me out, my brain wont stop analyzing LOL. I have a girlfriend too, so the thoughts are quite unpleasant! Usually happens when I'm coming down from the Vyvanse, or else I would be too focused on my studied to even worry about anyone!)  Thank you all,  -Blame it on the ADHD
