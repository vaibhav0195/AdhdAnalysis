I called close to 10 GPs/Family Doctors in the end before I found one who would take me without a psych referal. I live in a town with two colleges, so there's a lot of drug seekers out there I guess. My GP even joked with me about how many he would see trying to score something.  I almost cried when he diagnosed me. He said he barely had me fill out the self-reporting test he uses, because after reading my chart and seeing me fidgeting and zoning out he kinda assumed it.  I spoke with him for a while and was diagnosed with ADHD-PI and was prescribed 30mg of Vyvanse.   Which, by the way, is expensive as all fuck. Retail price at Walgreens of $230, and the manufacturer coupon from Shire brought it down to about $145. Had to pay out of pocket for now due to holidays and my prescription insurance company running skeleton crews next week, and I needed to have a prior authorization.    So far it's great. I've tried Adderal XR before through my roommate and hated it. It caused ridiculous amounts of insomnia. I'd be wired for 24 hours straight. The constant buzz was nice, but it didn't really help me focus, and it was a literal 'buzz' in my head.    Vyvanse is totally different. It feels so much smoother kicking in, and it's lasting much longer than the Adderall did focus-wise, without giving me the energy of 1000 men.    For once in my life my thoughts feel normal. Fuck you pinball-machine-brain!     I just wanted to thank everyone here at /r/ADHD. I never really posted, but I've been lurking since around March.   **tl;dr** You guys are informative as shit and I love you all! :)
