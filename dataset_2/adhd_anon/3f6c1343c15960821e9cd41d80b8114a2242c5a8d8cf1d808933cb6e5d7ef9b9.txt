After a month I had a review mentioned my side effects: euphoria, couldn't sleep at night, always jiggling my foot, grinding/clenching teeth.      He said I might be sensitive so my meds changed to 2 doses a day 10mg in the morning 5mg before 12pm.       Euphoria went away, still jiggling the foot, not sleeping, grinding not clenching anymore.    So he cut my dose down to 2, 5mg each and even suggested experimenting myself with microdosing... did that now onto experimenting with microdosing and sleeping meds he prescribed. so currently 2.5mg x 2 once @ 7 once at 11pm. still can't get enough sleep. I don't want to wake in the morning I want moar sleep.      Is this going to go away or do I need to give it longer then 3 months (I have been semi consistent with taking them but I admit on some weekends I was like fuck it I need my sleep). when the meds wear off I feel Im crashing really hard. Any tips on how to get some sleep?
