My brother (21) was diagnosed a year ago with ADHD and serve depression. He is extremely intelligent, always had top marks, but broke down about this time last year over finals and had to leave Uni. Previously the family assumed he just procrastinated when he stayed up all night trying to write an essay, or was burnt out from working so hard.   Since he's been diagnosed my mother has been VERY supportive, trying to help in anyway possible; patiently trying to help with his homework, create schedules to finish work, transport him to the gym (as he doesn't drive and it helps his concentration), and everything else under the sun. She, and the rest of us simply don't know what else we can do to help, and it's horrible to watch someone you care for so much, with unlimited potential, be miserable.   He has a great psychiatrist, therapist, and recently got a life coach. His medications have certainly helped him improve, but he isn't happy or close to fully functioning. We all know he is trying his best, but at this point can't figure out what will help him. He practices a lot of avoidance strategies (ie it's time for homework and suddenly he has to eat/sleep/go to the gym) and has difficulty even going through the motions of an average day.  My question is what helped you, personally, the most through your experience? And what did your family members do to help/hurt the process?
