First we tried concerta (i don't remember the mg), then vyvanse, then adderal (this did work... For about an hour then never again), pro vigil, new vigil pretty much everything at the time. What did work didn't work very long and never worked again. From what my Dr says I metabolize the medicine to fast. Does anyone else have this problem?
