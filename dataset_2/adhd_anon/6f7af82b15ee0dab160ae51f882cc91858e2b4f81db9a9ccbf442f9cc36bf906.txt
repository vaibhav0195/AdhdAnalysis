6f7af82b15ee0dab160ae51f882cc91858e2b4f81db9a9ccbf442f9cc36bf906;;;Pointed this out today.;;;The topic of ADHD came up, and the guy said he thought it was bullshit lazy people claim. I asked him what his stance was on abortion and he said he wouldn't go into it because he didn't have a vagina. I just asked him to think about that for a bit..  Edit: I didn't expect this to go anywhere, so I suppose I should clarify more as to why it really pissed me off.  I was kicked out of university a year ago for poor academic progress. The last year I was at the university, I was getting help through the campus medical center in the form of Ritalin. That did help a lot, but I still did not have the organizational skills I needed to do well. Then after I was dropped, since I was no longer at the university, I could not get access to any medication and I did not have good experience with the doctors outside of campus, so I decided to go without. So I have spent the last year and a half now working hard to get good grades and turn myself into a better organized man at a community college. I need to get good enough grades at a lower level institution to get back into the university.  So after all this work, I am now at the end of my semester and I have at least two A's and two B's.  That isn't perfect obviously, but it was my best semester yet in 5 years of trying.  When I was at the university and first got diagnosed, I thought I may have just been lazy. This last year however, I have been eating healthier, exercising, sleeping full nights and on a regular schedule, and more importantly going to class every day and doing all the homework. All that and I still have trouble staying focused, remembering things, going too fast, etc..
