After conversing for a while one thing lead to another and we began to talk about ADHD. Being the only one there that has ADHD (as well as thinking about you guys) I began to correct their assumptions about ADHD as well as trying to give them a glimpse of what it is like having ADHD. After attempting to do this I realized, I don't really have any creative or at least a layman termed analogies to explain what having ADHD is like. So my question to you is what is your favorite analogy to use in this situation? TLDR: what is a creative analogy you like to use in order to explain ADHD to someone?
