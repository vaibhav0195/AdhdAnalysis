255b088d8f96d1b2606aa0533ec9710441f0a51f857ace352e57dd08570cc67c;;;Yesterday, I was finally diagnosed with ADHD. After 19 years of struggling on my own, I picked up some strategies to cope. Come share yours!;;;The last 24 hours has been completely overwhelming. I keep on researching more and more, and everything fits perfectly. Things I took for granted as me just being weird (hyperfocusing, for example) I can now relate to with other people! Ok. Sorry, I just cannot express the relief I now feel.   Ok, last year I took a class on "Success" (seriously) and although really strange, there is one strategy he shared that has helped me tremendously.   I plan out my days by time. Sometimes, there is only so much time I can devote to a project/ assignment. For example, here is what I wrote in my planner for yesterday:  * 10:30- Psych appointment (where I finally got diagnosed with ADHD!)  * ~11-12:15- Drop off prescription, lunch.  * 1-1:50- Class (presentation)  * 2-3:15- Finish english paper  * 3:30-4:45- Class (Turn in paper)  * 5-6:30- Home, relax. Eat. * 6:30-7:30- Study Bio chapters 24-25  * 7:30-8- Watch TV &lt;----------TIP: If you want to watch ONLY 30 mins of TV, turn it on 30 mins into the hour- most shows start on the hour, so you will only catch the last 30 mins, BUT then on the hour the program ends, giving you a chance to turn off the TV before you (I) get distracted by the next show.  * 8:30-9:30- Study more.  It goes on like that. It helps me remember to accomplish everything I need to, because I don't let myself do anything BUT what I had already planned (to an extent. Don't completely block out all spontaneity!) Also, it helps me get motivated, because once a task's time period is up, that is it. Either I'm done or it won't get completed. It's like the pressure that sets in when something is due in the next hour, only without the panic if the deadline isn't met. In those cases, I underestimated the time needed, and just "bought" myself another 12+ hours!  Edit: This also helps if you have outside forces that might derail you from finishing tasks. For example, if you get a call inviting you to dinner/ hang out. If you have previously blocked out a time to finish something, like a paper, you tell the friend that you are busy now, but at (based on the schedule above, 5 for me) you can drop by. And then at 6:30, you can leave or whatever.  Ok now go!
