Thinking of making some major changes!;;;So I was diagnosed a couple of months ago, and started on stimulant meds. My doctor warned me that many people make major changes in their lives after finally figuring out what was holding them back all those years.   Now despite always being told that I'm bright, and creative, I've ended up working as a truck driver for the last 8 years, because this is a job that I haven't gotten bored with, and one that didn't require any real organisational skills at all. But now, only a couple of months on meds, I'm finding it really boring, and I'm working towards making a change.   I've started a podcast, which might have some earning potential once it's up and going, and I've been offered a spot hosting on a pilot episode for a TV show. It's all happening quite quickly, but I'm not rushing anything.   I'd be really interested to hear from anyone else who was diagnosed later in life, who then went on to make major changes like that. What are some potential pitfalls to look out for?   TL/DR: did you make a major change in your career after being diagnosed?
