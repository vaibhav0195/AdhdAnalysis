This is usually a good thing, but sometimes I end up with people with more problems than I can handle. The worst part is that I find it stimulating at first, and being supportive is easy. The problem is that it gets to a point where I dread contact because I know that sooner or later something bad happens. And being supportive gets really hard.   The only solution I've found is to be less social, and gradually cut contact. Preferably before I dread talking to them in fear of more bad news. I feel really bad, but it ends up being toxic for me. I try to be honest, but that usually means blunt, and I'm not surprised that I come off as mean.   How is this adhd related? Well, I read somewhere that we often uncritically seek contact, and miss the warning signs. Does anyone else have similar experiences?   Tl;Dr I befriend people with more problems than I can handle, and I don't realise it until I'm waist deep.
