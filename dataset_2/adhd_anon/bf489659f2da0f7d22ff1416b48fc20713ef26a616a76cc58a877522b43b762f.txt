We spent the session talking about how anxiety could have prevented me from sticking to a job. He decided it would be best to put me on 10mg lexapro to manage what he believed was anxiety and not so much ADHD, that causing the change in professions.   Has anyone else experienced multiple job changes in different fields, is this common in ADHD or is it more linked to anxiety ?
