89cb5ac93dcb24e45886439b23ead23a711c981d45989b7f54c686cdb8c11481;;;Anyone know a guy named Thom Hartmann and his theories on ADHD?;;;So I wrote a paper about Thom Hartmann's theory on ADHD and how they we were built for a pre-agricultural state of society and how ADHD could be considered not a disorder because common ADHD symptoms could have helped a hunter in his state of society.    Thoughts??
