a19a83476ec45ef8c4f4b16d46d3d622a9dc94ba4bace8c32e1ba89782429f36;;;I am getting very frustrated with what should be easy points on my grade in college;;;I'm in college right now and I'm having a lot of problems, especially because I was just diagnosed with ADHD last summer.  I get really REALLY frustrated while doing school work, particularly homework as many classes I have use some kind of online homework system.  My frustrations come from the fact that, while I do the problem, I make some kind of mistake and when I submit the answer and the program basically goes "lols, you got it wrong. -5 points of your score," and that's it, no help nothing.  By the time I figure out my mistakes (usually on the 2nd or 3rd time) I am getting half credit for the problem and despite doing ALL of the homework, it's tanking my grade.  I get frustrated because I know homework should be an easy 30%-ish points on your overall grade and because I don't do so well on my exams I need every point I can get and it gets bad that I quit doing homework because, I'm getting basically the same grade with out the frustration and headache.  Is anyone having a similar problems and how did you fix/get around it.  TL:DR: I am getting frustrated with a homework system that seems to be tailored to be the bane of my grades
