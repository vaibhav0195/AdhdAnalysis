New to rx..;;;Quick history, diagnosed with adhd as a Leetle Child, was on Ritalin very very young and don't remember much. Had a bizarre habit of hiding my pills and not taking them. I remember an entire desk drawer full of pills that I'd hide. Dunno why I did it. Now, I'm afraid of taking medications long term.... Relying on them, seeing I just Might Be Better with them.... But anyway. I'm an artist half of the time and work in a kitchen the other half. Other chronic illness has me struggling with physical labor, leading me into wanting to go back into art. Really, I'm wondering if pills are effective on an as needed basis. I.e, ok I'm working at home today, I should work on my comic... Pill time! Is that counterintuitive? Is it most effective to do it every day at a certain time, etc?   Tldr can I medicate as needed?
