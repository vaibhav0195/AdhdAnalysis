I was diagnosed with ADHD several years ago but wasn't treating it for a while, then I went to get treated for it and my psychiatrist said I have moderate depression. He said I could take antidepressants along with adderall but I decided to try CBT instead and see if that worked. This was all last May when I got started with adderall.  I have been doing CBT since then and while I feel like that along with adderall has helped me, I still have mood swings a lot and I get easily angry and some days I still do feel depressed, but it's not as many days and I feel less self loathing generally than I used to. I still feel pretty unmotivated most of the time unless there is an urgent need to do something, and I feel negative a lot. I told all this to my psychiatrist and he again said I could take antidepressants if I wanted. I'm just not sure if I want to because my sister and one of my friends took antidepressants and had a bad experience. I'm just not sure if it could help or if it would just make things worse.  I'm looking for if anyone could share their experience with taking adderall and antidepressants, and what kind you took. I have tried to do some research on my own but it is overwhelming with the amount of antidepressants out there. I'm going to ask my therapist as well when I go see her in 2 weeks.
