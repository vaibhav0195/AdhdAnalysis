b9f0e385aa5afeed5eb2750a5b2eeb0ec70c00c282a74535e44ef3012e007299;;;Just found this sub and i'm overwhelmed;;;After 28 years i finally understand myself. I'm overwhelmed with joy for finally understanding why I am the way that i am. I've been reading some of these posts with my fiance and it's like reading about myself.   So happy find others like me...  p.s. I almost quit writing this post about 15 times
