I was diagnosed as a kid with ADHD and I stopped taking meds on my own volition around when I was in 7th grade from hearing a lot of hubbub about the medication/ probably feeling weak about it. I've had a couple more experiences trying to get back on meds. Anyway, I just wanted to say it's really nice seeing that I'm not alone in how I experience the world!
