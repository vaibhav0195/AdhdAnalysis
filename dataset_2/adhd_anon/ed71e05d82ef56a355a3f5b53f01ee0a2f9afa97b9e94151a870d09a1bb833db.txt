I am meeting my therapist for few months now.    Last one was yesterday for 2 hours and she asked me about my sexual life and how it goes with my wife. I told her that my wife and I are swingers and I was talking about my experience and encounters. I kept talking and when I looked at her she was biting her tongue and kept crossing her legs and uncrossing. I felt like she enjoyed it. All I know about her is a divorce therapist and we went out after one of our sessions to drink coffee together. She wasn't open about her life but kept giving me advices in how to handle the stress in work and school for free for the entire hour.   Is it unprofessional to play with her or it is okay?
