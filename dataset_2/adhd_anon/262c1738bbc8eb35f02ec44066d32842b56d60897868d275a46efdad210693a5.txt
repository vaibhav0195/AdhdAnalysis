I started at 18 mg and when it was adjusted accordingly to fit my needs, I was taking a total of 90 mg of concerta and 10 mg in the middle of the day to keep it going longer. I always had horrible comedowns that resulted in aggression and depression and horrible headaches.   I stopped for a couple years (because I just couldn't handle the feeling of the comedown), and in that time, basically got nothing done and goofed off. I decided I needed to take it again.   I've been taking 54 mg, and the decrease in appetite was expected, but I manage to at least eat 1200 cal a day at some point. What I need some advice on is how to reduce the effects of the comedown, I get very irritable and just all-around indifferent to anything going on around me. I get a bad headache, and somewhat blurry vision at some points. I feel like doing something but almost as quickly as I think of it, I hate the thought of doing anything. My SO that I live with doesn't like how I act when I comedown, and I try to be as positively interactive as possible, but it's a huge internal struggle for me. I don't know what to do, and any advice would be greatly appreciated.
