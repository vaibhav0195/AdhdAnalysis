I was diagnosed with ADHD-NOS when I was 17 (diagnosis made during an updated psychological evaluation for accommodations for college) I have not taken medication, but have been to therapy (for anxiety) and  I have developed good coping mechanisms and my grades are better than they've ever been, things are going well, but I have had some issues: I am studying music performance in college, and I am very frustrated that I am not able to focus as much as I would like to in ensemble rehearsals. I miscount rests because I am not paying attention and feel like I am in a constant mental "cloud" and make careless errors even when I have practiced my parts obsessively. Though I have improved immensely musically while in school and am a strong musician, I feel like I am not performing at my true potential.  As I've played in more advanced groups recently, I notice how focused musicians need to be for rehearsals-- so many strong/pro musicians have this amazing mental sharpness and focus that I can only dream of emulating and I feel like is completely hindered by my ADHD. As an aspiring professional musician, I have been considering medication recently for this purpose.  But, almost everything else in my life has been just fine and I'm coping with my symptoms well, and it feels so strange to medicate for this one (albeit very important) part of my life. I am just very frustrated, I would never want my career plans to be hindered by my symptoms.  Any thoughts/advice? I would really really appreciate it!!
