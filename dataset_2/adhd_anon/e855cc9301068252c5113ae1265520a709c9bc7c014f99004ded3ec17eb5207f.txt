I'm a 22 year old female and I seemingly match all the symptoms of ADHD-inattentive. I was often accused of daydreaming throughout childhood at school, and left many lessons with only the date written. I struggled with all homework, passed with mediocre grades, and eventually failed University. My house is a mess, the thought of housework makes me sad, and my depression and anxiety are thriving on my inability to focus.  Anyway, I'd like to be properly diagnosed, but I'm worried about getting diagnosed over here. I still have to wait two more weeks to get properly registered at the doctors, then an ungodly amount of time before I can see a specialist (from what I've read.) The potential of finally being able to organise my life and maybe eventually go back to University sounds too amazing to be true. The wait sounds extremely stressful and upsetting. I've finally been able to quantify what may have been causing all these problems throughout my life, and waiting on it for so long just sounds like torture.  Anyone from the UK with Adult ADHD had positive, or not so, experiences? Please let me know your stories. Thank you!
