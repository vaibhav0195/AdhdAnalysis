647cbedcfe0dc6df0d3317392f2caa1513484489cf7cc7154be564e451199d75;;;Am I the only person who get's obsessed over new friends?;;;I have attributed this to my ADHD, but I am curious if anyone else experiences this.   When I meet a new friend or romantic interest that I **really like**, I get obsessed with them. Not in a controlling or stalker way. I just really wanted to hang out with them, talk to them, text them, all the time. Between the ages of 12-15, this severely affected a lot of my relationships with people. We would like each other the same amount at first, but eventually I would spook them off with my abnormal amount of interest.   This does not happen with everyone or even most people I become friends with. Just people who I admire and get along with really well. Maybe 1/20 people I get to know. And 1/10 people I consider 'friends'.   I did become good friends with my best friend, who I met in middle school. I was obsessed with her, but she was equally obsessed with me, so it worked out great. These are the relationships that work for me... with other people that get almost as obsessed with me. We just end up hanging out **all the time**. We are still best friends today.   This was almost always bad with potential boyfriends, because (as I learned overtime) guys like to chase girls when they first meet them. If you just throw yourself at them, they lose interest pretty quick! Even if we could have had a good relationship otherwise. This is why I failed to have a boyfriend until my senior year (I figured out the problem when I was 15, but it took my 2 more years to get it under control). When I found a boyfriend who was equally obsessed with me and I felt like I didn't have to hide it, I was really happy. We have been together for three years.   It's still not really under control. If I really like someone, I have to constantly keep myself from doing too much. I try to hide it. I tally how often they text me first and try to not text them first 50% of the time. I try to wait 5-10 minutes to reply to their texts. I worry about every little thing I do and try to not come off as stalker-ish. But I can usually only remain good friends with people that like to hang out with me often - if people never text me first or never want to come over when I invite them, it hurts my feelings.   It makes me feel annoying and vulnerable. I don't like that, so even if I really like the person I start to avoid them. Even though most of the time it isn't because they don't like me, it's just because they like to be alone. I get that but it still makes me feel anxious and shitty.   Lone wolves and me just don't get along :/
