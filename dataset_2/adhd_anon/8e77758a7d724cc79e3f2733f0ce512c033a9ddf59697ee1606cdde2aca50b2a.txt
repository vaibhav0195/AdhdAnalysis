Thoughts and opinions highly appreciated.;;;On ADHD  I don't know what induced me to start looking up all these stories about adhd. I've known many people diagnosed with it but always believed it wasn't a real phenomenon. I thought to myself, "Everyone is like that though. Hell, I'M like that." But my grades are great. It can't be. Yet school has always been difficult. Getting these good grades isn't what I'd call "simple." I put a TON of effort into getting them. My friends often mention how I always seem to "put so much more effort" into my work than them. How I am the "perfect student" because I study so often. But am I really? I feel I have to work twice as hard than anyone else to simply "remember" things I learn in class. I have to start my projects and homework assignments weeks in advance because I feel like I may actually take THAT long.   But here I am, senior at my university. Still as anxious over this work as ever. I go back on my antidepressants because I have a panic attack. (I was diagnosed with anxiety &amp; depression my 2nd year here.) No depression this time around so I can't blame my lack of motivation on that. Must be senioritis, I think to myself. But goddamn, why is it so hard to do anything? I can't even do things I supposedly enjoy like watching shows; I tend to end up taking out my 3DS and play it at the same time. Maybe it's because I'm bored, I think. So many unfinished things tasks. But then I find myself remembering back to the 3rd grade. I remember spacing out often. Failing tests. I almost got held back that year because my teacher claimed I couldn't spell basic words. Mother argued I was a bad test-taker. I still am. I do horribly on long tests? But why? I can't focus long enough. Possibility of adhd? Or am I blowing this all out of porportion?
