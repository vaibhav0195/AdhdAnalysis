Time to move forward.;;;So i decided to get tested for ADHD about a month ago as i was struggling in school and in general life itself. I set up an appointment for the psychiatrist and kicked things off. In his opinion from talking to me and watching me he agreed that it was a high probability that i had ADHD. He referred me to a psychologist for additional testing.   After meeting with my psychologist we decided that four hours of testing is the path we would take. The first test would be an IQ test and the second was what he called and achievement test. I ended up doing two, two hour, segments.  Today we met and i got the results of said tests. I cant says im too shocked by the ADHD part, although it was different then i originally thought. Ill list everything out below and try to get things right or as close to how he explained.  **IQ RESULTS**  * FSIQ = 116(High end of high average)- This was actually quite a shock.  **ACHIEVEMENT RESULTS**  * Reading-106  * Writing-105  * Mathematics-92(May be considered a learning disability but might not)  There was a lot of numbers thrown at me so i probably missed a lot to add into this.  He official diagnosis was that i have a severe ADHD-Pi issue. He through some numbers at me like 12.66 and then 6 and said something about being over double. I wish i would have gotten more info but maybe some of you amazing folks here could help me understand more as i only had an hour with him.  We meet again on Wednesday to discuss medication and schooling an all of that.

Recently i found a passion i love though i am not good at it yet, which is sketching/drawing/lettering/design. I absolutely LOVE doing these and when i start i feel great but EVERY time i start i lose interest within 20 minutes of struggling to get started. I am still in the process of figuring out my medications with the doctor as my 10mg ritalin twice daily does absolutely nothing for me. Well the other day i did a BIG no no, and took more than what the doctor prescibed and i felt great i was focused and able to function and do my first small lettering project. But i definately will only do it once to since i am only precribed 10mg twice daily.  Anyway so what can i do that may help me out with this? I get so frustrated when i have all of these great ideas flowing but my mind wont allow me to get them out and has me thinking and doing about 15 other things at once.  My first two major projects i want to do are a lettering/drawing memorial for my dog who recently had to be put down, and a smaller lettering/sketch/drawing that will turn into a tattoo when i am finish. The second one is for my son so its definately a tattoo i cant regret.   Anyway what has help other creative types here focus and get shit done.
