I don't want to throw around any possible diagnostic ideas of what it might be, but does anyone else deal with this?  &amp;nbsp;  For as long as I can remember, I often make the mistake of writing the second letter of a word before linearly writing the entire word first.   &amp;nbsp;  - For example, as I was studying for an exam today, I *needed* to write "ICVS" for Int'l Crime Victim Survey. Instead of writing I-C-V-S, I wrote C (then put the "I" before the C) and V-S.  - When intending to write the word "Academics" and I forgot the last "C" and had to fit it in after originally writing "Academis."  - When intending to write the word "reduced," I wrote "R-D..." Then stopped and had to change the "D" into looking like an "E."   &amp;nbsp;  Typing tends to be less of a problem, but handwriting is painstakingly irritating and frustrating. I am regarded as "bright" and "smart," so these mistakes aren't a product of grammatical errors / lack of knowledge.  &amp;nbsp;  I am currently on Concerta as of a month and I think I am just more aware of this habit because I am able to focus for a long duration of time and notice more details and errors I used to bypass.
