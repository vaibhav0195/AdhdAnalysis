I was diagnosed with ADHD 15 years ago, my mother thought it was a "fad" refused to medicate. She pulled me out of therapy and that was that. I completely fuck up school and life, despite being pretty sharp. I got into a HS with a 3% acceptance rate, I just could not deal with the pressures. I assume it's ADHD related, it fits the textbook definition.   I have taken Adderall and I have it available to me when I need it. I would say I take it 3-5x a month, depending on my school &amp; work work load. When I have to get my shit together and focus, it helps immensely. I feel like I'd like to try a lower dose on a daily basis and see how well that helps me in my day-to-day.   Should I even mention this to my therapist? I hate the idea of hiding it from them, but I also want to say "Hey, this works in high doses, can we try it in a different way?" Obviously they can't prescribe, but my regular doctor can and will on a recommendation. I am not a "Seeker" by any means. I can afford to buy as much as I need on a regular basis if I really want to. I would just prefer to be upfront about wanting to be monitored by a doctor and have things be legit.   Sorry if this is asked a lot, I haven't found a similar post
