A little over a month ago I was formally diagnosed with ADHD-PI and put on Vyvanse 30mg (though I was recently bumped up to 40mg and today is my first day on it).  I’ve always been really interested in cars ever since I was little. And I really want to start a project car, I have since I was 9, but my parents don’t even want me to have a car until I’m 21, which is when he bought my sister her car. I also think that you should know how to fix up a car; it’s a really valuable skill.  I mean, right now, I don’t even have my license, not until November, but I really want to fix up a car this summer or the next. I don’t even like driving when I’m not on my meds, it makes me feel uneasy because I know the statistics for teens with ADHD.  My ADHD, like most other people with it, has caused me to lose interest in hobbies and activities really quickly and jump all over the board. My parents always bring up my past hobbies and use this against me whenever I say I want to start something new, no matter how much I really like it.  I mean, they put me in dance programs and sports when I was little, but I never chose them myself, so I never liked doing them. And then my dad forced me into golf, which I hated so much and only played for a season.  Now, when I’m on my medicine, I can really focus and do the stuff I want and be a normal person.   I also want to pay for the car all by myself.  I have a summer job and I make decent money. How do I get them to forget the past and look at the person I am now and let me do this?  Any advice would be helpful. Thanks. And sorry if this was the most disjointed thing you’ve ever read.
