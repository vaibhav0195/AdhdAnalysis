A few days ago I went to my normal family doctor for an ADHD diagnosis. I've been convinced I've had it for awhile... don't want to go into details, but pretty damn sure. Anyway, he reffered me to specialist group for evaluation. They have sent me new patient paper work to fill out, and I'm interested in some of the questions on the paper work.  There seem to be a lot of substance-abuse related questions, such as "Have you ever used or experimented with drugs or smoked marijuana?", and questions about how frequently I drink and stuff. The truth is, I've had a "problem" with alochol... and I've tried pretty much every drug there is (marijuanna, cocaine, meth, mdma, shrooms, list goes on...).   If I answer honestly on these questions, will that effect what treatment options are available to me? For instance, if I listed cocaine or meth and something I've done before, will that keep them from prescribing me a stimulant medication (something I'm interested in trying)? Or if I indicate I've had substance abuse problems in the past?  I'm not going to treatment to "fish" for meds for recreational use or anything of that nature... but I would like to try the commonly prescribed Adderal or perhaps Riddlin. I'm afraid if I list certain things in the paper work that they won't let me try it. I'm convinced the medication will help me because I actually have co-workers and friends who are prescribed it who say it worked wonders for their life.  tl;dr: Will a history of substance abuse / alcoholism keep me from getting prescribed stimulant medication?  Thanks for reading
