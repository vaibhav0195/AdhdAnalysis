I was diagnosed with ADHD as a teen but never wanted medication. I recently started an MA and it's been giving me a lot of problems so I decided to pursue medication.   Firstly, my doctor wanted a new diagnosis since mine was over 10 years old. That was completely understandable, but now I've been waiting to see her for about 3 weeks and they just cancelled my appointment because she's going on some sort of leave until the end of January.  I know it's not the end of the world; I've been dealing with no medication for years now. It's just gotten to a point where I'm so frustrated with my ADHD that I'm willing to try meds, but being told I have to wait till the end of January.   Have any of you gone through something similar? Got any advice?
