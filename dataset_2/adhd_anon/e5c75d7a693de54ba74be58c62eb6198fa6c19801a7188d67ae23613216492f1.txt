e5c75d7a693de54ba74be58c62eb6198fa6c19801a7188d67ae23613216492f1;;;I just took my first pill of Vyvanse today,  what can I expect in the coming days?;;;I took my first dose of Vyanse 70mg today.  I was diagnosed last week.  Today,  energetic yet relaxed,  I feel like I want to do things but I am not anxious if I don't.  I have dry mouth and I still am getting distracted but I don't have the resistance to the tasks that used to take so much wasted energy. I feel like this: http://www.roswellpaintingcontractor.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/man_relieved1.jpg_opt1.jpg  I have another appointment with my doctor in a week,  but util then:  So,  in the next few days what should I look for to make sure I'm taking the right dose?  I still am getting distracted a lot,  does that improve over the long term? What happens if i decide to not take them this weekend?  Any warning signs I should look for?  Also, how long does the effects last in the day?  Thank you for any advice or experiences you share.
