What would you suggest I do?;;;My spouse is currently taking adderall and I have asked him to speak to his doctor about antidepressants as well.  He shows signs of depression, not suicide, but general bleakness, energy issues, satisfaction issues, etc.  I am depressed and have been on meds since I was 16, so I feel like my amateur diagnosis is not crazy.  He also has had a history of depression as well.  His opinion of trying antidepressants is "too expensive, they take too long to work, I'm not depressed - it's stress"  These are all BS responses.  I think he just doesn't want do it and revel in his depression - which is something depressed people do.    Is there another way I might address this issue with him, besides being upfront?  I've also tried ignoring it, being supportive, being kind and trying to have enough optimism for our family.  He is stressed out for sure, being a returning student at a very difficult school, but he needs more help than adderall and monsters and I can provide.    For those who take antidepressants and ADHD meds, how do you think they have helped you, if at all?  He reads this subreddit alot, so I hope he sees this, and the community members responses.  Thanks   TL;DR ADHD spouse probably needs antidepressants as well, but refuses to consider the ides based on non-science reasons.
