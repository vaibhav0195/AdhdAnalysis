Looking back at those frustrating 4 years of barely passing any exams, with extreme periods of procrastination and an inability of sitting down and learning or listening to theoretical stuff without losing track of my thoughts and some minor details catching my attention, carrying my thoughts away.  I was suffering from depression, because I just couldn't get anything done and I was lacking any experience of success. ADD was considered, I got Ritalin prescribed, but it didn't help, despite trying all kinds of doses.  It was this summer when I figured that I might just be doing the wrong thing. I haven't been super excited about studying in first place, it was just the more obvious alternative to flight school, and since all my friends were about to go to college, I did so as well.  So now I'm about to drop out of college, and I don't mind, but looking back at those years I am wondering whether I am just not the type of person made for studying (since it seems like not everyone is made for studying, otherwise everyone would do it, right?) or whether there was/is some ADD condition going on in my head.  I think it's very hard to draw the line here, between personality traits and an actual ADD condition. The thing is, I definitely **can** focus if I am really motivated to do so and if I'm really interested in something. I've passed the first qualification exams for flight school, measuring my reaction time and my attention span, and the results were above average, so I think this speaks for itself. I am really happy about that, and it was important to me to share my thoughts here.  Still, I think it is definitely something to consider when people start diagnosing themselves with AD(H)D. Maybe some of them are just doing the wrong thing, I don't know...  **TL;DR:** Quitting college becaue my performance was miserable. Now about to go flight school with a good outlook. Therefore wondering whether severe focussing issues can be caused by a lack of interest  and/or certain personality traits as well (in some cases) and are misdiagnosed as ADD.
