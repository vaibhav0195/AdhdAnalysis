I recently started on Wellbutrin (actually the generic version) after recently being diagnosed with ADHD. The reason I chose it was because I wanted to us a non-stimulant medication, and it was the least costly. If it matters, I used to be taking Paxil for depression.   I would like to know what others experience with using Wellbutrin were. Anyone else use it?   Thanks.   Edit: Thanks for the replies. I plan on staying on Wellbutrin, as my doc recommends for now and just track my progress. If I don't see any difference then I may try Straterra.
