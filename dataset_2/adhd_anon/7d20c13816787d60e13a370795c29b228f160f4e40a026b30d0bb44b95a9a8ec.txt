Just to preface, I am a 17 years old male, have AD/HD Primarily inattentive, and also have some social anxiety. I am being treated and taking Adderall 20mg.   So the other day my girlfriend and I went to a Wal-mart by my house to buy condoms. Naturally, because of our age, I wanted to keep this on the D-low and not run into anyone we knew. I must have been on autopilot and not have realized what we were actually doing until we were in the isle, if that makes sense. Basically, all of the social anxiety hit me at once. I suddenly felt like I needed to get away from her and into another isle right away.  She understood and we met up at another section. I hurried her through the self checkout and all of this time I just really wanted to leave. We got back into my car and I find it hard to describe how I was feeling. I felt out of it and disconnected but I also felt nauseous and irritated. I really wanted to just be held and comforted. I hadn't eaten in a while so I though with some food I would feel better. I made a sandwich and we went upstairs where I proceeded to bawl my eyes out while she held me.   After around five minutes of this I felt a lot better and just suddenly stopped crying. It was like I had woken up. I've never felt anything like that whole experience before and it was quite confusing and unpleasant. I didn't really experience any of the physical symptoms like heart rate and such.  So my questions are as follows  * Do you think that was a panic attack or was it something else?  * Does the medicine have anything to do with it?  *  Are these a side effect of AD/HD just in general?  Thanks for reading =)  TL;DR- Went to buy condoms, had possible panic attack, or did I?
