I'm new here, but that many of you might benefit from a tool that I built to make insurance comparison shopping easier. It allows you to input the name of a medication to see how each insurance provider covers it.   **[RxCompare](http://rxcompare.pill-fill.com)**  If you're looking for new insurance to cover your ADHD medications, I think this might be helpful. I built it after getting frustrated trying make sense of dozens of 100+ page formularies myself.  The tool focuses primarily on states without their own healthcare exchange, so not everything is covered. There's also no advertising, sponsorships, or dirty revenue model- it's just a tech experiment I did to see if we could make finding an insurance that covers your medications easier than it currently is. Let me know if you have any suggestions on how to make this more useful!
