I have just turned 18 and live in a 3rd world country where I cannot go to see a psychiatrist or counsellor on my own. This is mostly because I don't have the money to go alone and i cant let my family find out if I have a problem yet this problem is seriously deteriorating everything I try to do. I have been affected by a severe lack of attention for as long as I remember and it was always attributed to my lack of trying.   I have tried several screening tests online and they all told me that though I do not have hyperactivity problems that I show the symptoms of severe Attention deficiency. Yet they all say the same things. These are not a diagnosis.  If there are any online resources I can consult to make something closer to a diagnosis, please link me to them.
