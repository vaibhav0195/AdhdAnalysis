5892c3054276cd2d21b012801d47366b2c438668f0d59213c2bc44c153308753;;;Back on the Ritz after a 5 year hiatus;;;So i stopped taking my meds when i was 16, because I was waaay too cool to let pills tell me how to live my life...fast forward through five years of short lived jobs and generally just bumbling through life..  So i went to the doc for depression, he gave me some sertraline, and we mutually agreed some kind of ADHD Med would be beneficial. So back to the original dosage of 2x 20mg SR ritalin/day.  Man I forgot how much energy they give you! I went to the gym while on them, most brutal workout I've done ever.   Sadly I forgot about the side effects, like mild headaches, stomach pains, insomnia (if taken late in the day)  These Ritz are either gonna make or break me.   &gt;is there any changes I can make to my diet to subdue the nausea? Current average days meals are:  &gt;Breakfast: 4 weetbix milk and brown sugar  &gt;Lunch: 2x mandarin, 1x banana, 1x nut bar, 1x apple 1x chicken cup-a-soup &gt;Dinner: potatoes, steak, peas, bread.  I'm also 99% sure I suffer from social anxiety and what can I do about that?    TLDR: Ritz make me an animal in the gym, but make me want to throw up a well.
