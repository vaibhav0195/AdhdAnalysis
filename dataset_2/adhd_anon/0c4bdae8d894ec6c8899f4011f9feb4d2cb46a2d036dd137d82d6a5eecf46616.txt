I called the doctors office so I can get my vyvanse recipe (was delaying to go for it for a week) . The thing is that today is friday and Ive got work to do today and a party tomorrow. I woke up like shit but I knew that if I didnt go I would fuck up my work and be a wreck at the party. I had to be there before 5pm or the only way was to get it on monday and that was not an option. So I just pushed through and got it (funny how in the end it is so easy). My point here is that we gotta do stuff like this even if it seems the worst sometimes. As a person with adhd I know the struggle to see how a decision can affect the future but just go do it for yourself because you know you deserve it
