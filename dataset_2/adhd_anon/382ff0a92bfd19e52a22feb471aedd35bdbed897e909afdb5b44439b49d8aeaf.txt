382ff0a92bfd19e52a22feb471aedd35bdbed897e909afdb5b44439b49d8aeaf;;;Online courses - advice?;;;Newly diagnosed as ADHD-PI.  My job has a focus on continuing education, which is awesome and guaranteed to keep me interested.  However, a lot of the courses are self-directed and online.  Plus, I'm signing up for a part-time certification in creative writing, which is only offered online, as an attempt to recover from the emotional disaster that was my Masters program (I've had writer's block for three years).  Any hints on how to best succeed at these?
