She didn't give an official diagnosis to me or my mom, and brushed on the idea of medication, but said that continued therapy would be very effective. This was very frustrating for me, because it seemed like she wanted us to come back to pay for more sessions before she explained exactly what was going on. I told this to my parents, but they said that we should go with what she said. Therapy was ineffective, she tried very basic talking/coping techniques that might have been effective with me 10 years ago. I explained that medication would be more effective at this point, but they were hesitant to believe me. I am going back to see the therapist weekly now. Any suggestions?
