Myself is no exception.    That said, I have 4-5 close friends, unfortunately they live far away. In 12 years at a new place my only friendship is through the misses and acquaintances here and there, at work etc... But these 4-5 close friends, two of them have been diagnose with AHDH, and the others are in the progress and strongly suspect they have ADHD, all of us PI btw.  My theory is that people with ADHD more often than not will find their best friends with other ADHDs. Its kind of logical, the things "normal" people find weird and annoying about us, other with ADHD see as normal and familiar.

As dopamine is an excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter, which direction it takes depends on the dopamine receptor. According to the website Integrative Psychology, low dopamine levels can cause a host of challenges, as can high dopamine levels. Low dopamine may contribute to depression and poor concentration, where high dopamine can lead to excitability and agitation. There is a reciprocal relationship between sleep and dopamine in that at the same time that dopamine can encourage or prohibit sleep, sleeplessness can increase levels of dopamine."  The last part explain a lot why we function and work so much better at nighttime.   The thing that also hit me was: This means that what we do and the level of interest we have of it, will greatly affect how awake/sleepy we feel. And also, ironically that more/enough sleep will actually make this worse in many ways.  If we don't do something that makes the brain naturally produce dopamine, a good night sleep is your worst enemy.  That would also explain why i get so freaking tired if I dont take my Vyvanse when im supposed to (early enough). And also why I was so tired on too low doses of Ritalin in the beginning. Not to talk about the "rebounce effect" when the medication wear off.
