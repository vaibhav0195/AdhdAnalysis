I'll be going in, being tested, then having an MRI scan on my brain, which I then have to go back after a few weeks for another one to see how any treatment may have affected me (I assume the follow on is IF i'm diagnosed and medicated)  Since i'm in the UK where even my GP said the attitude towards ADHD, especially in adults is really poor, i'm relatively surprised about being asked to do the study since I might not even have ADHD, I was just basically wondering if anyone has had this experience before.
