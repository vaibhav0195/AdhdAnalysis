I'll exercise.;;;I trained for half marathons before I was diagnosed/medicated, and my ADD was waaaaay better than it is now (sedentary and medicated on high doses). I denied that connection forever because I couldn't (still can't) motivate myself to just start over. I'm exhausted constantly and keep telling myself I don't have the energy to run.  Well, I'm finally going to do it. I miss the energy I had when I was training and I'm not going to let myself be convinced by my excuses any longer.   Tomorrow, I'm going to get my ass out of bed (boyfriend has agreed to kick me out if I ignore my alarm) and hit the pavement.   I'll update you guys in a week or so. Please wish me luck...I'm going to need it.
