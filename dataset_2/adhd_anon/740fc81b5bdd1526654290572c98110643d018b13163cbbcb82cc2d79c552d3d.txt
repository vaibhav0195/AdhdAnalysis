I'm 24, going to graduate university (undergrad) this summer and my first meeting with a counsellor might be starting in a week or two.  I've read the FAQ about symptoms and I'm pretty sure that I fall into the ADHD-PI, Predominantly Inattentive category since I have experienced seven of them for more than five years at least. I know this doesn't mean I definitely have ADHD but I honestly need help.   The reason why I never think I have a problem is that I've always been told by my parents and myself that I'm lazy and not hard-working enough. And the reason why I'm trying to get help now is that I had a breakdown a month ago and got diagnosed with anxiety and slightly depressed. I'm also on sertraline atm. The GP suggested me to make a visit to the counselling service which, after having a triage meeting, asks me to make a support appointment (no idea what it means though).  I have also read [this thread from the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/17kgly/im_getting_tested_tomorrow_and_im_scared/) and I cried because the poster described 99.5% of my experience (except the "unable to sit still" bit because I usually zone out when I'm supposed to i.e. queue upðŸ˜‚)  I'm expecting to graduate with a 3rd honour degree and I believe if I have gotten help three years ago, I would've gotten at least a 2:1. This is because I always end up getting around 65-70 for some elements in my essays which are not even 65% completed. If I was able to "get my shit together and focus".... *sigh*  I'm scared because, as that thread OP stated, what if I don't have ADHD? What if I've been freaking lazy the entire time? What if I couldn't get into the masters program I intend to do? What if I have to move away to go to a less prestigious university because I couldn't get my shit together?? I can't waste another year before doing a masters degree. If I couldn't get through university, what else am I capable of doing in the future???  I'm not scared of being labelled because if I can get the help I need, who cares. I just want to show my knowledge, passion and skills without being hindered by... idk... myself.  It's funny to think back now because I'm aware that I'm forgetful and careless. So I actively remind myself to take notes of things I need to remember. It works out for trivial things and probably since I've been able to get away with small problems, I didn't feel the need to get extra help.  **tl;dr**  * Meet seven criteria of ADHD Predominantly Inattentive for at least 5 years  * Graduating with a poor degree in a few months.  * GP suggests me to go to the counselling service after I'm diagnosed with anxiety and mild depression. * Counselling service asks me to give them a ring to book for a support appointment * Probably fail to get into the masters programme I'd like to do * Worried, scared, feeling guilty and hopeless   **Question** English is not my first language so I'm worried that when I'm with the counsellor face-to-face, I'd miss out things I need to tell him/her. Since this post is a good representation of my experience and problems, is it a good idea to edit it a little, add my specific symptoms then show it to the counsellor?   ^^^^Dear ^^^^bot, ^^^^please ^^^^don't ^^^^remove ^^^^my ^^^^post ^^^^;-(
