I've recently just started on the process to test if I have ADHD, after being on anti-depressants for a few months. It's been very stressful for me, because one day my brain feels like it's zinging around and I spend a lot of time just pacing and thinking when I should be doing plenty of other things, then the next day I just slump down to where I feel like I'm having no thoughts at all, and fall into a depressive habit of telling myself that I'm just looking for an excuse for all my past failures.  Here's my question. For those of you that have been diagnosed with ADHD, how do you feel like your brain thinks and make decisions? That is, do you always have a racing internal monologue going, or do you sometimes feel like you're just in a daze making decisions and living an unorganized life sometimes without a single word being thought out?   I've been obsessively looking through the books "Driven to Distraction" and "Delivered from distraction", and each time I look I'm either entirely convinced I have it, or I beat the shit of myself for looking for an easy answer, when the reality is that I'm just a failure that isn't trying hard enough.  ****TL;DR****  **Do you always have an internal monologue that's zipping around, or do your thoughts sometimes just disappear, and you drift to unproductivity subconsciously?**
