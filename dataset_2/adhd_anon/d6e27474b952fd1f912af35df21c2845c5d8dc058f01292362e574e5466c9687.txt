d6e27474b952fd1f912af35df21c2845c5d8dc058f01292362e574e5466c9687;;;My Situation;;;So I have a couple of things. Since I can remember, I have been having problems paying attention, fighting, a good amount of stuff. Recently(15) I went to a neurologist and got diagnosed with ADHD and Anxiety. I also have been diagnosed with the iron deficiency anemia. I have every symptom. I believe I am also depressed. Never diagnosed because I would never admit to suicidal thoughts or any of that. I'm the person who just keeps everything inside and doesn't like talking to therapists.  Everything above is untreated. No medication, no visits, no treatment whatsoever. I feel like I need treatment though. It's not really that I'm depressed, it's more I'm annoyed to the point where I want to kill myself. I would say I'm not afraid to die. A symptom that annoys me the most is the lack of attention in class. I can be taking notes, and then just zone out and miss a section. I also get extreme shivers from anxiety. It's usually in public when I'm not anxious at all. Like waiting on the bus for school. I'm not cold, but it's just so annoying.   Well, I'm just looking for some advice. I'm expecting go talk to your parents, etc. Just some input to help me. Sorry for the grammar or rambling, I guess I zoned out during English class.
