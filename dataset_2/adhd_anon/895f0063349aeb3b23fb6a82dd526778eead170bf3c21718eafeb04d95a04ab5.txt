I'm pretty sure that many of us caught That moment, when we forget what we've just read, or just actively listened in e.g lecture and could'y repeat what we've heard. That is especially prevalent for adhd, having let's call it - low memory mode.  &amp;nbsp;  So i've started experimenting with repeating everything that i read, or i hear in the lecture in my own mind - it's in a way hearing myself saying those words again, in my mind, that were said by the lecturer.    Now with reading it's difficult to say, but personally uninteresting or more difficult to comprehend topics i could digest easier.  &amp;nbsp;   As for myself, i'm not sure why it works, but it ties with having a boost for short term memory, and then being able to actually digest and encode the information.   I've seen mention of simillar effects in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baddeley%27s_model_of_working_memory#Phonological_loop The model explaining that short-term memory and auditory processing are tied together, would love to hear any comments from those that know way more about it than me ^^    &amp;nbsp;  Easy way to test it, is to listen to a podcast just normally, and then listening by repeating everything you've heard (pause if you need to). And then try to remember what you've heard in section you did actively repeat, and the one you didn't and compare :P  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  It's only my personal experience, and would love to hear any similar experiences out of others.  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  TL:DR Repeating in your mind that, what you've just read, or what you've heard in say: lectures, may help you to comprehend the information, given that we have a low-memory mode, and we can't contain too much in it.
