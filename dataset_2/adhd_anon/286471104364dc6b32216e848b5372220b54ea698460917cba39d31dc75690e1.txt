286471104364dc6b32216e848b5372220b54ea698460917cba39d31dc75690e1;;;I think I might have ADD. How do I bring this up to my doctor?;;;I have had increasing issues since I was in highschool, but back then everyone just told me " it's all in your head. you are just being lazy. get over yourself".  My 8 yr old was recently diagnosed ADHD and started meds and is doing much better.  During the course of talking with his doctor, I have come to realize that a lot of his symptoms are similar to what I have experienced my whole life.  My question is, how do I bring this up to my doctor? I am on meds for depression and at first they helped, but as the weeks go on i find them  working less and less. I am so frustrated because I am at a point in my life where I feel I should be able to function in a way that I can not. My best friend just brushes it off as stress, which I do have a lot of, but I think it is more. I am afraid that my doctor will do the same thing and that if he brushes it off that I might not have the courage to go to someone else and present this.  Any help on how to bring this up to my doctor would be appreciated!
