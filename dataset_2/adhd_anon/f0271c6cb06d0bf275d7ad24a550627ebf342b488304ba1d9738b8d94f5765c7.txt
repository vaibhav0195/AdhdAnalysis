I had it pretty bad and am thankful my parents got me help. I stopped getting treatment sometime after college.  I have been considering finding treatment again because I still struggle and have issues in my social life. I feel like I blurt out stupid things sometimes and can't follow conversations as well as I like and this causes me a lot of anxiety. I interrupt people and it's awful. It's weird but work is the only time I don't feel burdened. I'm able to focus cause I have to. It's my personal and social life that is a mess. I'm always disorganized and messy and find it hard to keep track of things.  My question is how hard do you think it would be to get treatment again? I have Kaiser so I don't know if anyone has used them before either.
