A few months ago, I was diagnosed with ADHD (predominantly inattentive type) by my psychologist. It was a long and frustrating journey and so far it continues to be, and I'm looking for some guidance from the wise redditors at /r/adhd. But I guess now would be a good time for some background information  I had never had any true ADHD symptoms as a young child, and it wasn't until I was in the 7th or 8th grade that I began to notice a change; ie:  * a drop in grades * dramatic decrease in my ability to focus * overall disinterest in school or other menial tasks and things I wasn't necessarily interested in  At first, my parents and I both attributed this to growing physically and undergoing normal hormonal changes that effected my mentality.  By freshman year, my inability to focus had grown worse, and my grades kept slipping. I realized there was something abnormal occurring in my brain. I had seemingly lost my ability to hold my emotions, and i couldn't maintain the feelings I would have for the girls I'd have crushes on, I couldn't keep my mind from drifting during class or an important lecture, and most frustrating of all, I wasn't able to concentrate or focus long enough to be able to express myself creatively through music or art, something incredibly crucial to my personality. All these issues lead me into a pretty dark spout of depression, and I didn't know what to do. Eventually, I gathered myself up enough to visit my school psychologist, and she tested me for a variety of mental disorders. Her results concluded that I had depression, a generalized anxiety disorder, and ADHD.   Skip forward a few months and several therapy sessions and a formal diagnosis of ADHD from my independent psych, and I found myself with a prescription of 20mg Vyvanse. This prescription raised a lot of questions with my family, with my mother maintaining the opinion that I didn't really need the meds and that I just wasn't trying hard enough. This view about my current state from my mom was pretty crippling, and I continued to dip into depression. There where a lot of underlying emotional issues going on inside my head at this time, but I'll spare you guys that info and save it for my shrink in order to shorten this story.   But now, what I had been waiting months and months of frustration for was finally obtained. I had a prescription, a panacea, a cure-all, I would be able to focus! And write music again!  And with great excitement I took my first Vyvanse...  And nothing happened. And then i took them for the week, and still nothing. Then I started taking 30mg, for a whole month andddd **nothing**. This was a horrifying realization, and I think a valuable lesson to be told to other people beginning with their first ADHD meds, because whatever expectations I had, were not met.  So my doctor switched me to Metadate CD, claiming that I just may not be effected by amphetamine based meds. This angered me, because I believed that just increasing my dosage would begin to work, but now i would have to start over with a tiny 10mg.   And this is practically where I am now. I took 10mg everyday for the first week, and I noticed a slight difference, and now I take 20mg every day and it's increased a bit more. But I'm still very frustrated by this process. This is not what I expected, but I'm not sure what I was expecting to begin with. I guess the biggest question I could ask my fellow redditors is: **What is normal supposed to feel like?** I'm not sure what I'm looking for these medications to do or how they should make me feel. I need /r/adhd's help because you guys know what it feels like and how treatment should work because you all share this disorder, unlike my doctor. I guess thats where I have to start.   Thanks for reading this and hopefully you have something to say that could help me get through this shitty situation! If you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them. Thanks guys!
