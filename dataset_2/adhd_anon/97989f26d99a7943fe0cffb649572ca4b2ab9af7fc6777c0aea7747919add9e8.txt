One multiple occasions during the day, and especially at night, my internal 'voice' seems to change. Not just a little... I'm talking about drastically! From simple accent changes to reciting phrases in broken foreign languages. Sometimes it's musical rhythms, notes, or just plain collections of noises. I could maybe describe it like a radio tuned to the most worst possible station.   But that's not all. It loops.... Endlessly. I'm trying to figure out if that's just my brains way of figuring things out, if it's going through the garbage of the days  experiences trying to grab onto something important from them. I wouldn't think much of it I suppose, but it can stop me dead in my tracks no matter what I'm trying to do, especially trying to fall asleep.   Thoughts? Insights?
