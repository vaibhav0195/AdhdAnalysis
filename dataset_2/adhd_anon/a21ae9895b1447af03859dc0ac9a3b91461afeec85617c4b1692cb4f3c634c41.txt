Not sure what to do next.;;;After doing a lot of reading through Google and this subbreddit, I've convinced myself I have ADD. I'm 23 years old, excelled in high school but dropped out of college due to it not feeling rewarding. I have a decent job in IT, but I am required to keep myself on task and am on the verge of being fired due to just not being able to accomplish anything in a timely manner. My relationship is in shambles due to my own anger and apathy. The list of potential symptoms goes on. I don't want to blame my actions on a condition, but after reading here it seems like my symptoms line up perfectly with ADD.   But here's my question, I don't have health insurance. My work offers insurance coverage but I have to potentially wait until July of next year to get coverage or be charged for each month that has passed since July. Should I see a physician and get diagnosed and meds without insurance or wait? The potential benefit of medication is exciting to me but I don't want to have a "pre-existing condition" and never be able to get it covered. Thanks for any help or insight.
