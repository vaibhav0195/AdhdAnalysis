1b54dfe8a5dac96d1e2d51551a29dbcf9545ee62419a729fa26a7810e43e1002;;;Just took vyvance for the first time, feeling quite euphoric. Should I be worried?;;;I just took 70mg of vyvance for the first time (6:30 am est, now its 9:30 am est) and im feeling pretty euphoric. since this is an amphetamine im probably high. however im worried about when i will crash, and how hard i will crash. id also like to know how many days this euphoric feeling will last for me. id rather not have it for that long if it means i crash hard later in the day.   thanks for reading, sorry for the sloppy text im on mobile right now.  fake edit : i was on 72 mg of concerta yesterday, just switched over. only 14, was diagnosed with add/adhd a month ago.
