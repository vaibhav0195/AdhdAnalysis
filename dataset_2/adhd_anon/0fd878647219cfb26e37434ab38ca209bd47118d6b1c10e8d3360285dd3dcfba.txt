I take my medicine everyday and I am usually pretty calm. But every now and then I have days I feel like I didn't take my medicine at all. I know that isn't the case. I have a strict routine I follow. Yesterday was one of those days.... My girlfriend even asked if I took my meds and if I was sure. Which I was.... I even counted to see if i need my refill soon.  It doesn't happen all the time, but it does happen. Is this normal? I take 50mg Vyvanse.
