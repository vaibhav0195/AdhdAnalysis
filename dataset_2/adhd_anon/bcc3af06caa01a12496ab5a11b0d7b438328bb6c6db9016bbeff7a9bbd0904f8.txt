I swear every doc I see has a different version of the "law". Tired of the unnecessary runaround.;;;Specifially, rules about appointments for refills, post dating Rx's, getting multiple Rx's written out at once.  Etc...    I just switch docs because they would only write me 1 Rx at a time and made we wait until I was completely out before I could refill.  But I only had to come in for an actual appointment 2x a year.   Now my new doc says I have to come in  every 3 months for an appointment but I get 3 scripts at once.    So sick of the runaround.  I'm not a criminal, I have a medical condition!  Edit: I live in NC
