I am able to score 7 to 7.5 average on this test. http://www.cogmed.com/working-memory-challenge I dont know if it is good or bad but my friends without adhd tend to score lower (around 6)  But i have recently gotten my diagnosis and my effectiveness on studying physics has skyrocketed. Solving problems/doing  calculation has started to feel so easy.  (biology for example which is more reading based has not seen significant increase)   I dont feel like my increased performance comes from increased focus because i still struggle alot with reading theory only (mind wanderss off) and i have never had problem on focusing while solving problems/calculating.   It is hard to explain but i feel like my iq has raised atleast 20 points or something.   Because of this i have actually fell in love with studying physics again. I feel like i am completely destroying it.   Sorry for my bad english.
