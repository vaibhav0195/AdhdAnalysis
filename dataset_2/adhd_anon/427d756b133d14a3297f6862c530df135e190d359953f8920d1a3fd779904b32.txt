Once you interact with him and understand how his brain works you realize it's just very extreme ADHD but a lot of people don't know what to think at first because he's off the hook. Some assume he's high functioning autistic, Aspergers, etc. I think people tend to categorize people how we perceive them from a distance, anyone else have similar experiences?
