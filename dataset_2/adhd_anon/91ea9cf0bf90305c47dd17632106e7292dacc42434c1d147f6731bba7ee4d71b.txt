I went to my GP for anxiety, and was prescribed paxil, which helped but I told the GP that I still had trouble focusing.  So she referred me to a psychologist for ADHD testing.    Took two months to get the test and results.  I didn't get to look at the results, whatever they were, but the psychologist, who I only spoke to for 10 minutes when he gave me his diagnosis, said I didn't have signs of any deficit, and kind of insinuated that I was too smart to have ADHD.  He said the reason my grades were low was that I spend too much time watching TV and playing video games, both of which I have a hard time doing because I can't sit down and pay attention to them for that long.  When I am sitting down to study I study in short bursts, but end up wasting a lot of time checking stuff I think of while trying to focus on my work.  (Bank account balances, what the prices are on something I've been thinking about buying, buying stuff I don't need, etc.)    In the end, after saying "He thinks.., no he *knows* I don't have ADHD" he said I just need to work on my self-discipline and that my lack of focus is because of my anxiety.  It kind of got me down because I got my hopes up that I would be able to get treatment for this problem.  I pictured myself being able to sit down and play video games without getting bored, or work on my hobbies without getting distracted with 20 different things I don't really care about.  Sorry for the wall of text, but it's been bothering me.  Anything I  should do?  Or should I take his advice, which is pretty much what I've already known and have been trying to work on to no avail?  Maybe I really don't have ADHD and I'm just lazy and impulsive?
