We talked about my suspicions that I have adhd as well as other potential cause of my symptoms (general anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, among others). we talked about that for maybe 30 minutes, and then he moved strait to medications, and wrote me perceptions for lamictal and adderall. I have not yet been diagnosed with anything, is this sort of thing common practice, or should it be cause for concern? The doc was Dr. Sang Suh so if anyone has experience with him and would care to share their experience with him that'd be great too!
