Of course not! I'm a disaster! I booked an appointment with a new psychiatrist (old one not taking new patients, which I count as now), and just got back from the appointment.  He wants me to do a 5 day at home EEG to check for seizure activity. Wha?  My SO actually has epilepsy, with complex partial and grand mal seizures, diagnosed since we started dating, so I'm pretty familiar with this stuff. I know absence/simple partial/complex partial seizures can manifest as "zoning out" and cause memory issues... But I've never heard of doing this in relation to ADHD treatment. My SO only did a 3 day EEG, for actual epilepsy with obvious seizures!   He said he wanted to do the EEG after I talked about how my SO's seizures were affecting my sleep, and I'm wondering if it would have come up if epilepsy wasn't discussed?   Has anyone else done this?  Dr. says insurance will cover it 100%, so I guess it can't hurt? The EEG company is supposed to call me in the next few days to schedule it. Should I just go ahead and do this? It seems excessive, but I am not a doctor, of course..
