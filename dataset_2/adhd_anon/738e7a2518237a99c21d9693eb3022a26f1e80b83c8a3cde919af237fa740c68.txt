Here's what we did next.;;;I was going to call this post "Fun With Bruxism", but that didn't seem like a very descriptive subject line.  **tl;dr** - bruxism (jaw clenching) is a possible side effect of stimulants. It can show up as a head and neck/shoulder pain, and you might not have any pain in your jaw or even notice that you’re clenching your teeth (at least at first.) If you’re having headaches and neck pain a lot, talk to your dentist and to the doctor who  prescribes your ADHD meds about the possibility that you're clenching your jaw. If you're having persistent pain in your jaw, **get yourself to a dentist ASAP**. This symptom has a lot of possible causes, and none of them are things you want to mess around with.   Last week I started having some pretty bad pain in my jaw near my back teeth. My first assumption was that my wisdom teeth were coming in, so I went in to see my dentist. He poked around in my mouth, moved my jaw in different ways and noticed it was making a slight clicking noise, and said that it’s probably bruxism. He gave me a list of instructions for how to treat it on my own, and told me to call him in two weeks and let him know how it went.  The thing I want to emphasize is that up until this happened, I wasn’t aware that I was clenching my jaw at all. I tend to get headaches in the afternoon, and before now I just assumed that it was my medication wearing off, but right around the time my jaw started hurting they got a lot worse (to the point that Aleve + Tylenol barely took the edge off) and starting showing up around the clock. It turns out that [tension in your jaw can cause headaches](http://www.migrainetrust.org/factsheet-jaw-tension-in-migraine-and-headaches-10889), as well as pain in your neck and shoulders (two other things I’ve had problems with, and which I’d previously attributed to working at a computer all day.)  Below are the home treatment suggestions my dentist gave me to follow for the next two weeks. Most of them are pretty non-invasive and safe, but if you have *any* questions about anything, ask your dentist and/or your doctor.  1. **Keep your teeth apart.** If your teeth aren’t touching then they can’t clench. This is simple but not easy - I’d gotten used to holding my teeth together by default, and forcing my muscles to do something they weren’t used to was pretty painful (but the next two steps helped with this). If you have any questions about proper jaw posture, ask your dentist. 2. **Use warm wet compresses on your jaw.** A paper towel run under a warm faucet is just fine.My dentist recommended doing this for about five minutes as often as possible, up to once an hour during the day if need be. I’ve been doing it every couple of hours during work breaks. 3. **Take over-the-counter anti-inflammatory meds.** Specifically, I’m supposed to take them consistently (so that it’s always in my system) for at least two weeks, even if my jaw isn’t hurting. This is something you definitely should **discuss with your doctor before you try it**, because using NSAIDs on the regular carries its own risks. 4. **Don’t open your mouth any wider than your thumb**. The way my dentist explained it, opening your mouth wide causes your jaw muscles to tense, and we’re trying to keep them from doing that as much as possible for a while. This may not be necessary or helpful for everyone  - ask your dentist. 5. **Eat soft-ish food in bite-sized pieces.** Related to the above, my food has to be smaller that my thumb. I’m also supposed to avoid biting down and tearing food with my teeth as much as possible. This means no crusty bread or raw veggies, no chewing gum, no tough meats/meat-like things (which I mention because I’m a vegetarian), and I have to be the snooty asshole who eats his pizza with a knife and fork for a while. It’s annoying, but it’s all to give my jaw muscles a break. As with step #4, this might be overkill for some people. **Ask your dentist**. 6. **Sleep on your back if you can.** Other positions can force your teeth together, which is exactly what we don’t want. This was definitely the worst one for me, but it also seemed to help a lot. I managed to get through all of last night without flipping over. Even though it was really uncomfortable and I’m pretty sure I got less actual sleep than when I’m on my side, I *still* felt a lot better and more rested than I normally do. If you’ve got issues with sleep apnea or something else that makes it difficult to sleep on your back, **talk to your doctor**.  I cannot overemphasize that you should **talk to your doctor and/or dentist** if you think you’re having this problem. I’m only describing my own case and what’s worked for me. So far I’m seeing some pretty solid improvement with the above measures, but you may not need to do everything I’m doing, or you may need to do other things like adjust your medication or wear a night guard. I can’t answer questions about what degree and type of treatment will be necessary or helpful for you.

You will be held gently accountable (which is a good thing!) and we can check in with you...helping YOU get things done.  *I suggest you read the whole post to be MORE successful, so put in the little extra initial effort and continue reading....*  *** ## Choose the participation method that works for you: * **Most important task** - Share one (or a couple) **HIGH-PRIORITY** tasks that you really would like to finally finish.  *(Ex. Set a doctors appointment, finish assignment, clean the kitchen...whatever YOU think is most important.)* * **Make a list** - Post a list of all the things you want to accomplish this week.  *(I highly recommend identifying the top 3 priorities.)* * **Feed your soul** - Sometimes by relaxing and having fun we have more energy to get more done. **List a couple FUN items to make your list more exciting.**  **Need/Want to copy last week's list *verbatim*?  Absolutely DO SO!**  *Those might be your keystone habits. Once you start doing those regularly you are able to do more. soon they will be automatic and you can put your focus elsewhere.*  *** By sharing our goal(s) with this understanding community, we can keep each other **accountable**...and **celebrate our successes**, large or small!  **Don’t forget to return for [Win Wedenesday] to flaunt your successes!**  ;-)  By getting one small task done it creates **momentum**, **trust** in yourself, **confidence**, and you will feel like doing more.  *** ## Suggested Guidelines * **Prioritize your list.** One thing you want to get done (or start). What is the most important thing for you? (If making a list works best for you feel free to do that too!) * **Add a finish OR start deadline.** By committing to a date/time, we can check on your progress. * **Edit your comment when done.** - Come back and edit your comment when you have finished your goal. We can celebrate that (and then people won't check on you). * **Small start.** - Share what SMALL (under 10 minutes) commitment you can make towards your goal.  *I found when my clients didn’t reach their goals 90% of the time they never started...this will help you break through the initial barrier.*  *** ## Tips * Your tasks/goals should ideally be S.M.A.R.T goals: **Specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound** * **Measurable** - Make sure you can be able to say YES I DID THIS. **Study enough** is not measurable.  Study 2 hours is. * **Break it down** - Instead of saying clean my room...it might help to say, “Clean room for 10 minutes or pick up trash in room.” * **Write it down elsewhere** - Sticky note by computer.  Google calendar.  Agenda.  Write it down so you don't forget.  Our working memories are flaky.... * **Start small...build up slowly** - We want to build on small successes so committing to cleaning your entire house might be a bit too much to handle.  Pick a room (or a task like ‘pick up dirty laundry’)  instead. * **Want to study for 2 hours a day?** *Commit to studying 30 minutes to make it easier on you.*  *** ## Examples from previous weeks: * Tidy room. * Buy car. * Go to work. * Attend all my classes on time. * Reschedule appointment. * Mornings: brush teeth &amp; meditate.  Evenings: brush teeth, meditate, journal. * Pay bills. * Plan vacation. * Go to the gym 3x this week. * Break down chores by days so I can have 'a day off with my darling' before he leaves. * **Start** *[something]*. “Spend 5 minutes on writing my paper.”  *** ## *It’s now easier to respond!  Just copy/paste the below into your comment.*  	## Daily Habit / Procrastinated Project / Soul-Feeding 	* **What?** - 	* **How much time?** - 	* **When?** - 	* **Potential Obstacles?** - 	* **Check in on me? When?** - 	* **Small Start** - 	* **Reward** - 	* **Something fun you want to do this week** - 	* **Daily Habit** -  *** Daily list template, if that suits you better.  	## Monday --   	* Item 	## Tuesday -- 	## Wednesday -- 	## Thursday -- 	## Friday -- 	## Saturday --   	## Sunday --  *** Don’t forget to **brag about your accomplishments in Win Wednesday** on Wednesday.  **Celebrating/acknowledging your wins is just as important as actually getting stuff done.**  *** **TL,DR: Share what you want to accomplish this week and how you will do it. Having people check on you via Reddit is extremely helpful!**
