The problem says to use 3, 4-sided dice and i misread it and solved it using 4, 6-sided dice. Unfortunately, last year's homework was the same problem but with the numbers changed; 4, 6-sided dice. It looks as though I slipped up while plagiarizing, but all I did was misread the problem.  I've always had problems with working too quickly, misreading problems, all that stupid shit i never thought really mattered. I'm diagnosed ADHD and Tourette's and I am often very impatient, so I work very quickly. I am also very good at math, which helps me work quickly.  Nobody believes me but my friends. I keep getting rejected by administration and now i have one final chance, the appeal, to prevent a mark on my record and large point reduction in the class. The deans i ask for advice tell me people in the appeal  hearing are unlikely to understand my argument, that it is convoluted and sounds like im just trying to make excuses.  I feel like shit. There are a lot of factors that caused this but I know it is largely due to my personality. I feel so hopeless and like people like me never make it in society because nobody understands how I am wired.  I just need to vent. I don't think there's much advice to be given here. If there is, please tell me, but i mostly just feel bad about myself.  Thank you for taking the time to read this
