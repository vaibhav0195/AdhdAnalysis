202b1eaad6a6fcfec166911b66bf6edf5d310d2b964e3f1b1d5f486fac17cb5f;;;I was prescribed provigil which worked perfectly for my ADHD when I was 15, has anyone else had any experience with it.;;;I was diagnosed with ADD when I was 10, but I wasn't put on medication until I was 15 and I stopped taking it when I was 16 (parents really were not motivated to keep up with my script). Now I am 21 and have been going to psychiatrists on and off since I was 19 mostly due to money problems, because I was honest about previously being addicted to Opiates for a while about a year and a half ago all that they will prescribe me is strattera, which I was taking for about 5 months, during that time I was able to slightly focus better, but I got severe depression and was constantly tired, and she would not prescribe me anything else.   Now, I am unemployed and have no insurance and have been clean for a year and a half. I try to motivate myself to get myself out of this situation, but am constantly distracted and keep pushing things off. I can't seem to get things together and make them work for me and every time I try I fail.   I have also tried to get prescribed provigil again for my add when I was seeing a psychiatrist, she wouldn't prescribe it saying that they could only prescribe it for work shift sleep disorder. When I was on it though I was able to focus, I was getting straight A's, I was exercising daily, could manage my money, and had the motivation to do anything I needed to be able to do.  Edit: Sorry, I don't know where I was going with half of this.
