(27 years old);;;I have already booked an appointment with my doctor about it for tomorrow and am starting down the path to take a look at diagnosis and possible treatment if it is, in fact, what I believe it is.  I started thinking I might have it, oddly enough, while reading r/drugs and reading their AMA series on Amphetamines.  I was interested in what the effects were and then, I think someone made a comment about different reactions to Amphetamines like Adderall if you have ADD.  I decided to google and find out what exactly the symptoms of ADD/ADHD was, having been misinformed all my life.    For the longest time I was under the impression that people with ADD/ADHD were just hyper, off the wall trouble making types.  So imagine my surprise when I started reading down the list of symptoms and found huge correlations to my issues, which I just though boiled down to laziness, etc.  My story is basically this; at a young age, I was identified as a gifted kid.  In grade 3, I'd leave my classroom for about an hour, twice a week, and do fun "problem solving" type problems.  Eventually, they recommended I enter a gifted program for Grade 4.  I stuggled a bit but, for the most part, enjoyed that year, besides the stress of changing schools and suddenly being friendless in a new school.  The next year, we moved to another city.  I spent the first two months in a normal 5th Grade class but then was quickly invited to a gifted program in this city.  It was great up until around the end of Grade 6 and starting of Grade 7 when the homework and assignments started to pile up.  Previous to this, I was able to pick most of the work I wanted to focus on (writing stories, etc) and it wasn't a problem.  Suddenly, I found myself unable to complete homework and assignments.  My teacher and my parents were both exasperated trying to get me to focus on getting the assignments complete and I was getting rather depressed myself.  But whenever I sat down to work on homework, I would always end up sitting there feeling this torturous feeling until I just would give up, after barely starting, and do something else.  It wasn't like the work was even difficult, it was just so boring.  My parents and I seemed to have the same thoughts on the potential of ADD/ADHD and how it couldn't be my problem because I wasn't 'hyper' and I had no trouble concentrating on some things. (Namely video games, some novels, TV, etc)  High school was even more of a train-wreck.  I was recommended not to continue in the gifted program for high school (imagine the blow to my already crappy self-esteem) and ended up in a new school with no friends, once again.  I would coast through my high school career with frustrated teachers.  I would listen to all the lessons but never take notes, even when I would get in trouble for not doing so.  I just couldn't force myself to take them.  I would answer questions in class and would understand all the subject matter but I'd never do homework.  My school marks were all in the 50s to low 70s because I would only complete tests and exams (which I got 90s on).  It was frustrating.  It continues to this day, though in less stressful ways, thank goodness.  Whenever the home starts to get messy, and the wife starts to nag about getting housework down and working on projects around the home, I get stressed out and angry at her.  I always tell her to "give me a few minutes to relax!" and get easily side-tracked when working on them.  Even though I know it'd be just easier to get things done and then focus on what I'd like to do, I just have such a hard time doing so.  The **TL:DR** of it is basically this; Didn't consider ADD/ADHD to be my problem, just laziness, until I just recently read the symptoms and realized that you don't have to be bouncing-off-the-wall-hyper and that hyperfocus is, paradoxically, a symptom of it.  I do realize that I still might not have it, which is why I look forward to finding out for sure.  Especially since the huge impact it could have had on my life.  **Couple of quick questions for diagnosed sufferers**  1.  Do you ever have this "foggy" feeling, as if you can't really think as well as you feel you should be able to?  It's hard for me to describe besides feeling like I have some sort of "brain fog".  2.  Are you at all a low energy type of person?  I have always been someone who is more sedentary or low energy.  I do things like constantly blab someone's ear off or tap my foot but if I told people I thought I had ADD/ADHD, I'm sure they'd bring up how low energy I am as a counter-point.  3.  Not a question but please, I'd appreciate people who have been diagnosed with ADD/ADHD to fire me a personal message, I wouldn't mind learning a little more about what it has been like.  4.  Finally, any links to non-medication related strategies for making dealing with things easier?  Thanks a ton, in advance.
