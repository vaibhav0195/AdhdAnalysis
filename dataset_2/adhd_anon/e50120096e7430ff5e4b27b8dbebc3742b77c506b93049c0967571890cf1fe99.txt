Diagnosed as kid a couple times, but parents didn't believe in it / didn't want me on drugs. Have anxiety, social issues and memory problems most of my life. It comes and goes from time to time though in severity, but a lot of times I feel like I'm not really paying attention to my own life.  I've been off and on anxiety medication throughout my life due to poop related issues when I get anxious, but they only help that particular symptom. Getting to the conversation with my doctor to get anxiety meds was incredibly difficult for me. I'm the type of guy who is afraid to ask for any of the "fun" drugs because of judgement.  Lately I've been experiencing super fuzzy days where I feel like I'm completely disconnected. I've been trying to learn some front end stack coding and it seems to get really bad once I start getting deep into it.  So, how do I start? Do I go to a therapist or a doctor? I haven't been to my GP in years, I'm kinda bad about going to doctors/dentists and so on because it acknowledges something is wrong, if that makes sense.  When I bring it up, will my doctor be able to look up any past diagnoses and will that help?  The only time I ever really brought it up after my family doc who did my young diagnoses, the doctor was immediately dismissive (I stopped going to him later for similar reasons, but it kinda left me with this uneasy feeling towards bringing it up, which seems pretty common based on my reading)  Thanks and sorry for the text wall.
