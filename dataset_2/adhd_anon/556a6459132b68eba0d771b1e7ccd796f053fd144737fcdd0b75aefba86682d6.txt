I was diagnosed about 5 weeks ago. I had a melt down at school and had to take some time away. The school councillor gave me a test and said that it was quite likely that I have ADHD. She managed to get me an emergency session with a psych and she agreed that I likely have adhd as well as anxiety and depression issues. She made me wait a few weeks to start meds and on Friday i was given a prescription for Dexedrine 5 mg per day. I took one that morning and felt nothing. I took one yesterday and had to use an energy drink to get me going. I have taken another on today and I can't say that i really feel anything. What am I supposed to feel? What is supposed to happen? I really just sort of feel let down. I have heard about how the meds can turn your life around. I am not experiencing that. Anyone have any input?

I have since been put on 10 mg Dexedrine Spansules and it seems to be helping with motivation and concentration which has been fantastic. I have also been learning a great deal about myself and ADHD (I am primarily inattentive) and what it has cost me over the years. One of the things that I have a really hard time with is emotional control. I am quick to anger, I take criticism very poorly and have had really bad bouts of depression and anxiety in the past and I am currently being treated for depression/anxiety as well as the ADHD now.  I am an adult student and the stress is really hard to take sometimes. I am paranoid that I get by based on instructors just taking pity on me or feeling sorry for me. I have never felt like any successes have been mine alone. I feel like it's always because of someone or something else's influence. I don't want to feel this way anymore. I want to find my own success or at least recognize that I have had some success in this world.
