be066ee981cb0cb05cc5076022c72c1a97664132b14d20d22b71fc803799afe3;;;Starting medication for the first time tomorrow, any advice?;;;I'm starting Concerta XL 18mg tomorrow. Picked it up from the pharmacist today and going to take my first pill it in the morning before work. Has anyone any experience with this medication, any side effects I should look out for? My goal is to improve my quality of life though medication and CBT. The problems I've been suffering with for many years are: - Low self esteem - Depression (fluctuates from mild to moderately severe at times) - Anxiety - Bad social skills - OCD Tenancies - Procrastination - Anger outbursts - Extremely active mind (will not shut up!)  I've been diagnosed with ADHD-C aged 20. I think inattentiveness holds me back the most. I understand that medication effects everyone differently and so I will soon find out whether this will work out. I've read through so many posts on this sub Reddit and it's amazing to see that I am not alone and how there are so many people out there just like me battling though the same issues. I've suffered in silence for such a long time. I want to start living the life I've always wanted to and I hope this will be the beginning of it. Thanks for taking the time to read this. Have a good day.
