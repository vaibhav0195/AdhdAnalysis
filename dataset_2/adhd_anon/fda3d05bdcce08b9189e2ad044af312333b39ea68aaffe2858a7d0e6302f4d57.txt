I realize that I need help, but everything seems like merely a struggle towards the inevitable.    I failed to get documentation to two missed tests. I don't want to have to retake the course but if I tough it out my GPA may be affected for my internship application.   I feel like the reason we struggle so much is because we strive to accomplish too many things. We were not below average at birth, so why are we having what seems to be the same problems? I believe my conditions were manageable when I had clear goals and wants. Perhaps the cause for inadequacy is because we fail to see how doing X would truly make us happier.
