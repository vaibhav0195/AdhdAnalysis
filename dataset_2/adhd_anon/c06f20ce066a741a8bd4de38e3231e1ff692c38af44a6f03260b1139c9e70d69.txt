I am a 17 year old, currently in my junior year of high school, and have recently noticed that things have just.. well.. gone down hill.  I have struggled with school and other academic programs for most of my life, and was diagnosed with ADHD some time around seventh grade. I was put on medication (focalin XR being the first) and then, over the years, was changed to different prescriptions, such as Adderal, Adderal XR, and vyvanse being the most recent. During these few years, although I was not doing perfectly, everything seemed to be going okay, besides the occasional homework struggle, or failed test.  A few months ago, I decided that I was just going to stop taking my meds, and so I did. I was simply sick of the terrible side effects it gave me, and I was very confident that I could do without them. For a while, I felt extremely confident, and everything was great, until a few moths in when I noticed something. My grades and my work performance were slowly declining, and I noticed that I was becoming less and less motivated to do ANYTHING related to school.   Now, a few months later, I have almost completely given up on school. I have a very hard time getting myself to do any work, and the only thing I do at school is just show up. I have tried and tried but there is just nothing that can seem to get me motivated. So this brings me to my question, reddit; How do you motivate yourself, and/or stay motivated?   I would love to hear some feedback and tips from you guys, and I appreciate if you took some time to read this.  TL;DR - Stopped taking meds, everything was going fine, now it's falling apart.
