10a499ff6551e4318f940bb9e148f4b67b4941d371bc253916f85d78c42dc452;;;Son suspected of having ADHD but looking into it, he behaves quite well in school but is a nightmare with parents - does this mean it is not ADHD?;;;So my wife says she read somewhere since he does not exhibit the traits we are familiar with at home in the school place, it may not be ADHD.  For a short summary, he is extremely obstinate and argumentative with anything that does not go according to his plan.  When he is arguing he does not care about consequences - he will call us stupid and idiot and will hit on occasion without inhibition.  He is 7 years old.  Any advice / suggestions would be appreciated.  I am new to ADHD forums and the disorder.
