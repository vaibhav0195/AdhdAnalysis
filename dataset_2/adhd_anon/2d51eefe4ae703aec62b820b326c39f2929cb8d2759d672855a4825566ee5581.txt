I have been struggling, but have made it through college and ~5 years of work without getting fired.  Until today.    I had a new job in finance for about a month (I narrowly escaped getting fired from the last job).  I know, deep down, it's probably for the best because the #1 requirement for accountants/financial analysts is attention to detail.  I will try not to bore you with too many details about why this makes me feel like a terrible failure, but the bottom line is that I no longer have an income and just signed a 12 month lease in a new city (where I relocated for work).  I am not sure what type of advice it is that I am looking for, but I'm just trying to figure out what to do next.  It seems clear that corporate finance is not the right field for me (or anyone with ADD), but I don't know how I'm supposed to survive out here.  I'm 29 years old and sometimes I just feel like a child that can't get himself together.  I genuinely tried checking my work to the best of my ability every time, but I still made mistakes, which led to me being let go today.  Can anyone give some helpful advice?  I want to be successful in life and I'm no longer sure how to do it.  If you've read this far, I would just like to genuinely say "thank you" from one internet stranger to another.  Also, if there is a better place for this post just let me know and I'll x-post it.
