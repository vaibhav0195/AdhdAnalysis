I like my current job, but the senior staff has passed me over for promotion after promotion, and they don't think very much of me.  I've only gotten feedback that I need to focus.  Tomorrow I'm going on Adderall.  I'm wondering if I should tell them that I've had ADHD for the past 7 years.  Have any of you ever done this?  What happens.  I don't know if they'll "give me another chance" now that I'm starting treatment, or if they'll be like: "Oh, we have a disabled guy, we can't do anything with him."
