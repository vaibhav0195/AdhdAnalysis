Since I've been off, throughout middle, high school and now college I struggle with concentration, impulse control, depression, motivation and being able to do a task at all. As a result I've suffered bad grades, debt and going through jobs when I just couldn't stand to be there anymore.   I've trained myself to be more anchored in tasks I need to do, but if I need to do something and it's not of the utmost importance I will not do it, at all.  I went to my doctor recently to get diagnosed for ADHD but instead got prescribed Buspar, an anti anxiety. I understand my doctors hesitation to give out Adderall at all, although from taking my friends or some I've bought I feel as though all my problems are gone, I'm the person I want to be. Of course I will not talk about me doing this with my doctor, I just fear that he thinks I'm just trying to get drugs per my age (21).      I don't know what I was trying to accomplish here by posting this, I just needed to vent.      I plan on making an appointment with a psychiatrist who specializes in adult ADHD. Has anyone around my age been through the same type of experience?
