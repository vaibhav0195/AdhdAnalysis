Diagnosed as an adult, reading this may help if similar.;;;I have seen this on occasion, and perhaps more often since I have paid more attention over the past week.  I am prescribed IR Adderall, and I took my dosage (30mg) around noon (I take one in AM also but woke up late, so skipped it).  Around 5pm, I saw my monitors look something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/4CurbbG.png).   Yeah, meds are wearing off for sure...noticed a loss 15 minutes earlier maybe, but that much open is a sign for us all, of course.  **At this point, I'm still wanting to be productive, but now my mind is racing even more than when not medicated (or on, mind races a bit on meds but I can control much better) but the hyperactivity, at least physically, was manifesting itself.**  I'd curse and stomp if (minor) things like my computer freezing occured.  I'd get fidgety while sitting down.  When typing, I would make typos because it almost felt like I lost full control of my extremities in random bursts.  I was diagnosed as an inattentive type, however--so maybe this is a form of the inattentiveness manifesting itself as a hyperactive symptom?  I say this because after my introspection and such, I became comfortable with my diagnosis (at age 20, 6+ years ago) because I was a quiet hyperactive as a kid--that is, hyperactivity led to consequences so negative (few friends, verbally and at times physically abusive parents) that it manifested as inattentive.  I know this is a common thing with adults that struggle with their (late) diagnosis, so wanted to point a couple personal examples like that out.  There are other hyperactive things I likely was doing before I took my afternoon dosage around 6pm, which helped kinda...but it's half the AM/noon dose because I like falling asleep easily.    I will ask my doc about this when I see him next month, **but is this the same with anyone else?**  I was curious if there is a correlation either through anecdotes or a study if someone can find such a thing for me to look at.  Also, **can lowering dosage alleviate this?**  My dosage (75mg--30-30-15 at am-noon-afternoon respectively) **is quite high** but lowering it will take time to get used to, as I have been at this dosage for 6+ months.  **TL;DR--I am a diagnosed inattentive that gets hyperactive on occasion when meds wear off, perhaps even when on meds.  How can I stop this?  Is this common--hyperactives becoming inattentives or vice versa?**
