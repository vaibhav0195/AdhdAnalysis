3fb9ba8926c896c95c67c5c8b68c55232fb56e1da6ebe0a5731c4675e1ab4480;;;Confused on my medication refill;;;hey yall! so i thought id post in this one and get a little INSIGHT. I had called my pharmacy to see if i was able to get a early refill on my adderall and it looks like i can do it up to 3 days early. now since i will be refilling it early on the 27th of this month im hoping this means i can next fill it a month from the 27th. i always get confused with my refills ;/ . i fill it at a costco and unfortunatley where i am at the pharmacey closes early on the weekends ( and i work late during the weekend) so when it comes around to my refill its always on the weekend when im unavaiable to get it. So thats why i fill it early.  i hopefully will be able to fill it if i get a 30 day supply and fill it on the 27th? also i was told i can fill it early this time, when i got my script on the 1st of may and can fill it on the 27th. hopeing this is accurate. i apologize if this doesnt make sense! thanks guys!!
