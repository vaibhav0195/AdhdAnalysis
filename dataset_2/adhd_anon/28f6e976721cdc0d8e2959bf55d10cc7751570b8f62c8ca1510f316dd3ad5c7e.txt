28f6e976721cdc0d8e2959bf55d10cc7751570b8f62c8ca1510f316dd3ad5c7e;;;Question for people in Ontario, Canada. GP referred me to clinic, they said it cost $875 to get evaluated. What other options do I have?;;;They said psychiatrists are covered by OHIP, but that the psychologists (who are to diagnose me) over 3 sessions are not and would cost $875. Is it the psychiatrists who can give me a prescription for meds or is it the psychologists? I told her I was a student that just graduated not on insurance, but she said this price so nonchalantly like it was nothing. I feel like ADD and anxiety is ruining my life, what else can I do?
