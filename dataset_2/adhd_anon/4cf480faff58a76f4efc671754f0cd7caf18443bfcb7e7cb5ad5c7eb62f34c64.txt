4cf480faff58a76f4efc671754f0cd7caf18443bfcb7e7cb5ad5c7eb62f34c64;;;Need advice about meds.;;;So after finding out I had ADHD last year I started taking meds. I was in 9th grade, my parents had known since I was in 2nd grade but didn't think it pertinent until I started highschool and my grades actually started to count. As soon as I found the right medicine (Concerta - 54mg i think) My grades increased exponentially. My problem is I hate the side affects with a burning passion. I hate no being hungry, I hate being moody when I get home, and I hate getting headaches and stomach aches FROM the lack of nutrition I absorb throughout the day. At the same time, I really like doing well in school. I was just wondering if anyone had, had a similar experience and could shed some light on the subject for me or give me some advice etc.  Thanks!
