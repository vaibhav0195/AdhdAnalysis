24a8b622ff2aab8ff5bddf58e8073d93c56341355185bf78d8ebadfdbe733624;;;Hard time describing symptoms;;;So I was diagnosed a month ago but I wanted to double check the diagnosis because it was a very short interview. I'm planning on going to an adhd testing site of some sort in a month or so and wanted to know how do I describe my struggles and symptoms to a psychiatrist? Especially when I don't even remember my childhood all that well cuz of memory issues. **TLDR; How do I accurately portray my feelings without sounding like a drug seeker or breaking down and crying?** Thanks !!
