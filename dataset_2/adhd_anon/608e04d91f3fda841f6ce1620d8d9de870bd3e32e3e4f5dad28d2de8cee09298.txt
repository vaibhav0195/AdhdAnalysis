Currently, it's my phone but I can't keep using it in class and meetings. I've tried thinking putty, the bike chain fidget, a stress ball, and a Rubik's cube. The Rubik's cube worked the best but I can't solve it so it's just kind of frustrating.I just bought a 2x2 cube, so we'll see how that works. Can anyone suggest something similar or maybe fidgets just don't work for me?
