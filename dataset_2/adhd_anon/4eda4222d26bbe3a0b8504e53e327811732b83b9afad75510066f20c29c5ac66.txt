I've been thinking about tutoring Junior High level and above, and was wondering if anyone thought focusing on people with ADHD is something parents/college students would look for.   My background - Had adhd all my life, but wasn't diagnosed until halfway through law school. I graduated and am studying for the Bar exam, but want to pick up some extra cash. Coming to my diagnosis has changed my outlook in my own life, and I can't help but look back at how much I struggled through school thinking I was lazy and constantly frustrated with my own performance. I knew I was smart - at least smart enough - so I pushed everything to the last minute (finishing High School essays the class period before they were due). I would ace tests/last minute essays, but my grades would tank because I would never do my homework. The only thing that saved my getting into college were my standardized test scores. The reason, I now know, is because I was able to hyperfocus on those tests. I scored in the top 10% on both my SAT and the LSAT.  Long story short, I think that if I had an earlier diagnosis, and if I had a tutor that understood my feelings/learning style and worked with me, my journey would have been a lot easier. So, would you look for a tutor that has ADHD?   This isn't meant to be a solicitation (although if you're in Los Angeles and need a tutor, PM me :), it's a genuine question because I've been thinking about how needlessly frustrating school was for me growing up. I'd just really like to help a kid/young college student who has adhd succeed...and law school was expensive.  I just wanted to hear if my adhd sub thought this could be a good idea. Thanks!
