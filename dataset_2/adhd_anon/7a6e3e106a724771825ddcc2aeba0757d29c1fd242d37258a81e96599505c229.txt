Recently, since I'm now able to support myself, I went to the doctor and was put on meds. This was a month or so ago. At first it was life changing. I was able to actually work on the things I was supposed to be working, instead of just the things that interested me. The only side effects I noticed was a strong lack of appetite and an urge to smoke more frequently. Now, about a month later, the effects seem to be much weaker. I can still focus more often than before, and I'm not at my pre-meds level, but I feel like I'm still way below what a normal person should be. Also, for some reason I've started having an appetite again. I've noticed that if I don't sleep as much and as well as I should, the meds seem to not work at all and I'm hungry all day.  Is this normal?
