Sudden restlessness/anxiety out of nowhere!?;;;Looking for people who have had similar experiences/some peace of mind! -Have OCD and ADHD   -Taking zoloft 75mg and adderall 10-20mg  -Was drinking ~2 cups of coffee and recently stopped cold turkey  -As of a few days ago, getting super internal restless/anxious (dont know the difference) feeling out of nowhere, usually around night time  -Thought maybe the zoloft was too high so I decided to go back down to 50 mg  -The restlessness has been bad enough i've been using ativan to try to calm down, did that tonight, hasn't helped!  -Havent had these symptoms for like half a year, and now they're back!  -Don't get to see my psych for another two weeks, desperate for some comfort: why might this be happening? what might help? anyone else out there experience this?  tl;dr: sudden feelings of restlessness/anxiety i havent felt in months, only things that have changed include cutting out coffee, reducing my zoloft by 15mg thinking that might be the culprit, looking for some comfort/answers until i can see my psych :(   thanks you guys!!!!
