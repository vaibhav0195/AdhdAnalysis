Feel free to read only the bolded text and/or the tl/dr at the end!**   **I'm on a waiting list for a psychologist &amp; psychiatrist in depth assessment** for possible ADHD. At least 4 weeks until they call me to set up an appointment. After doing quite a bit of research, **I highly suspect that I have ADHD as well as some depression &amp; anxiety.**  The thing is, I am really struggling, have been for at least a year with ADHD like syptoms. I have huge demands at work, and despite religious use of todo lists I can't get anything done (or started). I'm constantly forgetting things at work, sometimes with disastrous consequences. I can't find motivation to do anything but the simplest tasks (and if I try to tackle anything big, I can never finish it).  Home life is similar but not really bothering me since I live alone. **Work life scares me because I've been given huge responsibilities over the last year and I'm not sure I can handle them.**  **I'm pretty sure I could see my family doctor and have drugs-in-hand by tomorrow** (for depression, anxiety, ADHD, whatever I ask for considering my symptoms). He went through the classic ADHD check-list when I asked him for a referral and checked just about everything off (except hyperactivity). **But that just doesn't seem wise**, given the possibility of misdiagnosis, and the fact that I have a much more in-depth assessment with ADHD trained professionals, if I can just make it through the next month or two.   4+ weeks seems like 10 years to me right now. **Can /r/adhd give me some helpful suggestions, feedback, anything** to help me get through the next few weeks, when it feels like everything is about to come crashing down on my head?   **tl/dr; assessment in 4 (or more) weeks. Not sure if I can wait, not sure what to do!** (not looking for self-medication, medical advice. Doing this all 'by the book').

Due to job circumstances &amp; a huge increase in responsibilities in the last year, it has been a huge struggle.  A tiny part of my job is managing a large (in my mind, ~$500K) budget, including purchasing hardware, software and services. I get many invoices from many vendors, some of whom are pretty sloppy with the details (double billing, not sending invoices, messing things up royally). I have to sign off on 50+ invoices a month, and I have to scrutinize them in exacting detail. I have to budget and forecast for 1 &amp; 3 years and it all has to be perfect down to the penny.  I constantly miss/forget invoices (they come by mail &amp; email). I miss vendor mistakes and I make my own (paying invoices from the wrong budgets, double paying etc). I can't keep what's been paid and what hasn't straight in my head (and one vendor is _horrible_ for splitting up one order into many, shipping them separately and invoicing separately). I can't do anything consistently so I'm making different mistakes every time, and most times I have to re-figure out how to do everything like it's new. As stuff comes in, I try to keep track of what's been received and what I'm waiting for, but I often lose track, some times we don't get stuff and sometimes I just outright lose stuff.   **Once a month, I'm pretty much reduced to tears trying to pay invoices.**  **Mint.com and pre-authorized payments have really helped me at home, but at work I'm dealing with an issue several orders of magnitude larger.**  Any thoughts? Suggestions? Anyone else dealt with this?  I lay asleep at night worried I'm going to make a million dollar mistake some day.   **[edit] 10 minutes ago, I found out I went over-budget on one item by $3,000. Not a disaster, just another in a year's worth of screw-ups.**
1e0a396c9fc93ee28baa16864fb9d683e041aeeb964d016c0d089cc86fbc625a;;;Thoughts on improving reading comprehension?;;;So I'm still part-way through my ADHD assesment, but one of the first tests we did was a vocabulary test and a reading comprehension test, I go the results for.  On the reading comprehension test (read a couple of paragraphs, answer a few quetsions). I'm in the 70something (I forget) percentile for words per minute, but the 33rd percentile for reading comprehension.  My psychologist told me that the test results were good, and nothing to worry about. But I'm worrying, obviously. Can someone who understands 'percentile' explain to me what this means?  I read a lot for liesure and this kind of rocked my assumption, but I've been doing a lot of reflection, and it seems that I'm only skimming; I could hardly recall 1/10 of the books I read last year, and of those I'd be hard pressed to tell you what they were about, or who the main character was.  **tl/dr; So... any suggestions for increasing reading comprehension, mostly for liesure reading? And how is your reading comprehension?**  _note: Currently undiagnosed, unmedicated, for the next 4 weeks anyway_
