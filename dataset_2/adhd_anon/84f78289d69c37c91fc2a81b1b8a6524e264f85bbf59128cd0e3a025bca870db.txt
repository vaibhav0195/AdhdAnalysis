It's really weird. I normally stare at my homework, feeling like I'm plowing through a giant cloud of distractions and daydreaming just to read basic things, but when the stakes get high, like when taking an exam, I can zoom through everything fine because I have adrenaline. This makes me think that I may be misdiagnosed and I'm just lazy or have bad habits.  What do you guys think? Can any of you relate?
