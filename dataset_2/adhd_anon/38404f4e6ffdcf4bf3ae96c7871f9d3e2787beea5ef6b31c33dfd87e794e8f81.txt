My therapist now has prescribed me Concerta. In school I was always an underachiever. And outside of school I struggle to watch movies, books, tv shows, play, etc. It was always a big effort to do/enjoy anything. Whether in school or in my free time. As a result, I can feel quite down about myself. Not being smart enough, being uninteresting, etc. But I'm hoping that will change. How have your lives changed for the better after your ADHD diagnosis and treatment?
