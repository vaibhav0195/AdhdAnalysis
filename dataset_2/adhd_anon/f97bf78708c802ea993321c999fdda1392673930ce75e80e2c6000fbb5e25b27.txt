f97bf78708c802ea993321c999fdda1392673930ce75e80e2c6000fbb5e25b27;;;Literally feel my ADHD &gt;.&lt;;;;I have been studying chemistry and molar calculations etc. I must have concentrated really well for the first few minutes, working step-by-step through the many levels of the calculations. Once i got to my answer i went back through my working and had a really hard time actually keeping up with the many stages i had just been through!    I had JUST worked it out and then my brain decided it couldn't handle it any more. I managed to come back to it and work it out again s l o w l y.    Once i got a handle of it again i know that i find the calculations really straight-forward. It was just the fact that i had to follow the train of thought in one go that i struggled with.   To be honest, although it was frustrating, i also found it vaguely amusing/curious to *feel* my attention just evaporate in to thin air!
