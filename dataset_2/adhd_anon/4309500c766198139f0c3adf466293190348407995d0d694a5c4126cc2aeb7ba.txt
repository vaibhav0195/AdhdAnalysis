I am the definition of lazy. I procrastinate everything till the last minute, get anxiety and then hyperfocus down half the work, earning me a shitty grade. I lack motivation towards anything considered work. I have always considered myself a "jack of all trades, but master of none." I pick up a ton of different hobbies that I enjoy and get motivated to do for around a week or so, next thing you know I consider that activity more work than fun, and I stop doing it. I have so many half completed projects ranging from making music, to programming videogames that its a joke.  On top of being lazy, I tend to zone out during important lectures and come back missing tons of notes (if im even motivated to take them). I also have a nasty habit of picking my fingers and my gf constantly has to stop me from playing/messing with random things while watching tv.  Sorry for the wall of text, but I am nervous that I am blaming all of this stuff on ADHD-PI and I don't have it. I guess only a doctor can diagnose me, but does anyone who's been diagnosed share my same symptoms?
