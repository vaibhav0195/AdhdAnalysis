5216584582efcef65f13eb5c615176db5284dd67a49e4faa95d2e7b808b6215c;;;I just finished reading Dr. Barkley's Book, "Taking Charge of Adult ADHD" and have to share this.;;;http://www.amazon.ca/Taking-Charge-Adult-Russell-Barkley/dp/1606233386/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1338893370&amp;sr=8-1  Here's the book.  It costs 13 dollars from amazon.  **If you have Adult ADHD**  This is the book for you.  This will help you with job choices, school choices, and how to control your life (and btw, it even recommends that you can put down the book after the medication chapter, because most who get medicated see such a massive improvement on their life that they self correct the behavior)  On top of that it doesn't put everything on the disorder.  It literally says "not everything you do is because of ADHD"  which is a relief because I'm so sick of reading stuff of people saying "I AM THE NEXT STEP OF EVOLUTION BECAUSE I HAVE ADHD AND IT GIVES ME POWERS TO "HYPERFOCUS""  **If you don't have ADHD and don't think it's real**  It will pretty much insult your intelligence, and explain it to you in simple terms how your actions give people low self esteem  **If you have ADHD, but Don't think medicine is the answer**  It will explain to you why ADHD needs to be medicated and how a MAJORITY of people have seen massive improvements with medication.    Also this book will crush your self pride if you think you are better for not taking the pill.  **If you have ADHD, take meds and have no idea what ADHD is and no idea what the meds do**  I find a lot of people so far that I've met in real life through support groups or through reddit/other forums have very little knowledge of what they are up against.  If you want to know the truth buy this book.  I honestly hope people here read this book.  I'm gonna be pretty blunt and honest.  I have no use for this forum because its mostly become a place where people think they have it and ignore many good threads about the science behind it.and skills used.to help.deal with the diagnosis., I only pop in here once in a while to point people in the right direction, and to correct people when they say some garbage information.  I was one of those people that once I got up to my proper dosage everything started to make sense and wasn't hazy anymore, and I started to have that little voice enter my head that was helping me think before I did anything, and actually made me recall past events.    So in conclusion.  Stop posting garbage information about ADHD is a gift, and that medication is the devil, when there is a MAJORITY of people who see AWESOME results on it.
