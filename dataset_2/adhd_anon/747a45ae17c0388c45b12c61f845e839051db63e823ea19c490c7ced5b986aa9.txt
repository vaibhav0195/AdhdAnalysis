In the night, I take 200 mg Lamictal/lamotrigine, omega 3 and b-vitamins (supplement for my vegetarian life). Diagnosed with Bipolar type II and ADHD (the combined type).  With lower doses of Concerta, I've felt tired, bodily fatigue and such, but my psychiatrist doesn't really understand these symptoms/can't explain them. On these lower doses I also haven't really "felt anything"/my ADHD was practically the same, just a hard time with my appetite for a week every time we upped the dosage.  I recently went up to 72, I could finally sense the benefits of medication. My mind has somehow decluttered itself. It's only been a couple of weeks and not to jinx it, I hope this works out! But I keep hearing about people having trouble with falling asleep on these meds, but I somehow have the opposite effect? Like today, I took my medication, ate some food and read some comics and then fell asleep on the couch, gone for several hours!  I've tried to look online on anything about this effect but I can only find articles on problems with lack of sleep. Does anyone of you know how this effect is produced? Can it be an interaction with Wellbutrin or anything else?  tl;dr: I feel sleepy on Concerta. How does that work?
