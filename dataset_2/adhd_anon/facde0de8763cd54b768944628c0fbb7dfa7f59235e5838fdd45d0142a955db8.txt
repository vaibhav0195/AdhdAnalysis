For example, I just watched Season 1,2, and most of 3 of Breaking Bad in about 2 days. I had things to do, but it was crazy hard to stop. I've been diagnosed with ADHD-Inattention. This compulsion has happened all my life with various avenues (usually I'd stay up very late doing them, or do it all day when I'm procrastinating) and medication seems to help it (I watched Breaking Bad when my medication wore off for the day). Im wondering if this is an ADHD symptom?  Edit: Great responses. I'm actually thinking this may not be hyperfocus. Hyperfocus would be something like "flow" with intense focus and interest. The behavior I'm describing is more of a compulsion, almost addictive-like behavior. I don't want to do what I'm doing, but I can't stop it. It pulls me in with some kind of reward-esque instant gratification. It also gets worse with anxiety, like if I'm procrastinating.   Edit 2: Wow. I'm so relieved and simultaneously interested. It really seems like this is ADHD related.. My people!! Oh my god, I'm so glad to hear from you all. It's really these behaviors that cause so much anguish in my life and destroy many opportunities.   Well, now I'm curious whether medication has had an effect on this for you? Does it help? We gotta figure out a way to stop this..
