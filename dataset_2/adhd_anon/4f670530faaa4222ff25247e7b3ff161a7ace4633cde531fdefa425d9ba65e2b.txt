I've been doing some research into ADHD and I belive I have it. These are the symptoms that match me (extremely closely)  &gt;“zoning out” without realizing it, even in the middle of a conversation extreme distractibility; wandering attention makes it hard to stay on track   &gt;difficulty paying attention or focusing, such as when reading or listening to others   &gt;struggling to complete tasks, even ones that seem simple   &gt;tendency to overlook details, leading to errors or incomplete work   &gt;poor organizational skills (home, office, desk, or car is extremely messy and cluttered)   &gt;tendency to procrastinate  &gt;trouble starting and finishing projects   &gt;chronic lateness   &gt;frequently forgetting appointments, commitments, and deadlines   &gt;constantly losing or misplacing things (keys, wallet, phone, documents, bills)   &gt;underestimating the time it will take you to complete tasks  &gt;sense of underachievement   &gt;doesn’t deal well with frustration   &gt;easily flustered and stressed out   &gt;irritability or mood swings   &gt;trouble staying motivated   &gt;hypersensitivity to criticism   &gt;short, often explosive, temper   &gt;low self-esteem and sense of insecurity  &gt;feelings of inner restlessness, agitation    &gt;getting bored easily   &gt;racing thoughts   &gt;trouble sitting still; constant fidgeting   &gt;craving for excitement   &gt;talking excessively   &gt;doing a million things at once   I was reading through these and I realized its a textbook definition of my life, and has been for quite a while.   The problem is, my parents think that ADD/ADHD is just an excuse for lazy people who want to take drugs so they don't have to improve themselves. I think it's because we used to know a lot of people who's kids had ADHD, and they assumed it was a common thing, I'm not sure    Either way, I would really like to get some kind of  help for it, but im not sure my parents would think the same.
