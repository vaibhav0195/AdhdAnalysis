Okay, onto the problem/question: we have been having arguments daily. I know that some of this comes from the stress of having a new baby but most of it comes from our communication challenges that have stemmed for over a decade. We have always had fights that seems so cyclical. I can’t even really pinpoint how they start but I always forget what we are actually talking about and the communication feels so jumbled that I’m having trouble writing it down now. Often, my forgetfulness combined with my need to make sure that he is not *really* frustrated furthers the conflict. So...I’m wondering if others here feel like this during arguments and how you deal with this? Also, if you have a partner, have they made an effort to learn about ADHD? How have you talked about it or communicated what you need? Do you have rules about how to fight?
