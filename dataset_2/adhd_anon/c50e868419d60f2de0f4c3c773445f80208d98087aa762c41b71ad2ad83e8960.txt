Next week I will be seeing him for the second time and I don't know if it's to early to bring up something like that.   I live in Australia and I've been told that they don't like diagnosing adhd in adults.  I'm really scared, I really just want to get this fixed it's been stopping me from really doing anything my entire life, (I'm 21) but I'm scared that he won't acknowledge it or think I'm lying.
