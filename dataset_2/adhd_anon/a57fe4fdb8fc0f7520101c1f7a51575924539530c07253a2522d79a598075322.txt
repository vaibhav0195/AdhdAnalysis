a57fe4fdb8fc0f7520101c1f7a51575924539530c07253a2522d79a598075322;;;Should I go back to meds?;;;I was diagnosed 3 years ago (I was in high school). They tried me out on ritalin(horrible reaction), concerta(just as bad), but the one that worked the best was adderall. The thing is, when I was on it, I felt uncomfortable all the time. I went from weighing 130 pounds to 115 pounds within a few weeks. I'm not in college now, I have a job in sales. but I feel getting back the meds will help my job performance. is it worth it?
