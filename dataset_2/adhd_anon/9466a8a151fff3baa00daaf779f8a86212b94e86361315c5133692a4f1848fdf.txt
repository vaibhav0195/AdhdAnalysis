I have my assessment for ADHD tomorrow, as I'm not yet diagnosed, and they do screen for things like autism at the same time as well. I do know the symptoms of autism well, but I just don't know if ADHD negates any autistic traits, as some traits in the two disorders are quite contrasting/ conflicting. Like I am very talkative and outgoing, which I would say is an ADHD thing, as I get side tracked and end up rambling, but with autism, from what I can tell, you are less inclined to speak and be overwhelming. There are several others I can think of, such as with ADHD you often change your interests frequently, but with autism, again, from what I can tell, you have a long sustained interest.   So what traits do people with ASD and ADHD have, which a person with only one of said disorders wouldn't have?  *Also, a question which doesn't really suit this sub, but someone might know, so might as well ask. Does high functioning autism refer to the intellectual ability of the person, or the severity of the autism (like it doesn't cause them as many problems)?*
