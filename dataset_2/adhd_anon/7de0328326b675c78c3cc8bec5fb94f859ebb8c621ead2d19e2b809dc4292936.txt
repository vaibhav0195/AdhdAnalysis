Im a guy at 21 years, I got my diagnos 5 years ago and every medicine I've tried gave me mood-swings.  I got bipolar from the medicines aswell so Im struggling with being deppresive aswell :/ do someone know how I should handle this?  I would love all the help I could get.  I'm having a hard time talking with my doctors about this, and they still instist I should keep on with my treatment, I kept up for 1Â½ year with the medicines but I kept having mood-swings...
