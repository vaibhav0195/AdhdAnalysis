University, school or with doctor?;;;Does anyone have an opinion about where it is better to diagnose our 6 year old? We are in a small town but one with a major university which does diagnoses (but doesn't take insurance), through the school or with his pediatrician? Are any of these better than others? I searched the links on the side and actually asked all 3 places but none could (or would) share if there are any differences. His main problems are at home and he performs very high academically which is why I am hesitating to go through the school route. Would I get a more in-depth analysis through the university system? More advocates?
