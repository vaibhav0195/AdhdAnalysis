3b6fb62eb14fd5f12b3daa14bf5e4fcbaa5d3128f9600f233dff724130752ec1;;;I'm beginning to lose hope that I'll find the right medication;;;I'll try to keep this short and sweet, but as the title says I'm starting to lose hope. I've tried adderall, concerta, and now strattera. Thinking about asking my dr to try vyvanse because I've heard those who didn't have any luck in adderall had some luck with it but what if I never find a medication that works? Does that mean my diagnosis is incorrect? I guess I'm just frustrated that after a year of trying different meds at different doses I'm no better off than when I started.   Thanks for listening to my rant guys, I really do appreciate it.
