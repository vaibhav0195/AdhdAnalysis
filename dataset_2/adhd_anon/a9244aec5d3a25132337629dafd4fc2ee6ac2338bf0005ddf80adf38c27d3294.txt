I might have to, because they seem to think I am on drugs . . .;;;So I just started a new office job. Scheduling jobs and sending out bids. Pretty good job at a major telecom company.   I've been there for a month and they sat me down the other day to discuss :  1) late / time issues  2) I took 3 days sick (I know bad, only been there 1 months, but i hadn't slept at all and didn't feel safe driving on the icy roads on the highway with my brain being that impaired)  3) they have seen me and I quote "wandering around"  4) My manager casually mentioned if I had any physical or mental health problems, or need rehab for addiction. WTF. That's what got me worried, that they literally think I am on drugs!   I got some anxiety issues as well. So that's not to say I didn't contribute to this perception, but my self awareness really took a hit because I did not think it was nearly this bad.   I told them that I have an underlying condition, they did not as for specifics but I think for the sake of honesty I should tell them on Monday.   I just dont want to be high maintenance or get "special" privilege because I try to do my best without it. But obviously it's noticeable and its better I tell them that rather than have them think I am on drugs.
