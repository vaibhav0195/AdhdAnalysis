c4329cb01fece1bdb8b5b046784f4df80ab061c6df22a602fc4d9bca1b44816f;;;Diagnosed probably 10+ years ago, was medicated for awhile, but didn't like it.  College is getting hard, looking for some advice.;;;Basically when I was younger, got diagnosed, put on ritlin, had massive apatite loss, stopped taking it.  Went on focalin for a bit but after I got to college just stopped...  So, fast forward to today, I am a senior in college with reasonable grades, figured I might have overcome my adhd, but, after a random discussion with my mom, I reevaluated that statemet.   I am in one class this semester I am taking for the second time, the first time I audited it part way through so I can't measure my effort this time in any comparison, but I really am giving it all I got, and if the midterm is any indication that is not going to be enough.  My question is what should I be doing, if I don't pass this class, it will mess up everything bad enough I will probably drop out due to how things are scheduled and how I can't afford to stay for how this would impact things.  I could probably get another prescription from my doc but would that really do me any good without more time to see if it still even works on me?  The class is a proof based class, so it goes beyond memorization and more into getting into the frame of mind which is really difficult for me (hence the second time).  The idea of having to drop out because of one class has me more terrified than anything I have ever had to deal with before (i have a pretty nice life up till now I guess) and need every edge I can get to help me get through this final.  Any advice on this matter is welcome, I just don't know what I should do.  I have been putting in more man hours on this class than anything else in my college career and all I have to show for it is 7 more points on my midterm exam than I got last year.   tl;dr:been trying to manage adhd on my own the last few years, thinking it might not be enough,  What do?
