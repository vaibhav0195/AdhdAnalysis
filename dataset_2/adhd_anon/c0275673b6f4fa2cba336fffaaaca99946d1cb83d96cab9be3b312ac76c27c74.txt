c0275673b6f4fa2cba336fffaaaca99946d1cb83d96cab9be3b312ac76c27c74;;;Went to my medication dr/therpist, no meds :( (rant kinda);;;So he thinks this is just a phase of hypo-mania and thats why I'm so happy and shit all of a sudden now that I am off the effexor. The effexor made me pissed as all hell. I kept trying to tell him that this was the way I was as a teen, he kept asking me all the questions like he was trying to diagnose me with bipolar. I'm just like, no, no, no, no, to basically all of his questions. I'm just over active, but unmotivated, constantly bored, but do everything there is to do in the house, I can't sleep, I can't sit still, etc etc.  Then he asks the same questions, do you spend all your money? DO you give things away? blah blah blah.  He really will not give me a stimulant unless I am in college classes. This doesn't help with my now, I don't want my depression and anxiety to come back. I'm finally doing better and I don't want to spiral back down into that hole again.  I'm just kinda lost and need to throw all this out there, sorry. Any advice, I am already going to talk to my counselor about seeing the other Dr in the building, or have her talk to him because she totally gets where I am coming from.
