A few months ago, I was diagnosed with ADD @ 23 y/o [went in suspecting depression and anxiety after many, many years of feeling it; turns out untreated ADD causes a whole suite of issues]  2. Stumbling across coffee, I fell in love with it and began drinking regularly 5+ years ago. It became a culinary sort of pursuit for me, spending lots of time experimenting with brew methods and delving into home roasting!  3. Doctor put me on Ritalin IR, which has helped immensely, but I really miss my coffee. For the time being I have temporarily resorted to roasting my own decaf coffee - but I would love to be able to add back traditional, 'unmolested' coffee - as there's a lot more variety out there.  [note: don't know if it's a placebo effect, but after being off caffeinated coffee for months and having a standard cup, I realize I'm way more anxious and prone to negative thoughts. I don't know if it's a timing thing with the coffee too, or perhaps the amount I'm having (330ml)]  TL;DR - A serious coffee enthusiast that recently got diagnosed with Adult ADD, now on Ritalin. Doctor says Ritalin doesn't play well with coffee (it seems to cancel effects) - what options do I have? Want to heal my ADD, but finding it hard to give up on the traditional coffees (temporarily on decaf).
