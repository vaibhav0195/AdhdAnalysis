After getting diagnosed/medicated (and working my ass off) I achieved a 3.7 this semester and got my scholarship back!  Taking good notes saved my life. I attribute this to use of colored pens. It seems childish, but when I color coded important things in my notes it kept me engaged in the class, gave me better handwriting and I retained more information.  I just wanted to give a thank you to the community for your constant words of encouragement.  Good luck to everyone at university still finishing up their finals!
