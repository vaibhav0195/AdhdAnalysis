I still think I do. I have all the symptoms of it and I've been this way my entire life. This year I started taking birth control pills and I noticed my focus change. I no longer get distracted by every tiny thing. I can sit down and get work done that I planned to get done. I'm wondering if this has ever happened to anyone before? For me, I think a big part of it was that my hormones were always elevated so I was more distracted by how I was feeling and thats why I couldn't focus on anything. Birth control stabilized my hormones and I feel a lot more balanced. I also used to be hypersexual, now I think I'm at a much more normal level.   I realized this when I had to stop the BC for a week and I got back to the days of distractions and I also had 2 days where I just didn't get out of bed for class and sat there being lazy. It was horrible.  I'd just like some feedback. I'm trying to figure out if this is a real thing or if I'm just letting myself think the BC has this much of an effect. It could very well be me trying much harder this year to force myself to study and finish assignments and the influcence of my boyfriend who I want to make happy. But I can't help but feel the BC has a big part in it.  Thoughts? Has anyone else experienced this?
