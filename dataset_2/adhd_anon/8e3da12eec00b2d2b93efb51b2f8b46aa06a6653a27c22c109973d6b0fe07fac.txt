What should I be looking for?;;;Mom's a wreck, but I grew up with the ADHD and know meds can save a life of hardship (ritalin 2nd to 9th grade).  Since I have no adderall experience, I've come seeking advice from the folks who have.  I think the benefits will be easy to spot (homework done in less than 4 hours and such), but what negative side effects should we be on the lookout for after he starts?  What discussions should I be ready to have?  What advise can you give?  And thanks-- I really dig stalking this sub.  Note: He is excited to try the meds; he's absolutely exhausted by his ADHD and he was extremely relieved when he was diagnosed and began to understand there was a reason he was the way he was.
