I am 42 years old an just diagnosed(epicrisis is not ready) I am on my 4th or 5th week on Ritalin. Started out with 10mg daily and now on 40mg daily.    Often I have these moments where memories and things from the past pops up and it is  clearer than before and it feels like I can make better sense of it all. I could try to give some concrete examples, but I feel like it have to wait for now. It is overwhelming, but not in a negative way. There is just so much.  Not sure if anyone understood this, but can this be an effect of stimulants like Ritalin?
