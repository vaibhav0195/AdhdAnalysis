6bcf2552374f51236a76f27d58e3e1d5a7fa5f215727090763c3f74a26fa92d7;;;what to do? take a break from school and start again in spring semester?;;;hello r/ADHD, i just find out my psychiatrist that i been seeing since i was diagnosed at an age of 9, couldn't refill my med because i am too old and belong to her dept.Here is the problem,i am starting class with old amphetamine pill and no psychiatrists to see and refills. i am currently taking one class due to the Fs i got from failing all the class i took last semester.This is the class i cant afford to fail,i am retaking this class to cover the F i have on that class. I already miss some class due to financial conflict with school.  WHAT i am trying to do right now ? look for a new doctor and have  he /she refer me to a new psychiatrist WHILE class is starting.  I have a few choices i can make to pull through this semester:  1.DROP the class and take the same class on Saturday instead, so that i wont be behind on that class too much.  2.DROP my class and start again next semester when i am have my med.  3.STICK with my class, focus most of my time on it and quit one of my jobs and go see therapy provided by the school while looking for a doctor   TL;DR Should i just drop my classes because i don't have the med nor the psychiatrist or just take it on Saturday instead without med?
