c5dad515099b53f4db2ecba2f85d2228aedb11366876e180f0018b657fa2854e;;;Need some help on a topic that has been laying idle ever since I was diagnosed;;;So I'm fairly young, only 14y/o. Ever since I realized I had a problem with my everyday life I went straight to a reddit sub asking for some advice, I asked why I had such a struggle getting my school or chores etc done or what usually happens, starting those responsibilities. After I explained myself they said I could have ADD/ADHD, now I've heard of these disorders but honestly didn't know what they actually where. I looked them up and started connecting the dots from all my years at school and which lead up to me getting pulled out of school for homeschooling this year.  So fast forward to here, now I've been diagnosed for a few months with an attention deficit disorder. Things have been alright but I still feel like a fraud, like I'm just lazy and want to get my responsibilities done with little effort and let the drug do the work. Yet at the same time I really don't feel like a fraud, I just have no proof that I have a problem because nobody without the disorder has walked in my shoes.   How do you all overcome this, that you actually do have a disorder but can't explain to anyone how it is living with it? I think that's the reason I feel like a fraud because I can't prove anyone wrong when they just call me lazy or just want an edge over someone who doesn't take a stimulant. I do know that I have a problem but just can't describe it or give proof, and when I can't do that I feel guilty.
