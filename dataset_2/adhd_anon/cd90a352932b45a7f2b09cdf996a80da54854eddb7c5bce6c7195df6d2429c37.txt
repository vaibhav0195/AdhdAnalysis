This will be my first semester where I'm finally diagnosed with ADHD and on medication.  Here is a list of what I have or am going to buy.  I'd like to know if any of you have any suggestions to help make my life easier.    What I need or already have:  * Planner (agenda) with months/weeks/days and a section for notes. (This really helped me during my last semester) * pens/pencils * Backpack * ruler * paper * Individual 1/2 inch binders (because I'm not doing just one big binder ever again) * Highlighters * Graphing calculator (I am still on the fence with this one but I know they last forever) * my laptop that can record lectures while I take notes * Stapler * hole punch  Is there anything else I could use?  What item has made your schooling easier?    Edit: If it makes a difference, here are the classes I'm taking:  * English 102 * Psychology 210 * Biology 101 * Math 100
