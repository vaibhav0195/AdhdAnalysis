I have been thinking about what went differently in the past, and brainstorming ideas for new things to try.   I believe a crucial element to success is working with other people. I do my best work when I am surrounded by other people who are working, such as in a library, or gathering with other job-hunting friends.   But that's not enough this time; I need to do something fundamentally different from (or in addition to) what I have been doing.  I am looking to expand this social accountability system, and connect specifically with other people with ADHD.  Who else would like to partake in this?   *I am imagining that the group could do things like hold a weekly competition for whoever submits the most number of applications, etc., and finds a way to reward that person.   *Another idea would be to have a "skirmish," modeled after the skirmishes seem on FAWM.org (February album writing month). A date and time is set in advance, then one person gives everyone else a song title at the appointed time, and everyone has one hour to write and post their song. What if we did something like that (but gave it more time), and make it focused on themes like a cover letter, for example?  *I also know how it feels to be stuck or overwhelmed when tasked to write about yourself, so perhaps we could help each other with that too - For example, I have an easier time with it if I speak out loud with someone about my qualifications first.  Please let me know if you're interested, and/or have any ideas for how to refine this idea. Thanks.  **TL;DR: Looking for other people with ADHD who are job-hunting to form an online group.**
