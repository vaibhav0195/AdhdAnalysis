This semester I'm taking a required, 8-week English course in which we are required to read 5 novels. The reading assignments end up being about 50 pages per day. Yesterday was the first time in my life that I was able to read that much in one sitting, and I was so proud. However, today I realized that I only absorbed about 5% of it.   I've always had poor reading comprehension of lengthy content, but in every other class I've always found other ways to learn the material. I don't know what to do in this class because the only way to learn the material is done so in a way that I cannot.   Help??
