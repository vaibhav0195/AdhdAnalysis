(Super long, sorry in advance);;;I'm sorry in advance for this post being all over the place, I'm just not sure what the issue is here.  Last November I finally decided to act on what I suspected to be ADHD after 19 years of assuming everyone struggled like this. I went to the open clinic that Henry Ford holds in some offices, and met with a doctor who had a hard enough time speaking English, and apparently a harder time properly diagnosing patients.  She gave me 30 days worth of 10mg Adderall, after a few very basic questions. I've been reading that most stimulants warrant an EKG test beforehand, which she definitely did not do. She said if 10mg didn't seem to do the trick to call her and then start taking two 10mg tablets, twice daily.  After about a week and a half of 20mg twice daily I had gotten frustrated enough with no signs of improvement to call back and continue looking for a solution. You all don't need to hear about how hard it was to contact her, but I ended up explaining everything that had happened so far to one of her colleagues. Ultimately, I made it pretty clear that 20mg was not accomplishing what I had hoped. Instead of increasing the dosage or changing the med entirely, she prescribed 20mg (not 10mg x 2), to be taken twice daily. Essentially the exact same thing that I had been taking.  Obviously this seemed pointless and she confirmed that they were identical dosages over the phone, and she clearly did not understand my problem. Since I got the script filled I've been taking 40mg (20mg x 2) twice daily. It's been working wonders, with the usual side effects everyone else seems to be showing. Now that my schedule is different and I think XR would work better for me than the IR I've been using, the doctors from the clinic are appalled that I've been taking 40mg and say that it will be very difficult to switch to XR.  I know this was a lot but I'm just confused. Was it wrong of me to take 40mg instead because of the pointless "new" script? I'm not even sure what my actual question is, I just want confirmation that I haven't destroyed my body or something by doing this. And maybe advice in general I suppose.   tl;dr: No results after 2x10mg twice daily. Dr prescribed one 20mg twice daily, but I've been taking 2x20mg twice a day. Bad or not..?
