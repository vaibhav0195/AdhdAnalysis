I've been diagnosed with ADHD  last year and I was on Concerta  for a few months, but for the past 6 months I had any due to insurance problems. The medication has helped me so much in completing school work and staying organized. The past 6 months I have been a mess and struggling to finish school. I talked to my dad about going to the doctor to get more medication but he doesn't think I need it. He just thinks I'm a lazy high school kid. ADHD has seriously affected my life. I've tried meditation and binaural beats to help with it but have been unsuccessful. I don't know how to explain it to him. Any tips?
