Missing something?;;;**Background:** was diagnosed ADHD at about 14, on Ritalin off and on into university. It certainly helped, but I wasn't sold on the whole ADHD thing, was often fairly ok without meds, and hated the feeling of taking it every day.   Finally went back to a doc a few months ago after a year of misery (change in life situation, focus going away completely, starting to get pretty damn low with professional life going down the toilet), got a diagnosis as an adult (29 now) and, it really hit me when my doc said, "ADHD doesn't come and go, just your life circumstances and ability to deal with it gets better and worse".   **Now:** So, we've been trying to figure out a medication strategy that's more sustainable long term. Started on Strattera and it was like a miracle on day 1. Motivation was suddenly there and I was starting to catch up on things. Some side effects but nothing bad.   On day 5 I realized brand names weren't covered by my insurance, so I asked for a switch to his other non-stimulant suggestion that had a generic, Wellbutrin. A week of that and I gave up because even though I know it could work in 2-4 weeks, patience is not my strong suit. $200/mo for Strattera suddenly seemed trivial for my sanity :P  Fast forward to a month on the full 80mg dose, and it felt like it had gradually completely stopped working, and the daily hour or two of nausea and intensified menstrual cramps really didn't seem worth it. Doc said that wasn't terribly uncommon and we decided it's stimulant time.  I've been working up to 2 x 20mg generic Adderall IR. Day 1 &amp; 2 were amazing. Then gradually less so. It started to feel like something big was missing again.   **Strattera == driver behind the wheel, but no engine**  **Adderall == engine in the car, but no one behind the wheel**  I know if I ask him about changing anything now, he'll want me to stick out the month to give it a fair shot, and that seems entirely reasonable. I have plenty extra of both Strattera and Wellbutrin and it's taking all my willpower to not just start taking one of them, because I want to feel. better. now. dammit!  I can't help but think that the initial days on the Adderall were so much better because the Strattera takes a while to get out of your system, so I had both going at first. My doc was fine with trying them together, but I had felt that the Strattera wasn't doing anything anymore, so he said to just scrap it. Plus I'd probably try the Wellbutrin again instead for the cost and hopefully less nausea. With the Adderall at least *helping* in the meantime, it would be easier to wait it out. With just the Adderall, focus is improved when I can get going on something, but I'm missing the lack of resistance to starting things that I had previously.  I'm not sure exactly why I'm posting here other than for support, any advice or common experiences, and a bit of venting :)   As someone who approaches things in life with research, logic, and confidence, it's so frustrating to play the experimentation and waiting game!
