63caf22dbf17e1ee189ecafdc071caf01a174b9bd49b5d59fe27b4cc7d7d42df;;;r/ADHD just changed my life;;;This is the very first place I've ever been able to connect with people that I KNOW are like me. overly aggressive body language, difficulty maintaining eye contact and this missing "link that everyone else had". Its like finding all the little questions you never had the answer to in life and words can't even describe to know how good it feels to finally hear/see stories i can actually connect too. people always say they have adhd but i feel are not like me or sty least heavily show symptoms like me idk. I ALWAYS overthink personal posts and delete them. hope this doesn't get deleted hii r/adhd
