f5daa2124ed94fe85222b67e3e3c5efaaa4723f50d6f748131368dd5deba0db8;;;Suffering from ADHD and Anxiety, and would like to know how others are handling it.;;;I spoke to a "counselor" (I say this because we aren't charged, but they all have degrees in psychology and can prescribe medication) on campus and she told me that I have mild social anxiety and mild ADHD also. So my question is have any of you found a successful medication or form of therapy that helps you get important things, like assignments, finished on time? I've been struggling to focus for more than 40 minutes at a time.   I will note I can't do stimulants like Ritalin and Adderall(sp?) they increase my heart rate too much and then I become a nervous emotional wreck.  I've set up a calendar to help me remember important dates, and I set up a daily schedule for a while but things never happened as they were suppose to and so that stopped working.  More information about me: Female, 21, second year of college. I rarely drink alcohol, limit my caffeine intake and can't eat dairy/gluten due to dietary intolerance. I don't eat much sugar it dyes unless I have a massive craving for sweets (usually dark chocolate or coconut ice cream).  Any advice or articles that can help would be much appreciated!    Edit: made paragraph breaks more apparent and easy to see.
