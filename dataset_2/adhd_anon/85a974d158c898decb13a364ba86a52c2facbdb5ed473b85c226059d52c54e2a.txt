I was diagnosed with adhd, anxiety and depression. Concerta/ritalin definitely has been overall good in terms of school, but i've noticed my anxiety and depressive symptoms seem to be heightening and occurring more often.  I have addressed this with both my psychiatrist and therapist. My psychiatrist thinks i need more CBT. My therapist agrees that my anxiety and depression are worse after starting my meds, but stressed meds help with functionality (which i acknowledge) but that doesn't stop unaddressed issues from still affecting my moods.  I'm not looking for a shortcut. i've come so far from where i was when i initially sought therapy (adhd was not even a consideration at the time), but i don't know whether i should push for switching my adhd med or possible adding an antidepressant or anti-anxiety med or just give it more time.   for what it's worth, i was initially treated for depression with wellbutrin for five months which had no effect. i've been in talk therapy for 1.5 years and on concerta for one year.
