So it looks like I might be going on meds at some point over the next year or so.  I'm interested in being as little affected by meds as possible, and really want as few effects as possible other than managing the ADHD symptoms.  I'm also going to see if there are medications I can take for work days only, rather than 100% of the time.  I want to know what kind of effects ADHD meds have on you other than managing symtpoms.  How do they make you feel on a day-to-day basis, do they have any physical feelings or body-load etc etc.  How do they affect your mood, your thoughts, and your physical feelings at the time?  How do the different medications affect you differently?  **TL;DR**:  I'm probably going to get a diagnosis soon and am wondering what I can expect from the meds, other than (hopefully) helping my ADHD symptoms
