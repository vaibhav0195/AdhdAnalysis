I was recently denied government aid through healthcare.gov and would have to pay $200 a month for health care when I can barely afford the food to feed myself.   Last year I started to think that maybe my academic failure wasn't because I was simply stupid or lazy but because something was interfering. No matter how hard I tried, no matter how smart every one of my peers, teachers, and superiors thought I was, I always did mediocrely. This continues to today. I won't list my symptoms here because I believe they all fit the bill. I can't meditate, and I can't create proper habits in my life. No matter how hard I try because life is so stressful and jam-packed I end up reverting back to my old habits of losing my car keys, fidgeting, procrastinating, cutting people off mid-sentence. etc etc. When I take quizzes online (I know, they aren't a diagnosis.) I have gotten positive results on 100% of the 10+ quizzes I have taken.  My question is what can I do that is affordable, and what can I do to get help and a diagnosis in central Texas at the age of 22 as a university student to hopefully correct myself so I may get my school and life back on track?
