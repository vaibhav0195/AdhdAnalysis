ec0e03b3cbace999904e4aa91cec8628a92013b5f7f143b9495e1d775166f816;;;Driven by distraction;;;I am in chicago working at a convention this week. I lay out daily publications and crank out editorial designs all day. Normally the staff I work on is secluded from everyone. Sure we have to dress up for the occasion but we usually get dumped in a basement room and have zero distractions until the end of the day when the client come int to check off page. This show I am in a triple sized cube, no ceiling, hot air. I can hear everything going on around me. Phones chirping, people eating, people talking. To make it worse the client we are working for is in the room. So we are facing each other and it is awkward. When we share a room with the client, headphones are forbidden. I need to block out this noise in order to focus.
