5a0c85e644eb229c591d2a7e59fb53555791b4a90cf2700bcaf1b416180a94ce;;;I have my first psychologist appointment today. Im so nervous..;;;im 27. mother has "type 6 ring of fire" adhd along with cousins and my 5 year old son. I got diagnosed with adhd when I was 8 but my mom being who she is and going unmedicated herself, I went on with zero treatment. I ended up pregnant at 17 and failed school (I graduated but just barely). I didnt start really researching or caring about it until this past year. Im terrified of being diagnosed though I know I need this. Im terrified of talking to a stranger about how much Im a failure.  Im terrified of being on any kind of mind altering drug although I smoke weed. Im just terrified with no valid reason to be. What do I say to her? Is it just q&amp;a? Will I be diagnosed right away or does it take multiple sessions? I have major social anxieties so the thought of sitting there with a stranger alone can make me pee a little. Tell me ill be fine.. please?
