I am a graduate student and only have the ability to get on campus health insurance, so an outside provider isn't an option.  What they have made me do:   1. Prove I had a diagnosis from an outside hospital.    2. Filled out a questionnaire, which was targeted to be used as a psudeo-diagnosis.  It asked questions like between the ages of 5 and 12 did you have trouble following instructions, ect.   3. They are going to mail that same questionare to my mother and have her fill it out. It could be anyone from your childhood, but they had to know you then.   4. The nurse told me I had to get a drug test, which I was fine with even though I had to pay for it out of pocket because it was a third party. I wasn't okay with it being  **an observed drug test**. I will get into how this made me feel in a little bit.   5. Meet with a doctor and go over this stuff. (I have this appointment Friday)   6. Get meds? It is really unclear to me when that will happen   I just really am curious as to what other universities do because I feel like this is an undue burden to care and an invasion of my privacy in the name of preventing abuse of adderol by students.  **It wasn't a nurse that was in the room with me**, it was some person who worked at this troubled youth and family center the test was at.  My last university didn't make me do this, and I was just getting diagnosed then. I have been diagnosed for a number of years now, and I figured this would be easy because I'm not just trying now to get diagnosed. This still wouldn't be okay even if I was a new diagnosis.  **TL;DR**  **University made me get an observed drug test before they will consider prescribing me standard ADHD medication. I am hoping for others who have gone through this process at their universities will share their stories to help me get a sense of how normal or abnormal mine is.**  Thank you all!
