Dextro-amphetamines don't really do much for me and Strattera is okay. Although I've been reading about dextro-methylphenidate for a while now and it might be the solution to my medication problem. The problem that I face right now is that I can't seem to get it in the Netherlands. It is not illegal, but it's just not (widely available) on the market. Although it isn't in our national database of medications. I've read that some pharmacies in the Netherlands make a generic of it, but all of those are unnamed in the reviews/blog posts I read and I can't seem to retrieve them through there either. My psychiatrist hasn't heard of it either, but he is willing to consider it. Now it would be nice if we can actually find a pharmacist in the Netherlands. So my question is does anyone know of such a pharmacist in the Netherlands. Or possibly another way to get it here?  ~Yami_Bas
