The problem is I've never been formally diagnosed with ADHD, I've only been told by my two close friends that it's highly likely I have ADHD, and that I should talk to a doctor about it. The citalopram has made me a far more outgoing person but without my anxiety it feels like I've lost some impulse control. Basically I guess I'm wondering if anyone else has other similar experiences, or if this just means my antidepressant isn't quite the right one?
