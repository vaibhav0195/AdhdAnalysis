I was diagnosed at with ADHD at 20, and it still took a few months before I was tried on stimulants. The doctor wanted to try absolutely everything else first (which is fine with me). I was put on Adderall XR over a year ago (August 2013), and it worked wonders for me. I have tried others because the XR gave me horrible side effects, and now I'm on 20mg IR 3x a day (but I usually only take 2x daily), and it is fantastic.  I'm finally able to get more stuff done, I'm able to be productive. It feels really good to actually start/finish something before the night before it's due! It's amazing!  However, just about anybody that knows that I have ADHD and that I take medication for it believe that it's just the medication that's doing all of this. The one that hurts the most, is my mom. Anytime that I get a lot of work done, or something along those lines, or I have a night aide at work that requires me to be awake from 11p-7a, she always attributes it to my medication! My mom and I have a GREAT relationship, but it kills me whenever she says this.  I'll wake up for class at 7am on a Friday, go to class, homework, and hang out until about 10.30, then leave for work. I space my pills out a little, so that I can take one later at night, so that I can focus for work. But when I tell my mom about it later the next day (on the phone, I'm away at school), she says that, **"It must help to be on medication that keeps you awake."** EXCUSE ME?!?!???!  Whenever I do housework when I go home, it's attributed to my Adderall helping me or making me do it. No, it's not. My Adderall helps me function and to actually apply myself the way that others apply themselves, so why is it seen that it's ONLY the medication that works??  During group projects at school? Oh, Quixotic can do it. He's on Adderall so he can stay up all night and nothing will phase him. NO! My medication helps keep me calm, it DOES NOT affect me like it affects others without ADHD.  People will come up and ask me if they can buy some of it off of me. Excuse me, are you stupid?? No. I'm not selling my medication that helps me. It's illegal, and it ALMOST brings me to the level of functioning that you have on a regular day.  My girlfriend understands (well, at least as well as she can), so why can't my mom? Why can't others? I love my mom, we've always been close, but this absolutely kills me.  It's me whose doing all of this! Not my medication!  **TL;DR** Just about everybody attributes my getting stuff done to my medication.
