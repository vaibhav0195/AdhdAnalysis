Thats my second favourite movie sci-fi movie, my favourite being starwars.  I remember when I first saw starwars and we found out dv was lukes father :O I was so amazed. Or when dv killed the emperor aka space Hitler  Wasn't there that one doctor who episode with Hitler in it? That was the 11th doctor. He was a bit to fairytaleish for me. I LOVED the tenth though, he died from radiation.  Nuclear bombs are crazy. I love explosions, isn't weird that rockets are propelled by explosions?  Space is awesome... What was I doing? Hmmm ok backtracking, bombs.... Starwars... Oh hitchhikers guide to the galaxy! I loved their joke about towels, what can towels really do?   And that is why I made this http://imgur.com/FzK3gA1 (towel monkey) and didn't complete my homework...   Fuck
