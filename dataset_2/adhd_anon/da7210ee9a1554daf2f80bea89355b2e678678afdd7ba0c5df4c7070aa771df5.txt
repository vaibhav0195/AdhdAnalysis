da7210ee9a1554daf2f80bea89355b2e678678afdd7ba0c5df4c7070aa771df5;;;Started a new 8:30 to 5:30 job. How in the seven hells do you get started in the morning?;;;Was diagnosed with inattentive type ADHD in Januay, and they just put me on Straterra a week ago. Can't say it's working because I still forgot to brush my teeth and empty he litter box this morning, but at least it no longer makes me feel like a zombie.  Going from an 11am to 7pm job to a job where I need to be up at 6:45am to be there at 8:30 is....well, a hot mess. And it isn't even adjusting to a new sleep schedule.  My boyfriend is an EMT and regularly gets up at 4 to be at work at 5:30am. His advice was to make ready EVERYTHING you need for the day before and stick it in a place where you know you'll see it. Problem is, my mind goes into hyper drive in the early morning. Things get done as I remember them and I often forget to brush my teeth or I leave lunch sitting on the counter.  I'll make a plan on the way home - undress, feed cat and rats, empty litter box, prepare dinner and lunch, shower, video games for a few hours, set out clothes for tomorrow, bed.   Now imagine all those steps reversing and stopping at feeding the pets, showering, remembering you still have chicken in the fridge, starting a match on Overwatch and forgetting you haven't had dinner. Oh, and you forgot to empty the litter box AGAIN.  How the hell do you manage all this before the meds kick in?
