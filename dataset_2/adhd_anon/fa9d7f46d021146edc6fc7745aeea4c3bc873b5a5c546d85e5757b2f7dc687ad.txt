I am so upset now.;;;I have been on Dextroamphetamine Spansules for 6 weeks now and it actually started working. I was so happy and relieved!  My sugar cravings were cut back significantly, easier time regulating my emotions, not self medicating with food anymore, focus was a bit better (still not great, though.) Working memory was only slightly improved. It was likely that i needed one more increase in dosage and was going to discuss this with my psychiatrist at my next appointment.  Well that increase won't be happening now. The tachycardia that was the reason I had to quit a number of the other drugs I have tried  showed up. I am so upset right now, can't stop crying.   Intuniv and Focalin are the only two I have not tried. Focalin is off the table due to the tachycardia/high blood pressure i had with other methylphenidate based drugs.  Coaching and CBT are fails for me as well. Intuniv is now my last resort. If it does not work, I don't know what I will do.    TL;DR: Dextroamphetamine started working (YAY!), but tachycardia strikes again (FUCKFUCKFUCKFUCK!), Intuniv only drug left to try. Coaching failed, CBT failed. Probably fucked for life, crying eyes out.  .  .  Drug list (only want to type this once...)  Wellbutrin: made ADHD worse, not great for depression either.  Ritalin: High blood pressure, slightly effective  Strattera: Tachycardia (given lopressor to combat that. resting heart rate went from 125 to 90ish), some effect but eventually nothing except sugar cravings gone.  Vyvanse:  No side effects. very slight response for first three days, then fuck all for six weeks.  Dextroamphetamine Spansules: Tachycardia, but was starting to work.  Concerta: Tachycardia, did sweet fuck all.
