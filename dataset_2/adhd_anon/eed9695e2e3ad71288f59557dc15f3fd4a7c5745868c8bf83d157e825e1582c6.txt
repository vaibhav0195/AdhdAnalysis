I've written half of the intro to my three page paper and can't seem to keep going. It took me about 3 hours to get this far.  I want to do something else. ANYthing else, right now. Math homework sounds fucking great but as soon as I try to start doing it instead I'll flake and have the same issue three problems in.  Just whining :(
