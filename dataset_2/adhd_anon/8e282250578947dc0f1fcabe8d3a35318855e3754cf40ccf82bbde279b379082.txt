I haven't taken them later than 3 pm. My normal "bdetime" is 2-3 am. I've had insomnia type symptoms for the last 3 nights, and my stomach has been upset, even almost thought I would throw up while eating lunch a couple times. Didn't. But anyway, will the sleeping issues get at least a little better on their own? and should I be worried about chest discomfort or like shortness of breath? It could be like acid reflux maybe, also I might be a little low on blood sugar because it's quite hard for me to eat. And the last 2 days the positive mental effects of the meds have dulled a whole lot. Just looking for some advice, I feel quite shitty right now physically..   edit: should I maybe take a break tomorrow? or power through the beginning of medicating oh also, I hate the constant feeling of needing to burp, it's really uncomfortable and will that maybe stop?
