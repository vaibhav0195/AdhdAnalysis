I'm a university student, and I've noticed that the quality of my focus on my homework really increases when I'm sitting in positions people would consider weird... even now that I'm 22. Sorry if this is a silly question, but I'm just curious.   Examples would be sitting cross-legged like you would if you were sitting on the floor, or with one leg propped up on the seat and resting your chin on it, or having one leg tucked under yourself so you're basically sitting on your foot.  I've been doing this since I was a child, and I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was about 5 years old. I try not to do it in public, but sometimes I'll stop caring if I'm under a lot of stress and *really* need to focus and get my work done at some place like the library.   I know that this is mostly associated with other kinds of disorders like ones on the autism spectrum, but I also know that stimming, or stim-like motions are used by people with ADHD too, but more for focusing and getting that need for movement out of our system moreso than for self-soothing in potentially stressful situations or to handle intense emotions. I've been tested for autism before when I was a kid, but I didn't have behaviors outside of some of the shared ones between ADHD and autism spectrum disorders consistent enough with the criteria to get any sort of diagnosis of, so I'm pretty sure that isn't a factor.  So I was wondering if maybe this was something other people with ADHD experience as being helpful and see if people have any thoughts as to why this might be if they do... or if this is just a thing I do that a lot of people would see as odd and is probably unrelated to me having ADHD.
