b2a8b5416fbe37d8dde01399341bf8513104864e1d17983747ed1f53bf12dd60;;;Dammit I fucked up the bills again!;;;I have two checking accounts - I opened a second one to transfer all of the money for bills to so I can just forget about it because who actually keeps track of anything but the account balance these days? And because my husband &amp; I were spending, and kept going into the bill money (sigh) by accident and when the auto-payment went through we'd be in trouble. (We'd transfer over from savings to cover it. This was bad for our savings, which now no longer exists due to previous car repairs.)  So anyway, we set that up and it's great, except for I keep forgetting to transfer the fucking funds on time. And THEN when I did... I transferred $40 short, causing me to overdraft again. So this time I'm getting hit with probably 3 overdraft charges, despite having all the money already in the primary account.  This is the second... third? time this has happened this year and it's SO frustrating. My bank's charges are only $25 (I &lt;3 my bank!) but two from them + one from my cellular provider (since it's likely to get sent back, and then I'm going to have to pay them a fee AND it's gonna be late, ugh) - at least my power bill went through successfully this time because they were really angsty about it last time.  **Edit:** Oh, I forgot to add what I was going to do about this! Durrrrr.  I'm about to set up an automatic transfer for payday to transfer the budgeted amounts over. And if for some reason payday is gonna come late then I think I can edit that transfer for that one time. I hope.
b2a8b5416fbe37d8dde01399341bf8513104864e1d17983747ed1f53bf12dd60;;;Workplace awkwardness;;;So, yesterday at work I met another new cashier. She got hired at around the same time I did. She's pregnant &amp; seemed really cool. We chatted while doing some of the online training courses. Today we were trying to do more training courses and needed to watch a video, but the speaker within the CPU was too low.  So I tried to find a setting that might help by directing her to the advanced menu. I thought there might have been a master volume limit - there wasn't. In hindsight, she was probably annoyed with that. I should have just let her do it since it was her terminal we were going to watch it at, but I didn't. Anyway, after that, I saw some computer speakers and I said, "Oh, pause it!" and she said, "Please." That took me by surprise. I apologized a couple of times and said that I wasn't intending to be rude... I felt so awful.  Anyway, so I had handed her one end of the speaker cord because I thought it was long enough to reach, but it was twisted up so we had to untwist it. So, naturally, I started to try to untwist it - she seemed to be helping by pulling the end through the loops as I was opening them. Apparently I misread that situation as well because she laughed and said, "You're funny." I had no idea what the hell she was talking about - what'd I do? So I just said, "Huh?" and continued trying to untwist the cable. She said that she was "fully capable of handling it - I'm making a whole *person*." I think I apologized again, saying I was just trying to help, but at that point I'm not even sure if I made words.  I felt so dejected. I suddenly realized that, despite my best intentions, I had come across as bossy, rude, and possibly controlling. Maybe I am all of those sometimes, but I try not to be most of the time. So I spent most of my shift reminding myself that I shouldn't be too friendly, or too helpful, or too comfortable at work. I also noted that I should be glad she spoke up, because I had no idea at all what her perspective was, and if I don't get feedback on the negatives, I can't fix them and turn them into positives.  So while I am in a way glad, I'm also frustrated that I made her uncomfortable, and I don't want to make my coworkers uncomfortable. Therefore, the rest of the shift, I made a conscious effort to focus solely on my job and my customers. Aside from asking questions, I refrained from conversation with coworkers. I mean, being a cashier doesn't really require teamwork or camaraderie. We're there to make money, not friends, &amp; hopefully by backing off a bit on the type A personality stuff, I'll be able to move around &amp; upward within the company more easily.  All of this doesn't mean that my feelings aren't still hurt, though. I feel like a puppy who's just been bopped on the nose for jumping one too many times, I guess.
b2a8b5416fbe37d8dde01399341bf8513104864e1d17983747ed1f53bf12dd60;;;Letter from my Psychologist to my Primary Doctor recommending re-evaluation of meds. Is it even worth bringing up his misconceptions at our next appointment?;;;My commentary will be &gt;quoted. CAPITALIZED STUFF changed for identification reasons. I'm sharing because I'm a little frustrated - he's inferred a lot from our whopping two sessions together and I already had to correct him on which branch of service my husband is in and my handedness. Overall I really like my psychologist, I know that he wants to help me, but is it at all worth bringing any of his misconceptions up? Most especially about my "average" school performance. I worked hard and had fun in school, I'm proud of my academic achievements and I've never been called average when it came to my performance in school before. It was the only thing I excelled at and I guess it hurts my feelings that he inferred I performed at an "average" capacity instead of asking if I did well. I thought I had said that I never had trouble in school, but I talked a whole hell of a lot, so maybe it got lost in translation.  **Background Information**  I initially saw Codi Pax on DATE in order to provide diagnostic formulation and treatment recommendations. Codi current resides with her husband. They have been married for the past 4 years. She has no children. She is employed as a HAPPY TREE IN A BOB ROSS PAINTING. Her husband serves in the MILITARY.  As a child, Codi stated she was fidgety, restless and she rocked back and forth and she got picked on at school because she did not wear the right clothes.  &gt;I did not exactly say this - I got picked on for my clothes one day out of one semester in high school, because I made my own wacky-tacky day, not really understand what spirit week was the previous semester. While I did wear hand-me-downs, I never really got picked on for my clothes except for that one time. Also, I still rock back and forth in the car, but he was not interested in hearing about my hyperactive tics as an adult, just as a child.  During her elementary school years, she was distractible [sic] and inattentive and she had difficulty in math. She was homeschooled from grade 6-8.  &gt;Not true - I did not have difficulty in math until High School. There's also no mention of me skipping 7th grade &amp; thus being the youngest in my entire high school when I went back. It probably wasn't really that important.  Thereafter, entered high school where she doodled in class, did not take notes and she was forgetful. Codi graduated from high school while enrolled in regular class. She was never retained and her academic grades were average. Subsequently, she obtained an Associate's Degree in ASDFJKL;.  &gt;Also false - many of my primary classes were College Prep and I did take an Advanced Prep class as well - he didn't ask though, &amp; I hadn't mentioned. Additionally, I didn't realize that it was average for students to be in the National Honors Society - I really did not have trouble in school. I loved it, I just sucked at algebra and had a higher than 3.5 GPA throughout both high school &amp; college. Although, yeah, it took me 7 semesters to get a 4 semester degree.  Codi reports no history of psychiatric hospitalizations. She was a psychologist age 16 [sic] and was diagnosed with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. She is currently treated with the psychiatric medication Concerta 27 Mg, 1 daily. She was previously treated with Ritalin &amp; Straterra. Codi denies any history of alcohol or illicit drug use. She reports no history of arrests or of criminal activities. Medically, she reports no history of strokes, seizures, head injuries or motor vehicle accidents. Additionally, she reports having difficulty sleeping, a poor appetite and difficulty completing tasks.  &gt;I didn't report a poor appetite, hahaha, I just have a shitty diet. I am eating a little in the morning, usually a Slim Fast shake because it's fast and easy &amp; I haven't got enough time to cook because I sleep in as late as I can because it takes me eons to fall asleep at night, but that makes my stomach queasy when I take Concerta because it isn't good solid food. I had explained that - I thought. -shrugs-  **Mental Status &amp; Behavioral Observations:**  Codi is a 5'7", overweight, left-handed, ambulatory female who is casually dressed and appropriately groomed. She is alert and oriented x 4. Eye contact was occasionally maintained. Speech is intelligible. She is distractible [sic], excessively talkative, restless and on edge and she fidgets and interrupts/intrudes on others. Affect is constricted and mood anxious. Her thought processes are logical and coherent. There are no overt signs of delusions, hallucinations, loose associations, phobias or obsessions. Current suicidal and homicidal thoughts, actions and plans were denied. Immediate memory is 3/3; recent is 3/3; remote is 4/4. Insight and judgment is intact. Overall, she was a reliable historian.  &gt;What does the x4 &amp; 3/3, 4/4 references mean? I'm going to ask my doctor when I see her today! And I'm surprised I'm a reliable historian. I am constantly forgetting whatever it was I was just talking about. Huh? :)  **Summary:**  Codi was given the diagnoses of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Combined Type &amp; Anxiety Disorder, NOS. Given that she continues to experience considerable difficulties on her current medication, a re-evaluation of the efficacy of her current medication is recommended. Furthermore, in light of her sleep difficulties, I would also recommend that she be evaluated for a sleep aid.

So, a couple of nights ago, my fears which I shared in [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/10ovvr/ive_made_two_big_mistakes_due_to_lack_of/) really culminated - I had made two relatively big mistakes in less than 30 days, of course within my 6-month probationary period at my new job as a cashier. I LOVE my job, but as my husband put it, *"When you have a bad day at work, you have a few bad days at home."*  This really concerned me - I know I have a [tendency to think catastrophically,](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/107xkl/im_learning_to_overcome_overthinking_what_ifs_id/) so I tried to think very realistically. Well, realistically, I could have been terminated; however, at worst, I'd be written up and moved to other duties for a while before being allowed to return to the register.  Today I was written up - it was a negative counseling - but we discussed my "problem" (my supervisor refrains from calling it a disorder, attention deficit, ADHD, or anything else - she calls it "the problem that you have" or "your problem") and how I could probably move to Hard Lines or Soft Lines if working a register continued to be an issue.  I also spoke with the Learning Facilitator today who also had ADHD, and who is also one of the Equal Employment Opportunity representatives (which I had forgotten about) and she suggested that I read ["You Mean I'm Not Lazy, Stupid or Crazy?!"](http://www.amazon.com/Stupid-Self-Help-Attention-Deficit-Disorder/dp/0684815311) - she's actually going to let me borrow it.  We also discussed my medication - I told her I was only taking it on work days and she highly suggested I take it daily so that my body stays acclimated to it and so I don't feel sick when I take it after a couple of days off in a row. (It does make me queasy when I don't eat enough before I take it.)  She also informed me that as long as I'm proactive and not *actively* doing anything to harm the company, I would be protected from being fired due to my ADHD. I am not sure how I feel about this - part of me wants to say it's not fair for them to not be able to fire someone who makes a lot of mistakes, but I also feel good about it, because I am already working on improving so that I don't make this mistakes... plus, I actually want to be there. I enjoy my job, and I'm good at it (when I'm not messing it up). So there's that.  Anyway, I wanted to share that. I was so immensely nervous about the discussion I knew I would be having with my supervisor - I'm just so glad that she called me in sooner rather than later. I'm not sure I could have lasted all week without some kind of conclusion.  Thanks so much for your kind advice and encouragement, r/adhd. I've not been doing the Kick Start Sunday or Win Wednesdays lately, but I'm hoping to get back into them - they really are helpful, and if you haven't participated in them before, I highly recommend you do so!  **TL;DR - Didn't get fired after mildly freaking out about maybe getting fired a couple of days ago. Found out I can't actually get fired because of my ADHD, as long as I continue to be proactive &amp; improve. Immediate supervisors &amp; EEO are all on my side... and I'm feeling much better about the whole situation. Thanks r/ADHD!**
