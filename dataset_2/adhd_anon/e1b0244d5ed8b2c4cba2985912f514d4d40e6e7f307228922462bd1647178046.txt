e1b0244d5ed8b2c4cba2985912f514d4d40e6e7f307228922462bd1647178046;;;Diagnosed with Mild-ADHD;;;Going to the doctor's office tomorrow to see what my options are in terms of medicine. I'm in High School (11th Grade). I made an appointment with a local psychologist to get screened. After a few sessions she diagnosed me with it. I'm a bit confused. I assumed that everyone had a tiny bit of ADHD and just dealt with it. She said I need to try something new in terms of studying as well as try some medicine (vyvanse is what she was getting at). What should I expect now in terms of effects as well as how this will change my life? I'm not worried really I just want to know whats up.
