At times ive heard of people staying there for years and years and ask myself... How the fuck? Is because theyre brains regulate their dopamine levels fine?  Its very torturous for me, i NEED a job that i am emotionally and morally connected to. Its very very hard to fake being enthusiastic about a job if im not interested in it.
