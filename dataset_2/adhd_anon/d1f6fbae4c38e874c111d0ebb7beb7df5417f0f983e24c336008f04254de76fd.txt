I am prescribed 30 mg vyvanse for every day and another 10 mg adderall if i have a lot of work (pre med student, my doctor was very generous).  Basically, i've taken vyvanse every day for many months straight. However, now that i've been off of it for 2 days, i understand i am psychologically "depressed". No, that does not mean i am feeling emotionally depressed. It is simply that i don't have this stimulant in my body any more, i have little to no energy - when i do take it, i'm able to go a full day of class and go to the gym for 1 hour a day. I can't even get myself to the gym these days. Vyvanse also suppresses my hunger (in a good way). Now, i feel like i'm always hungry and have definitely gained a few pounds over the last 3 days.   I know this is **NOT** the purpose for my 10 mg adderall, but I took it yesterday and as i predicted, it got my energy levels that i was able to have a reasonably good workout.   Do you redditors have any advise how to speed up the process of my body (neurologically) getting back to energy levels when i was taking vyvanse? Any tips and tricks if you suffer in a similar way? I wanted be off of it until i begin doing research back at school (~ 3 weeks) for no specific reason, but simply because i didn't feel it was necessary to be on focusing medicine when i have nothing to focus on
