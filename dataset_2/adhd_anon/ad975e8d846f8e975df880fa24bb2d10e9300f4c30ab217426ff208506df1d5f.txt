I figured I would give it a try and see  how well I function on the lower dosage.  I work as an independent programmer and basically use the Number of Billable hours vs Non billable house I get in a week as a metric for how well things are going.   About a week in, I was meeting with a client and ended up leaving my laptop at the restaurant.  I didn't need it for a couple of days, so when I started looking for it, I ended up doing a whole house search which thanks to ADD I have too much experience in doing.  I went to my office to check, while in my car I checked under the passenger seat and ended up 'popping' a rib with help from the armrest I was leaning over. I'll be enjoying the pain of that for about two more months.  The client reminded me that I had the laptop at the meeting we had earlier, and much to my surprise the laptop was still there.  But I ended up having to buy a new power supply to show the manager that I indeed was the owner of the laptop ($80) and left a $20 tip for the person that left it in.    I quickly fell into the old trap of staying up late to try to make up for lost time, and before I knew it morning was here and I had about 3 hours of work to show for it.   I guess that extra 10Mg makes a difference.
