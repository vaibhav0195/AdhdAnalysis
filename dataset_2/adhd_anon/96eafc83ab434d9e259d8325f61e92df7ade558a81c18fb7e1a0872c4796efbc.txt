He screened me and diagnosed me with ADD. The thing I'm worried about is the fact that he said we would work on this through meditation and he brought up the fact it could be helped with medication. I do not necessarily want to be put onto medication but I feel like if it was odd. Does this mean he is completely writing off a medication route? Or that he wants to try a more natural way to help my problem before discussing the possibility of a medication?
