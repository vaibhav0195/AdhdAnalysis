In other words everything is reduced to **willpower** and your evident lack of it.  Since I'm nearly 40 (newly diagnosed) and I can see behind me the waste and damage has left and caused mainly through unrealised potential and feeling like sh*t half the time for not being able to do living as efficiently as those around me I rarely disclose my diagnosis on account of the fact that I don't want to hear how it's all in my head (lol, I know right? They say that to mean you could fix it but it's literal meaning is *exactly my issue*: the problem is in my head).  So. To the "Yes, but everyone-" lines I have this:  **The difference you idiots isn't *qualitative*, it's *quantitative*. We (as well as the depressed, as well as the anxious, as well as alcoholics and morbid overeaters) don't feel like that way *sometimes*, we feel that way *always*. We spend our lives swimming against a current of where our brains try to take us because we want and need to go in the other direction.**  Your feeling that way is relegated to *sometimes* in the same way my **not** feeling like that is. I function well (and hence know the difference with how I function normally and can say it's problematic) in *random*, *unpredictable* moments that constitute and *exception to the rule*.   And the rule is: - I have to convince my self to go to sleep at a reasonable hour and then struggle till 3-4am to fall asleep, every night; - I set three or four alarms, usually scattered around the house, in order to wake up, and sometimes I still fail to manage to wake up in time. Every morning; - I saw people far more stupid than me graduate while I dropped out;  - When I consciously try to focus my mind just loses it and goes bananas (and won't let me). Every time; - When I have to make a choice, any kind of choice, all options seem equivalent mostly and again, my mind loses it, every time; - If I need to buy a white shirt and the sales lady tells me they don't have white shirts this season I don't still think I need a shirt anyway and buy another color because just doing that, going in to buy a white shirt was an enormous struggle for. Every time; - I cannot, **cannot ever** relax. Ever; - I have been constantly told I don't really want the thing I do want because if I did want them I would have done something about them.  Talk about adding insult to injury.  As I said, I am nearly 40. I can show you why ADHD exists with all the things that have happened because of it.
