20350817704001ae8fc139bc693722b539f0c08d60897fe2af842fccf252bd45;;;I have a book to read by Monday. It is my worst nightmare. Help me with strategies, reddit. ;;;College has basically collapsed around me this week. The assignment was given to me on monday, but two art classes both piling on projects and daily hour requirements and english doling out essays, and classes going until 5 most of the week I just have not had time.      I need to read [Napoleon by Felix Markham](http://www.amazon.com/Napoleon-Mentor-Felix-Markham/dp/0451627989/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1321699161&amp;sr=1-2). Normally, I like history. But this book is brutal.      It is not interesting in the slightest. The manner in which it is written destroys any chance of this. Every paragraph is so crammed with different facts and anecdotes that nothing is expanded on. When something seems remotely interesting it doesn't matter because it's moved on from in the blink of an eye. It's so fast and so slow at the same time it is jarring. It somehow has 300 whole pages of these super condensed paragraphs.... what. 300 pages of this shit. I can knock out HP7 in one day but not this.      I need to answer essay questions afterwards. The professor is adamant about making sure we have read the book. He has said that if he can tell we've gotten the information from another source he will fail the paper.      All of these factors make the book unskimmable. And the way it's written, I feel like it's written for people that already are studying Napoleon in length and we haven't, so I am slightly lost even.         Every time I try to read it I just die a little inside. I've been trying to read it this week but it has been disastrous, I am only like 30 pages in.     Help.
