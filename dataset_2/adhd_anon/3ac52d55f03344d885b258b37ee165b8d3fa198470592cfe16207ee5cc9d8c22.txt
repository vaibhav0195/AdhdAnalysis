After a lot of research I think my symptoms side with untreated ADD but the possibility is eating me up and I need support/life advice/your experiences. Thanks guys.;;;I was diagnosed with ADHD as a child, in 3rd grade. It helped enormously, I was able to do good in school and stay out of trouble. I have been off of my meds for several months because of insurance problems and money. While I was off of meds I worked a lot on myself. I had been on adderall  for over 6 years and I wasn’t sure I still needed it, could I survive without it now that I am an adult?? I found that I still struggle with paying attention and it effects my mood but I could control it and live with out medication if I had to.    Now that insurance is finally all sorted out I went to the psychiatrist this week. I was very honest, but I will admit I was a little more dramatic because I have had so many problems with doctors giving me problems and telling me I don’t need meds when I know that I do.     So he said that he would write my the script for Adderall but He wanted me to know that  **he thinks I might be Bipolar II.**  I thought he was just trying to re-diagnose me, but I promised I would go home, research it and keep an eye on my symptoms.    I know there is **nothing wrong** with having mental illnesses, but I am just so scared. Im worried that if this doesn’t work I have an obligation to myself and my husband to try going on bipolar medication. What scares me more than anything is  **what if I take bipolar medication and it WORKS.**  I want to be happy with MYSELF as ME.  When I finally brought it up to my husband last night and told him what happened he agreed with my plan.    My husband told me honestly he definitely thought it was possible that I could bipolar, but just a little bit. He was very sweet and agreed to keep an eye on me and help me observe.   I picked up my prescription for Adderall today and I have this feeling of dread. What if it doesn’t help my mood? What if I am bipolar?    I have been reading a lot of the posts and I think my moods fit better with the descriptions associated with ADD as opposed to Bipolar II. **I can switch through emotions very rapidly** at times. I can get very angry over nothing, but in 10 minutes I am over it. I feel as though I just react to much to some of my emotions, but they don’t last and run their course in normal time. I regret reacting the way I do and I blurt things out. In those moments I KNOW that I am overreacting.  Then reading in the bipolar reddit it learned that emotions can last for days, and Im not like that at all. I have never been suicidal but I was clinically depressed like 6 years ago, but resolved with therapy.   From what I have read in both /r/ADHD /r/BipolarReddit and /r/Bipolar  and the quick online tests I have taken, it seems like it is just untreated ADD, but there is a good chance I am bipolar. I also know that they are comorbid. But I guess I won’t know until Im back on the Adderall for a while a paying attention to my symptoms.    But I had this analogy of a phone.  Sure you are happy with a standard flip phone but once you get an iPhone you can never be happy with a simple phone. It changes your life. Do I want to be on more meds for the rest of my life? how to I know where my personality and a bipolar disorder merge?  I know I am an emotional person, and I am ok with that... its how I discern situations (I’m ENFP if that helps). I was finally in a place where I was content with myself and my brain, and now its all messed up again. **Where I was confident just a few days before I am doubting myself and I hate it.**    **TL;DR: I recently decided to go back on medication to treat ADD, the psychiatrist told me I might be Bipolar. I was confident with myself but now I find myself doubting every emotion and I am scared.**
