I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 7, never medicated.   My first semester in college went pretty poorly, all C's and 1 A. My 2nd semester I failed all of my classes, because on top of my ADHD issues, my mother was in the hospital, which kinda sent me into a depression because I thought my mother was going to get cancer again.    I'm going to see my doctor tomorrow about seeing a psychiatrist or if he will prescribe me something, I'd rather get a referral to the pysch.    I was wondering how to prove my ADHD issues in my appeal? Really just looking for advice from anyone else who has had to write an appeal, because man this shit sucks.   **TL:DR Failed classes due to ADHD and other problems, wondering how to prove ADHD issues affected me.**
