Diagnosed first when i was about 8-9 and slapped on Ritalin. Didn't do much. Recently went and saw a psychiatrist after therapist recommended it. Diagnosed with inattentive type with a healthy dose of comorbid depression. Started me on 10mg IR in the morning, then after about a month moved me to 20mg IR in the morning and a 10mg IR in the afternoon. Side effects are still there, though not nearly as strong as they were initially. Problem I'm having is I still don't feel like anything has changed. I see all these other people talk about Adderall and the moment of clarity when they take it as life changing, yet I still haven't experienced it. So here I am two months later and am actually feeling even more depressed as I had such high hopes. Should I push my psych to up my dose? Will that make the side effects worse? Or should I ask to be switched to vyvanse?
