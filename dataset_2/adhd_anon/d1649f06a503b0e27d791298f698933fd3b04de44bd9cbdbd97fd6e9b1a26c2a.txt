Puryear;;;For years since I was diagnosed, I felt like I needed some sort of instruction manual for dealing with my mind's peculiarities. Where other books, *Driven to Distraction* included, offer anecdotes and general strategies, *Your Life Can Be Better* is the manual I've been looking for.  The author, Dr. Puryear, has ADHD himself, and has treated the subject matter in a personal account of the many strategies he has developed in the course of his life for coping with ADHD. The book is laid out well, and each chapter is short and concise.   I was riveted when I read it, and immediately started using a number of the tools in the book. This is definitely my missing manual, and I'd recommend it to anyone with ADHD, and even people without ADHD.
