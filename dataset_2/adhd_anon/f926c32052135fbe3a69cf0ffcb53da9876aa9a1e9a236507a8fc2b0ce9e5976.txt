f926c32052135fbe3a69cf0ffcb53da9876aa9a1e9a236507a8fc2b0ce9e5976;;;I hate my insurance company;;;Resumed ADHD treatment last fall - psych was nice and close to home saw him every 3 months for ten minutes, picked up a script at the front desk each month in between.  Perfect.  So of course he leaves the practice...  See another psych - same deal.  Nice, same location, 3 months scripts at desk in between..,perfect.  He leaves the practice to go join the other guy.  Tells me I can see either over there as they take the insurance -great.  So I don't need another appt till next month.  Turns out they take the PPO not my HMO version so call to get another doctor - no one takes the HMO anymore.  6 hours of phone calls for my husband later (in the course of a week) he finds out the insurance part that covers this isn't called the HMO it's some other acronym so now calling around to see if the old doctors take that, or if I need to find new,  And as of day after tomorrow I'll be out of meds.  And it's one of the two busiest weeks of the year for me where this twice annual project I head goes into effect and I have a million balls in the air and work 80 hour weeks for 2 weeks.  Yay.  **tldr I am convinced they make insurance extra complicated and run a roundly so we will get frustrated, give up, and won't use it.**
