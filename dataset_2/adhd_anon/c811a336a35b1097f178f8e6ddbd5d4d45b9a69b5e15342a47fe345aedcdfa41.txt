I wanted to know how to go about this. My current doc keeps prescribing the newer meds and I suspect she does this only because the patents on them are haven't lapsed. What's more alarming, though, is that she threatened to stop prescribing different meds to me if this one does not work and rescind her ADHD diagnosis. Though this current med is working--certainly much better than anything before it that she gave me--it has its side-effects and other issues that I would like to try to address with other medication that she obviously pre-empted me from. So......what do I say to the new doc about this? Will the older doc talk to him? Send him her notes and reasoning and telling him that she no longer thinks I have ADHD? Thanks for your help...
