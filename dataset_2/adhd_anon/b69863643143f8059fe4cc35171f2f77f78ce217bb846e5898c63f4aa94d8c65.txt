I'm incredibly optimistic but trying to temper my expectations. So far (three days in) adderall has helped me:  Prioritize. The jumbled cloud in my head sort of settles into steps and tasks and I can actually act on the myriad of stuff my life requires.   Keep track of things. My wallet, phone, keys... Was always an endless search to get my shit together, now I'm more mindful of what I do with my things so that they're in the proper place when I need them.   Not feel so overwhelmed. I have a loooong way to go to get the pieces of my tornado life cleaned up, but I feel pretty accepting of the journey ahead, and it feels manageable.   Fuck yeah science. How have your meds helped you?
