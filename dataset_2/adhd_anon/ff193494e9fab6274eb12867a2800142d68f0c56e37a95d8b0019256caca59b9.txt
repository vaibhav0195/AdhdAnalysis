The list of meds she gave me to choose from consists of:  Adderall, Concerta, Focalin, Intuniv, Kapvay, Strattera, and Wellbutrin as an alternative option.  I've been prescrived to Strattera before, but don't remember whether I liked it or not.  The common side effects for the rest of them make them unappealing, except for Wellbutrin.  I read a little on it and the studies on its use in ADHD is pretty mixed, with the most recent one(that I know of) saying that it was about as effective as placebo.  Has anyone else been prescribed Wellbutrin for ADHD?  If so, what do you think of it?
