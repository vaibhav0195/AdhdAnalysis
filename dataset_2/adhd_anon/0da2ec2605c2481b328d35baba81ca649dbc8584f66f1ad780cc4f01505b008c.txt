This morning I have had my most productive and distraction free day since being diagnosed,  and its not even 1230 here yet. First I was able to wake up early enough to get ready for work and eat breakfast; which I find is almost impossible most days. Even better, I just spent four hours strait working on a speech(I work alone as a security guard and have plenty of time to do whatever I want)  due Tuesday. I finished the outline and all I have to do now is practice it, which I have plenty of time for.  This is my third semester of college, but will be the first one I pass since being diagnosed last September. If you guys don't mind, ill write about how I did this and hear what you guys think of it. Thanks for reading and I hope everyone here has as much of a good day as mine.
