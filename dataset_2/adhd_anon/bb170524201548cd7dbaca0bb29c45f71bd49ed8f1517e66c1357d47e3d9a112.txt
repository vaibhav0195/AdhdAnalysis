A lot of computer programmers like to have music on in the background when they're working, but if it's the wrong *kind* of music, it can be more distracting than helpful.  Too many lyrics, or too many of certain kinds of changes... it can just drag you right out of your task.  I'm a programmer who has ADHD (first diagnosed as an adult over 20 years ago), and I started listening to this stuff, and I found that it helps me a little bit when I want to focus on *anything*.  The pieces I've listened to are kinda ambient background-type stuff, without lyrics, and without sudden changes in tempo or volume or anything like that.  Sometimes, they help me block out some background distractions without being distracting themselves, which has been great.  Anyhow, here's the link:  http://musicforprogramming.net  (I'm not involved with it, just a "satisfied customer", if that term makes sense for a thing that's free.)
