I was put on Ritalin and the dose gradually increased to 80 mg/day. I feel that my ADD could be related to some vitamin or mineral deficiency. Particularly because I had B12 deficiency a year before I got diagnosed with ADD. Are their any recommended tests or assays for vitamins or minerals that I could ask my psychiatrist to prescribe so that we could eliminate that possibility? I would appreciate any ideas, since I have to visit my psych in a week to renew my prescription.
