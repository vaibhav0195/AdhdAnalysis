aa933a7b77e5bee5f510d773a11375f60bc5f1c74f92b03ac3b8b954059a908c;;;Diagnosed at age 22, after a 2 year long process;;;Today, at age 22, I have officially been diagnosed. I did well in high school; I was an A and B student, and participated in plenty of extracurriculars. However, I always waited till last second to do my assignments, I was always disorganized, and I was always running late. I had an amazing internship in my local government and would constantly miss work or be late for reasons I was unable to explain or understand.  In college things got way worse. I had trouble attending my courses, I kept forgetting to submit assignments or when they were due, and my GPA continued to drop. I even lost jobs from my inability to attend or show up on time. I am distracted constantly, and in fact I am distracting to those around me.  When I finally decided to try to get tested, I kept getting told it wasn't ADHD because I had previously performed so well or that I was just seeking aderall. Well, after 2 long years, and my GPA falling from 3.6 to 2.1, I have finally been diagnosed right before starting Law school (I signed up for my LSAT last second, didn't study for it, and even showed up late but luckily did well on the test).   * **I just wanted to ask you what you did after you received your initial diagnosis?** I received mine from a neuropsychologist who preformed extensive testing and history reporting.   * **I have a medication consultation scheduled so I was wondering how that went for you?** How do I prepare for it and what should I expect?  * **Also, how much improvement have you seen since you began medication?** I am still fearful of how I will preform in Law School and am hoping on informing myself as much as possible.  edit 1 :formatting  edit 2: I was diagnosed with Combined Presentation
