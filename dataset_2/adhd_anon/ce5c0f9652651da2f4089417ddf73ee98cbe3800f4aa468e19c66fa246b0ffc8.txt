However I recently learned that the symptoms of Lyme Disease can be very similar. Does anyone have experience with how they are different? I've done some online research but I'm still not able to rule out Lyme disease as a possibility.  I don't really experience joint pain or extreme fatigue I think, though sometimes i do get really tired during the day. I know I can't really know the difference without being tested but if anyone has insight into their differences I'd appreciate it.
