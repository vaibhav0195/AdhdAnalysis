All of my life as far as I can remember I've struggled with half assing everything. School work, video games, relationships, literally everything. I was first diagnosed and started taking vyvanse for treatment my junior year of college. I can only describe vyvanse as it created this "curiosity" in me to challenge myself to learn and do new things. It helped me tremendously to get through the last couple difficult years of school and start a career as a sysadmin. I was quite successful in that field because the higher ups loved me. I was the perfect "band-aid" guy as I loved new challenges but unlike a "normal" person who would want to learn about what caused the problem to prevent it from happening again, my specialty was cutting out all that fluff and just fixing the problem as quickly as possible. This resulted in them coming to me with any quirky, weird thing they knew I'd love and anybody else would scoff at.   The problem with that is, I apply the same "logic" to everything in my life and I don't know why. I am always seeking new challenges but become quickly frustrated and seek the quick fix even if I have to cut corners. Last year I left my sysadmin job to move home and run the family business, 4 restaurants with over 50 employees, and being the boss now I feel like I shouldn't be half assing anything ever, and should actually be pushing others not to either. I'm curious if this is a side effect of ADHD or just a personality flaw. If anyone else feels the same and has changed it, how did you do so? I fight the urge to seek the quick fix as best I can but it really is just that..a fight.
