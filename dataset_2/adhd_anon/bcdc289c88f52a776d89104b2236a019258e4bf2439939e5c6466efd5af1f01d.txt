I was diagnosed with a very light degree of ADHD roughly 3 years ago and when I found out about it my doctor got concerta for me and I was at a 16 mg dose for a long time. and after some time I noticed that it wasn't helping as much as it did in the begining and so I upped my dose to 24 mg and it all was working well again. Up until 6 months ago when I started noticing that I wasn't myself on concerta and I dropped in weigh, lost my apetite, got more introvert etc. and as time passed I started noticing that I couldn't really feel any emotions and got depressed so I decided to stop taking it. now I'm feeling way better and more like me but I'm still in school and I'm working so I need to find a way to help me with it so anyone got any good suggestions?
