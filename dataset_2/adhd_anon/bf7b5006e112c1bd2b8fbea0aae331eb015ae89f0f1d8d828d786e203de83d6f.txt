bf7b5006e112c1bd2b8fbea0aae331eb015ae89f0f1d8d828d786e203de83d6f;;;Studying for MCAT and on the verge of mental breakdown;;;I have been diagnosed with ADHD for 4 years now and the time has come to take my MCAT exam to get into medical school. I am prescribed 70mg of Vyvanse daily but it just has no effect on me anymore. I find myself taking 2 and sometimes 3 pills instead of one just to get myself to study. This obviously can't be good for me, so any tips? Anything would be appreciated.  Thank you
