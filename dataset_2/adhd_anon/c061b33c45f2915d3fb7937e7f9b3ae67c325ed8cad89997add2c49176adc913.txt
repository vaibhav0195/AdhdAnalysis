c061b33c45f2915d3fb7937e7f9b3ae67c325ed8cad89997add2c49176adc913;;;Just started medication. How long does it take to notice changes;;;I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was in primary school, and I was put on Ritalin until early high school. I had largely forgotten this, and only after taking an online test and talking to my Mum did I realise that it could be the cause for my constant struggle at work and with personal projects.  I have recently been rediagnosed and my doctor put me on Dexamphetamine 5 mg.  I have been taking it for 4 days now, and I don't notice anything.  The first day (Friday) I felt like I got some work done, but then I did nothing of value on the weekend, and here at work on Monday I still feel like I have to drag myself through it all.  Do I just need to be patient and wait, or am I expecting too much?   Edit: (Just read the label and fixed the spelling "Dexamphetamine").  Thanks all for the help, I wasn't sure if I was just being impatient, but now I know I need to talk to my doctor about the dose.  Thanks :)
