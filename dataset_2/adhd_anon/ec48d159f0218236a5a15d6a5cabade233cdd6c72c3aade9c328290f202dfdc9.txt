I don't know if it's going to work.;;;Hello all,   I just want to say I really appreciate anyone who can share their 2 cents. I started taking Vyvance yesterday for an undetermined but everlasting case of ADHD. (I say undetermined because my diagnosis was a very short appointment, but I say everlasting because I'm certain that I have an attention deficiency). MY QUESTION: Is it normal to feel no benifets and simply be jittery the first few days of starting up? I've heard that if it only makes you jittery, then it won't help you. I spoke with my pharmacist and he said that my body is probably just adjusting to having the amphetamine in it and that it may even take up to a couple weeks to see results.   I'd love to hear some first hand experiences on what you guys went through. Any help is greatly appreciated, thanks!
