1744f6b0236e7c3ebdc784b115a95bad95924957798138077f807f3ff3a1fe58;;;Hello All!;;;I just found this subreddit a few minutes ago, I am very happy and very relieved that I don't have to feel alone or as different as everyone makes me as. I was diagnosed with ADHD since i was around 7 (now 20) its been a constant struggle in school, family life, and relationships. I am very forgetful, constantly tired at times, and overall have a hard time keeping shit organized. I've been off ritilin since i was 10 so i cannot recall my medicated history. I have managed this far with people telling me im an idiot, your parents didn't do this or that for or to you, its all in your head, it doesn't exist, and so on. Hell the love of my life doesn't even accept it, but i grew to live with it and moved on. Sometimes i feel like i do have RLS as i constantly shake and tap my legs. I see this as a ventilation for excess energy when sitting. Anyway...I am happy to be here and happy to find others that understand.
