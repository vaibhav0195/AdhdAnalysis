I never think of the consequences only then and now is this a symptom of ADHD? or am i just unique like that? thanks;;;I never think of the consequences, i just do. i wanna do something i do it on a whim as soon as i think of it, i want to say something i say it. it does not matter if that thing i will say will offend the person i am talking to or if walking doing a back-flip off that ladder will sprain my ankle i never consider that. is this a symptom of ADHD? or am i just unique like that? Apologies if this question is super dumb.
