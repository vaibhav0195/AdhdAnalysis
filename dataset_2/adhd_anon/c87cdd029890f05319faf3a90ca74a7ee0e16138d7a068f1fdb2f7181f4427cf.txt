I'm 25 and I've always known something wasn't quite "normal" about me, but always figured that's just how I was. My girlfriend and I were talking a few weeks ago about my short temper and how I've always gotten so easily frustrated over every little thing and it can set me off.. I've tried working on my anger and frustration my whole life all sorts of different ways.. I'm surprised she's still stuck with me through all my shit. Lol She suggested maybe it wasn't normal and I should look into it.   Somehow I ran across someone saying this could be a sign of adult ADHD, and as soon as I started looking into it, it was like a lightbulb went off in my head. Literally every thing about it described my life down to a tee. And my mom is the same way.   Back through highschool and until I was 22 I did a lot of partying and stupid shit. Experimented around with lots of substances. MDMA was my favorite. Made a lot of "impulse" decisions.. Thankfully I didn't get addicted to anything and i don't mess with any of that any more. I don't even smoke pot any more. I went back to school and I should be graduating next year..  I'm wondering if it gets brought up at the psychiatrist if I should admit to it. I don't want him to think I'm just some junkie and I'm just there to try to get drugs.. I just know my life seems a little more difficult than most for no reason.. And if I do have ADHD, I don't want my past stupid decisions to affect my chances of getting some much needed help..   **TLDR: Should I tell doc about past drug use if it isn't an issue any more? And what are yalls experiences?**
