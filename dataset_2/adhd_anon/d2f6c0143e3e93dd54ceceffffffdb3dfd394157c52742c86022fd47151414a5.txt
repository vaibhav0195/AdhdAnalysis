My issue with them is that I feel better, but I'm just as disorganised and 'weird' as I was before I knew what was wrong with me.  Basically, I'm just sick of being so vulnerable and constantly second guessing my own decisions, thoughts and feelings. Strattera seems like my final chance of putting the brakes on this rollercoaster I call life.  Will strattera do anything for low self esteem that stimulants can't?  What are the benefits/ downsides of this substance? What can I expect from strattera, how do they differ from ritalin mood wise? Do those of you that are on it feel balanced, maybe even peaceful?  Lots of rambling here, but I guess you're pretty much used to that :-)
