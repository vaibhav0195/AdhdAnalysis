I'd yell very loudly and get scary, or go totally to the other side and not do much but tell him it was bad. (But I'd *never* hit him.)    I've been working on consistency (which is so, so hard with ADHD) and I've been getting better, but it's still hard to get proportionality right.    Today, my (probably extremely ADHD) son intentionally (if it had been a mistake, I wouldn't have been so upset) scratched our new coffee table with a toy knife. I took the knife from him, told him that if he couldn't be responsible, he couldn't have toys like that anymore, and sent him to his room. Every impulse was screaming at me to yell and be scary, but I didn't. I let him think a while, then I went up to talk to him about why damaging things isn't okay, and how it's important to show respect to each other by trying to keep things nice. He understands, and I've taken his play date privileges for tomorrow, since we had no special plans today. I also explained that, while I really didn't like what he *did*, I still love *him* no matter what happens.    I think I've figured out how to discipline my son without tearing down his self-esteem, which is rough enough in those of us with ADHD. Now I just need to remember what this feels like so I can keep doing it! :)
