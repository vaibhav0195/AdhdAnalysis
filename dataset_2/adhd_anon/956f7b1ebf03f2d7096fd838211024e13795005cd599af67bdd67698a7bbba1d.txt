Similar experiences?;;;I'm ADHD-PI, and always fit in the shy category growing up. I don't think I was I was really shy, I mean I was quiet but that's because most of the time I was uncontrollably zoning out and getting distracted by other things, which made it hard to notice some body language and social cues, like when I was boring the other  person to death in conversations. I also always had trouble of thinking of stuff to say in conversations (basically my mind couldn't keep up with conversations, so I was very passive), fumbled words a ton, and when I had such trouble focusing it was hard to come across as interested or expressive. I also used to constantly struggle to remember people's names which got me bullied. I was also home-schooled for a good portion of my time in middle school, which deprived me of a lot of different social environments, because my parents saw my academic struggles and inability to keep up, not as ADHD or even my fault (I wasn't diagnosed until I was 20 years old), and how I was constantly bullied.        After this, I really lagged behind socially and really fit into the socially awkward category. I also developed social anxiety because of being awkward and how mainly when people spoke to me I was accused of being lazy and unmotivated and made fun of, so I often felt like people would only talk to me because I did something wrong. Once I was diagnosed with ADHD and put on vyvanse, I really was able to improve my social skills and get them up to par, notice other people's body language and expressions way more easily, and carry on conversations that aren't one-sided. I also realized that I did understand a lot of stuff about body language and could get a good read of people just as long as I could focus on it and be confident about myself, though I still had some learning and catching up to do.  Some people used to think I was autistic (one ER doctor even tried to label me as that in the 10 minutes he saw me) because I was socially awkward and smart though I don't think I am though I still worry about it at times. Can ADHD affect your social skills and make it seem like you're autistic? What are your thoughts on this? Is there any link between ADHD and social awkwardness? Similar experiences?
