My doctor started me off on 5 mg adderall twice a day and after two weeks bumped it up to 20 mg XR (which is 10 mg twice a day as I understand). I've been on the 20 mg XR for a month now and I've noticed that the medication doesn't last the whole day, it last about 5 hours. I actually realized that from the beginning but listened to my dr and followed her instructions. I work 10 hours a day in a laboratory and my job relies on my ability to focus. When the medication is working it's been a complete God send, but after lunch I am back to my old self. How should I go about addressing these issues with my doctor? Is there another medication I should ask to try?
