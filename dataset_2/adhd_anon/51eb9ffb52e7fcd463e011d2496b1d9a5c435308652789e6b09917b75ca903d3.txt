My wife mentioned at the doctor yesterday that I seem to have anxiety issues but I did not connect the dots to realize it is a separate issue that complicates things just a bit.  also after talking with my sister we realized that anxiety issues run in the family.  So I'm trying to get a feel for how other people deal. I'm not expecting a magic bullet or a medication fix. I do not think my anxiety issues are not something other people have had to deal with. I plan on going to my doctor to address this but I've found that if I go in with an idea of what my issues are the conversation is more of a discussion and less a lecture.   EDIT: I'm going to go see my doctor regarding this. But it is helpful to talk to other people.
