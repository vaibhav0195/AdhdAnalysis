Lots of ruined relationships.;;;I should start by saying I'm not on medication yet, got another month to go before I start on it.  I've started to notice lately that I can't have a proper conversation with anybody, or empathize with their problems as a direct result of that.  I'm so spacey that I will literally drift off within 5 seconds of someone initiating a conversation with me, and it's making me appear as really cold towards others (can't blame them for thinking that though).  The worst part of it is, I seem to have developed some sort of mental "Auto-pilot" that allows me to carry conversations, albeit in a very stiff manner, without actually mentally processing what others say to me.  I'll be off in the perpetual fog that is my mind, yet I can still subconsciously react to conversational cues.  For example:  **Them:** How was your day?   **Me:** Not bad, yours?   **Them:** Pretty good, I got X and Y done at work.   **Me:** Oh, that's good.  How're things with person x?   Etc. etc.  Meanwhile, the whole time I've interpreted nothing of what they've said.  I've had 5 minute back-and-forth conversations with others, and end up asking them afterwards what exactly we were talking about.  This usually confuses the shit out of people because I was staring them in the eyes the whole time and was actually talking/asking questions specific to whatever the topic was.  I present myself as very much normal, but in my head everything's a mess.  I'm usually thinking about something that happened earlier, or I picked up on a word that the person said and am making a thousand different mental connections about it while they progress in the conversation.  A direct result of the above is that I can't empathize well with others.  Somebody comes to me telling me they've had a rough day?  I'm mentally checked out, and listened to maybe 20% of what they've said.  I hate that I do this, especially with the people I actually care about, but I simply can't focus on a conversation, regardless of how dire the situation is.  I've tuned out when people are talking about a relative that just died, and I hate myself in those moments.  I try my hardest to snap myself back to listen, but it rarely works.  Anyways, I was wondering if anybody else experiences this sort of thing while unmedicated.  Did medication help you to be able to focus on others?  I've honestly put my dating life on hold because of the above problems; my last few relationships ended because I was so mentally (and therefore, emotionally) distant, and it's not fair for me to put others through that.  **TL;DR: Can't focus on conversations with anybody, regardless of how close I am with them, and it has ruined a lot of otherwise great relationships.  Wondering if others have had similar experiences in the past.**
