While in high school I was diagnosed with Depression and ADHD. I was given Ritalin for ADHD and Prozac (later switched to Paxil) for depression. I noticed I was getting addicted to one of the pills. I don't recall which, but I started loving the hour or so "high" it gave me. I think it had some sort of amphetamine or similar in it. I was able to pay attention to everything that was happening without my mind wandering and was actually interested in what was being talked about for the hour duration. Once I recognized that I was becoming addicted I completely stopped taking all pills and stopped going to the doctor all together. It has been a long time. I have been able to make tremendous strides fighting depression on my own (which I do not recommend or suggest. It was a long struggle). I have not been able to overcome in any way shape or form my ADHD. I am thinking about going back to the doctor to talk to them about my options, but I am scared. I think I'm just here for support before I go back to the doctor.    uh...I just want to say I am scared again.   Thanks for whatever you say.
