For for the first time I wasn't overwhelmed with life. My room was organized. I could sit down and finish simple homework tasks straight through. For once I could make it to work on time and finish all my assignments with no problem.   I realized that I was not a failure, that I indeed had a problem that medication could help! But then... My tolerance kept rising and my doc kept getting suspicious I was seeking I guess? I told her I had class after work and needed something to cover from 9 am to 9pm she wrote me a perscription for 4 10mg adderalls split throughout the day but it was simply not enough. When I came in telling her this she yelled at me and told me she can't go any higher so instead she wrote me a rx for strattera. This past week of strattera has been hell, I haven't even touched my hw, all I do now is sleep. As soon as I came back from work I pass out and have no motivation.  My question is.....what do I do? How do I explain to my doc that I truly and not seeking and strattera is not helping. Does anyone have any succes stories with strattera? Will it improve Should I stick with it?  School is getting rough and I can't risk my add getting the way. I've paid 10 thousand out of pocket for this semester alone and I still have no motivation to sit down work and succeed for some reason. Any advise from you guys would be greatly appreciated.
