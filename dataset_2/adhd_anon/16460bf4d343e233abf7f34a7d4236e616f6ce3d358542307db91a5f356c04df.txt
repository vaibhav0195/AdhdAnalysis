16460bf4d343e233abf7f34a7d4236e616f6ce3d358542307db91a5f356c04df;;;went to a neurologist for memory problems, getting tested, online test says PROBABLY;;;&gt;Results of your &gt;Attention Deficit Disorder Quiz &gt; &gt;You scored a total of  79 &gt; &gt;It is highly likely that you are presently suffering from adult attention deficit disorder, according to your responses on this self-report questionnaire. You should not take this as a diagnosis of any sort, or a recommendation for treatment. However, it would be advisable and likely beneficial for you to seek further diagnosis from a trained mental health professional immediately.  it was this [test](http://psychcentral.com/addquiz.htm)  OK so the online test thing is stupid and not scientific AT ALL, i get it.  Just thought that it was pretty telling that I scored 79 and i sent it to two of my "normal" friends and they were both in the 20s  Moving on, i have some long term memory "issues."  I can't seem to recall large portions of my childhood and other more recent periods.  I'm getting an MRI to rule out anything physical (doc says most likely not) but the more we dug into the simple tests, he asked if I was ever diagnosed with ADD and says that he has a sinking suspicion that I might have it.  He also went on to talk about how ADD drugs tend to be over prescribed and the ADD diagnosis seems to be given out too often w/o proper testing, so I have the feeling he's not just trying to medicate me and move on with life.  So here goes, time to make my appt for the 4-6 hour testing.  I should have some sort of insight soon.  any advice for a potential new member to the club?  I've added a few books to my amazon cart, going to try to read up a little.  tl;dr: i probably have adult add, ok now what?
