936e57f89c42dd27b729fa571b1d2fc5ae216bcd37c4536b64a479d5727466e3;;;15 and diagnosed with ADHD. What now?;;;Hey!     I'm 15 years old and I just got diagnosed with ( I guess mild) ADHD.     It started when I had troubles learning in school and my mom took me to a doctor who diagnosed it.     They said that unfortunately in my childhood they couldn't see that I have ADHD because I have a above average intellect and I hide this problem with it.     I got some papers that I can't get grades from math etc...     I don't know really what to do because they said that I can't really recover fully because I got diagnosed too late so I will probably have adult ADHD too. I know that this can get worse and all these things but I don't know what to do.     I think I have severe depression with suicidal tendencies too and I just feel like I don't deserve to be alive when I'm a genetic garbage.     TL;DR: I got diagnosed don't know what to do next.
