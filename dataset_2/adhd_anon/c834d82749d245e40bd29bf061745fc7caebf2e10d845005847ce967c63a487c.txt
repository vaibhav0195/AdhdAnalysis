She has majorly struggled in school and just recently started homeschooling (I am her homeschool tutor and I have ADD as well so we make a great pair haha). She is super behind, she barely knows how to read(we're working on that), she can't get any work done on her own. She gets really overwhelmed really easily and is crying at least once a week, and throwing hissy fits nearly every day. She is also physically handicapped from Polio, and she seems really depressed.  She has had some horrible teachers and my parents just want to sweep her problems under the rug. They've tried to get her treated in the past but there were a lot of problems with it and they just can't afford it. She has been ignored and treated like the bad kid her whole life. She is so beat down. I tell her that she is not stupid and that she is good at other things, but it doesn't seem to be enough.   What can I say to her? I'm thinking of maybe writing her a special letter or something. Really, I'd do anything to help her. I'd even try to pay for her treatment myself if that is the only option.
