9b76088614cbfeb51341d241c821cd0ee3917ad9a4c1551ba1bdf1382395066c;;;I believe ADHD is Genetic, what does /r/ADHD think;;;Ive was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 8 and recently i learned that my grandfather has all the symptoms of ADHD but was never diagnosed beacuase when he grew up ADHD wasnt a thing. After finding this out I noticed that my mother and aunt have symptoms that could be linked to ADHD but are overlooked because they are not promenent enough for a diagnosis.  With this in mind it got me thinking about how so many people in my mothers side of the family have ADHD like symptoms and it hit me, ADHD may be Genetic.  I believe ADHD is linked to the X Chromosome and its a Semi-dominant Allele that expresses parts of itself along side more dominent alleles. With this hypothesis it would explain why ADHD is more prominent in males and why its been passed down through my family like it has.  Does anyone else have a thoughts on my hypothesis?  Edit: Words
