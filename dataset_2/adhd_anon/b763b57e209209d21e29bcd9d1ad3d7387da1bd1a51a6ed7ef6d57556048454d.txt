Due to the rigorous nature of college, it is one of the places where people with ADHD are most in need of access to treatment.  Is it fair to deny them the right to medical help because of the possibility that a small number of them could end up selling or abusing their medication? Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, and borderline personality disorder are all treated and diagnosed by the psychiatrist on campus.  I feel that people with ADHD are being discriminated against. Many students do not have health insurance, so their only access to healthcare is through the university. These students don't have the money to see a doctor at a private practice. And why should they have to?  I haven't looked into this very far yet, but I feel very strongly about it and I want the letter to go to the right place and I want it to be persuasive and accurate. Does anyone have any suggestions as to where to start, or what I should write, etc? Better yet, does anyone have a counterargument to bring up?  **TL;DR:** My school won't diagnose or treat ADHD. I feel this is discrimination against people with the disorder, so I'm going to write them a letter asking them to change their policy. Any thoughts?  **EDIT:** I should clarify a couple of things:   1) I already have a diagnosis and am being treated. I had originally tried to do this through the health center, but was denied. I had to wait a long time until I could go home, six hours away, during winter break and see my psychiatrist. My insurance provider only operates in certain regions.  2) My university does provide accommodations for people with disabilities, ADHD included. As a student with ADHD, I can take tests in a separate location and have priority registration, among other things. It's the health center, a separate entity, that does not provide diagnoses or medication for ADHD even though it does so for other psychiatric conditions.  **Also**, thanks for all of your responses! I'm sorry I can't provide better answers for those of you who are just as curious as I am about the situation. I posted this so I could get your advice and opinions before I launched into research and then writing a letter. When I do the research and find out what's what, I will definitely do a follow-up post!
