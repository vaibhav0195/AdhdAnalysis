I'm 18 at university.  Okay so here's what i think I have: - During class I noticed that i constantly fidget with my hands. I have a habit of rubbing my chin with my hands. - I also have a leg tapping problem i do this uncontrollably and some students get bothered (in high school). - I feel sometimes a lot with energy and I can concentrate a little then I start going off and day dream, go on my phone during class - I also feel irritable like I wanna get up and go somewhere else even when I try to study a lone on a comfortable chair. - this energy then makes me tired in the day and I sleep in class even though I get 8-9 hour sleep - its so hard to follow the teacher I just can't do it - i forget a lot o things like bringing my lunch from work (all the time) and I leave for home leaving my left over lunch at work - I get a weird feeling in my eyes and forehead during class - when I was little I used to say and do stuff that caused me embarrassment or made fun of someone. Without thinking - when I starve myself it's like I'm with a lot of energy and I constantly do stuff - during class I always misread a question and do something accidentlyn on my answer - I never was diagnosed - I was above average in middle school and now I'm doing horribly - I lack a lot of motivation sometimes I would just lay in my room do nothing  How can I make sure of i have it also how can I make sure the counselor doesn't misdiagnose or give me a wrong treatment. What should I also look forward too?  Thanks reddit!
