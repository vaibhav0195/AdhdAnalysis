Applying to colleges!;;;Okay so I have recently been applying to colleges and I want to tell them how much my life has changed after being diagnosed with adhd. Before my senior year I had a GPA of around 3.1, however towards the end of my first semester as a senior I got my diagnosis and started different study strategies and medication. At the end of this semester I got a 3.7 GPA and scored a 29 on my ACT. I phoned the school I want to attend and he told me to send him an email explaining everything. What should I say without sounding like I'm making excuses??
