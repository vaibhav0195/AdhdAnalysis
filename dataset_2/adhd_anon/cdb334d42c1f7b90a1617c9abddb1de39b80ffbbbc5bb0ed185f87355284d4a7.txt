cdb334d42c1f7b90a1617c9abddb1de39b80ffbbbc5bb0ed185f87355284d4a7;;;My own successful experience of ADHD treatment;;;Hello, my name is Nikolay Perov, I am from Moscow, Russia. I run personal development website on Russian and English languages.  Among articles on my site there is a post "Coping With ADHD Without Drugs (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) â€“ 14 Methods"  This post is based on my own experience of coping with ADHD. Some time ago i wasn't able to focus attention, i was impulsive and impatient.  Because of ADHD i was not able to study and work well, i had problems in relationship, i smoked cigarettes and drunk a lot of beer. It helped to channel the excessive energy on some activity.  Now it's in the past. I don't drink or smoke, i can concentrate on working activity, i am calm and patient.   I want to share principles which helped me to cope with ADHD with people. I hope this article will be useful for someone.  Please feel free to comment in this topic or on the pages of my blog, i will answer your questions.  Thank you for your restless attention (ha-ha)  Here is the link  http://nperov.com/health/coping-with-adhd-without-drugs/
