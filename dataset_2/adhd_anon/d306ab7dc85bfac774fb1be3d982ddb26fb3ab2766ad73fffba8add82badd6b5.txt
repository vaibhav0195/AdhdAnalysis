BUT, here goes.  For a long time I've felt like time moved exceptionally slow (except, occasionally, at times when it goes too fast) and that I am the only normal-speed person around me. There are times when this gets intensified and I cannot handle how slow everything is! Music near always seems too slow; when I put it on 1.5 speed, it finally sounds 'right'. Things I don't want to do drag on so so long. For some reason adderall fixes this and I'll feel like I'm actually on the same wavelength as everyone else... if that makes sense?  Has anyone else experienced something remotely similar or know what causes it?
