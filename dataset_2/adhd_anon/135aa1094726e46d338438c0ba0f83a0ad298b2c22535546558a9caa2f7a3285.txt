How to stop feeling this way?;;;I feel like im a fake person on medication. Yes I know it helps but its the worst feeling ever. Being temporarily smart knowing I need medication feels so bad. Tired and dumb without medication smart with it. I don't like taking it but i feel like i need to for other people. I want to be successful but then i really feel like im living through a drug and it sucks.   I know my life is better with medication but I can't shake this feeling above. And its hurting my life in all aspects.
