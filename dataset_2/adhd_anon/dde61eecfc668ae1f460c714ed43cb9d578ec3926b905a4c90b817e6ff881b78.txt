How can I improve my off-the-cuff speaking at work?;;;I've always been better at organizing my thoughts for writing than for speaking, which is great when I'm writing a chart note in a patient's file. It might take me a bit longer than most, but the notes are at least clear and relatively concise. But when I'm speaking, I have a really hard time getting to the point quickly and making a strong case for myself unless I've written everything out first. That no longer works because I just don't have the time at work - things move too fast and I'm already noticeably less efficient than my coworkers.  So, how can I get better at organizing my thoughts in a way that translates to speech well? This question came up last night when I was trying to make the case for a patient to get an operation. I was confident in my diagnosis but I was overridden by my boss. This morning of course, it turns out that my diagnosis was correct. I think if I could have articulated my thoughts more clearly and made a stronger case for my thoughts, things would have gone differently. No harm ultimately came from this situation, but it's a skill I know I need to improve. "Because I just know, ok?"isn't very convincing. :p
