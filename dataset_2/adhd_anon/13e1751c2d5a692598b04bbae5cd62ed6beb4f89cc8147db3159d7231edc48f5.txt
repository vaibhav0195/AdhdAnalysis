But I guess I'd like to hear from some experienced people if it "matters."  I am a 30/F who decided I needed some extra help. Had my results evaluation last week. The psych very confidently diagnosed me with GAD. He also said, "You definitely express and exhibit ADHD symptoms, but you hold down a demanding job and you say you are capable of cleaning your house. You're borderline. ADHD: Unspecified is for this kind of situation, where I'm not prepared to give you an official diagnosis." I am continuing with therapy and starting a low dose of Intuniv to try to help with both acronymns.  Came home and looked it up, and the definition of ADHD:US is pretty much exactly what he said, but I don't understand it. Seems like if you don't qualify for a diagnosis, you shouldn't need a not-quite category. But if I really do present with symptoms, what does hedging his bet do for him/me/a diagnosis? Is it an ADA thing? When I read about ADHD in women, it really resonates with me. I wonder if I accurately represented myself. Just confused I guess. Does it matter?  TL;DR diagnosed with ADHD: Unspecified, which he termed "unofficial," does having an "official" diagnosis matter any more or less going forward?
