Timeline and documentation inside.;;;Documentation of my FIRST DAY ON **RITALIN 10mg**! 18/10/2014  Male, 25yo, 79kg, highly athletic (competitive cyclist)  Recently diagnosed, never medicated before.  **10:27** | 65 bpm | Taken ritalin 10mg. Sitting on desk at pc.  **10:31** | 66 bpm | I think I feel something already going on. Slight tension on the under-eye area. Slight inexplicable sensation on chest. Kind of provokes deeper-heavier breathing.  **10:47** | 65 bpm | Checking in. Not much change. Though I feel slight change in consciousness / focus when moving head around, as if mildly tipsy. Leg muscles feel warmer and better, as if taken little magnesium after heavy cycling workout.  **11:08** | 69 bpm | Half hour in, no perceivable news. Have started working on some Uni work as I wait in front of the pc for stuff to happen and log.   **11:28** | 70 bpm | One hour in. Did the previous pomodoro (time-chunk) of work (13 minutes) without effort, although ultra-easy work complexity. Heart rate seems to jump around much more at 67-72 bpm. Don't feel any perceivable change in consciousness or focus. Don't feel less easy to get distracted.  **11:49** | 63 bpm | Just did another pomodoro of Uni work. Focusing was maaaybe a bit easier, but not nearly enough to be remotely sure it's the Ritalin. Seems like studying in the library with headphones had the same --or slightly better-- effect. Still felt the urge to check facebook etc when stuff turned more complex. Also, evidently HR dips to the low 60's when focused on work, which quite invalidates it's whole logging I guess.  Edit: FYI, I noticed that this last note took me 5 minutes to write down.  **12:40** | 68 bpm | 2+ hours in. I should have reached max methylphenidate concentration in blood plasma by now. Nothing impressive to note overall in focus, consciousness, urge to procrastinate: all pretty much normal (as in ADD normal). Maybe slightly easier to get myself to start some small task, though still familiar difficulty remains apparent. Overall it feels like something unfamiliar is going on, but too mild to pinpoint specifically, except the "mild tipsiness" I initially described. NO perceivable side effects, though, which is great!  **13:55** | 69 bpm | Just finished sending an email to a prof accepting to work on his proposal as my thesis. Took me 2 (13m) pomodoros but felt easy to start and follow through. Also easy to send my online application on this semester's courses I'll follow. Both I've been postponing  systematically. Feeling slight clenching in my stomach, but then again haven't eaten anything since morning except tea. This isn't irregular for me though (postponing eating even though hungry).  **14:17** | 68 bpm | Almost 4 hours in, Ritalin should be mostly out or on its way now. I do feel my legs getting back colder/normal and like I have to think more to write this log here and more eager to drift away.   **Verdict:** The fact that I got to write this log, is something in itself. It seems like something mildly conceivable is happening and.. that's it. I felt no particular "high", nor side effects. Was not uber-productive out of nowhere, but I definitely got stuff done (also some little things that are not narrated above), with admittedly not much effort and without postponing them really. Methylphenidate also seems to not have induced any spikes in my HR as expected, which is good for my training. It sparks my interest to see the effects on the 20mg dose, probably end of this, or start of next week. I'll (probably :P) keep you up to date.

On top of every other "hard-mode" like race, monetary, social or other situation. Every single day we have to face failure, multiple times even and the letting down of ourselves and worse, that of the people we love. And we do it.   It's painful being let down *and* mad with yourself, and on rare occasions you may slip down into very dark and dangerous places in your mind because of it. And yet we climb out.  We face the social stigma of living on drugs and even worse the judgment and ignorance that follows most invisible conditions. And yet we accept it.  We sometimes have to *work* and *push ourselves through* to "achieve" even the simple trivial tasks everyone just goes about doing effortlessly. Things like personal care, hygiene, fuckin eating and sleep. And yet we shower and clean the house (most of the times) and sleep on full stomach (if even it's fast food yet again) .   I know I kinda suck. There's lots of reasons for someone to call me stupid and lazy and careless and disrespectful and ignorant and a waste of time (literally even...). And fuck me, I have called all these myself many times and probably will again. But man, there are some moments like this that we all have to just look back and be proud of all the shit we have achieved. And be double fuckin proud because it's been achieved through adversity, and when the mind is the obstacle then damn, that's one hell of an adversity you have pushed through, you tough motherfucker, you...  To our successes, and many more to come, /r/ADHD.  Enjoy your holidays.  ---  EDIT: I am so glad that just my putting together of a few words can touch so deeply and positively the souls of so many people. I would be entirely content even if my post could help just one of you that needed something like this. I've read every one of your replies and pm's you've sent me. What we have going on here is and feels awesome. :)
