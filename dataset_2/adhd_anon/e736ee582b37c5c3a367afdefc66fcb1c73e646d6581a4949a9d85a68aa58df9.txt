e736ee582b37c5c3a367afdefc66fcb1c73e646d6581a4949a9d85a68aa58df9;;;Diagnosed today but there's a problem;;;Went to see a specialist today and was diagnosed, I'm so happy that it's not just that I'm lazy and that I can have meds, however I am at uni and my term finishes in two weeks so I have to go through my whole exam period with no meds and see another specialist at home to get them and I'm worried about my work load, what are your guys non medicated study tips that I can use?
