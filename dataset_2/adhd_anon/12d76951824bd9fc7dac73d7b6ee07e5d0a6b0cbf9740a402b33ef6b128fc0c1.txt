I was recently diagnosed with ADHD. At first I didn't really realize how much it affected me but over the last few months it has become more and more apparent and I really feel crippled by it.  I am an artist and I like to work on all different kinds of art. I draw comics, I design worlds, I write songs, and other sorts of things.  I'll get really hyped up about a new idea or drawing or song or whatever and spend hours working on it but unless whatever I'm working on can be finished in one sitting it rarely ends up completed. I have a painfully hard time bringing myself to work on any kind of project more than once.  I love coming up with ideas for epic webcomic masterpieces with overarching themes and enormous worlds and creative creatures and environments. And I have an easy enough time planning it out but once the task is drawing the first page or writing the first line of description then the whole idea seems too daunting to even begin and I always get so discouraged.  I feel so shitty every time I get excited about a new plan or a new idea and then I never follow through with it. And this doesn't just happen with art, it reflects in other parts of my life too. For example I was getting into gymnastics last year. I'm not the most athletic person but I'm limber-ish and I figured it would be a cool, fun way to stay in shape. For the first few classes I was killing it, I was super motivated and I worked really hard and progressed quickly. But after a couple weeks both my motivation and energy level started declining and I found myself more and more tired during classes until one day while I was practicing my backflip (which I had done successfully on my own) I put so little effort into it that I nearly landed on my head. Thankfully my instructor was spotting me and he pushed me to safety. After that experience I didn't feel safe continuing my training.  The pattern tends to be that I'll be very excited and very focused and involved in a new activity or idea and I'll perform really well, but lose interest so quickly and it sucks!  I just want to be able to make a really awesome comic book, or keep working on gymnastics until I can do cool tricks and be fit and everything, or record an album or something, but I always end up stopping before I've even begun.  I've thought about taking medication or getting treated or whatever but I also don't want to become dependent upon a drug. I know it may sound kind of hippie-dippie but I'd rather find a way to overcome this obstacle on my own. I may also just be scared of negative rumors I've heard about ADD/ADHD medication.  What do you guys think?  **TL;DR**: I get excited about stuff but never follow through. Should I take meds?  **edit**: paragraphs!
