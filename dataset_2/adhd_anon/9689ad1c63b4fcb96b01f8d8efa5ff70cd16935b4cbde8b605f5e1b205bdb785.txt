To rule out thyroid issues and ensure I didn't have any underlying heart problems, I went to my primary care doctor for a checkup. The results were unexpected: everything fine, except for an very low testosterone level. It was about 190, which I believe puts me in about the bottom 1 or 2% for my age. (For reference, the average level for someone in their 60's is about twice that.)  So my question is: Could low testosterone levels explain a diagnosis of ADHD? I see on WebMD that it could cause poor concentration, so could it also explain inattention, distractability, fidgeting, etc?   By the way, my doctor says "no, but it could make the ADHD seem worse." What do you all think?
