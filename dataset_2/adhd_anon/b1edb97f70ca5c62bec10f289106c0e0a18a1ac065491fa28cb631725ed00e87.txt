b1edb97f70ca5c62bec10f289106c0e0a18a1ac065491fa28cb631725ed00e87;;;Freaking out... IB breakdown;;;UPDATE: Thank you everyone. You have calmed me down. Almost everything is done, all that's left are exams! I'm going to make it! A friend of mine gave me particularly good advice: "You don't have a choice." When I realized that, I just kept going.  My exams are in four days. I feel like I'm not going to be able to pull of my exam miracles of past and suddenly get a top grade without trying.   I have a CAS portfolio that I slacked off on for two years due tomorrow that I now have to make up.  I have to make my uni decision by Wednesday and that involves re-researching the college where I got accepted.   I need to update my FAFSA by hand because the IRS data retrieval tool refuses to function.  My emotions are totally out of wack lately. I get these rages that I have to keep in because screaming in public and flipping tables is not socially acceptable. I'm feeling more and more destructive and I need to express these urges. I threw eggs against a wall about an hour ago... it helped moderately.   My dad is hating me more and more as I struggle more and more with this stuff.  And to top it off I don't even know if I have ADHD because my family won't let me get diagnosed.  Did I mention my exams are in four days?  Ahhhhhhhh.  /rant
