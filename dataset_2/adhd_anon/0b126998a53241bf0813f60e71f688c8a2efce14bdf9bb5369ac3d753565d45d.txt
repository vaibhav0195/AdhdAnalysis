I never knew it as ADHD, it was always, Bashfulbec is such a day dreamer, pay attention, stop fidgetting, you need to be better organised, pay better attention.   This continued into my adult life and followed me into my Bachelors where everything was left until the last minute, somehow I managed to graduate and somehow I have been in the same job for 13 years (I do enjoy it and it is pretty challenging). I'm going to be doing a Grad Dip of counselling in Feb.  I started to see a psychologist in July of last year for my OCD, he mentioned that he saw some symptoms of ADHD in me. I decided to explore and eventually I was diagnosed in December of last year. I have been on Ritalin since then and my god has it helped (not as irritable or reactive as I used to be and I seem to be able to follow through on things better now)   Before I was diagnosed, I was so excited to possibly be able to put a name to my brain. Now, after diagnosis, I feel a bit ambivalent and I find myself questioning it. is this a normal thing to go through?
