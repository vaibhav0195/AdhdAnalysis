This may sound a little weird but here is my situation (followed by the question itself).  I moved in the UK 2 years ago and am originally from Switzerland. My native language is french but I only speak in english since I moved here, apart with a few friends and my fiancee.  The thing is, despite the fact that I speak english quite well (I guess/hope), I struggle so much to retain information.  Typically at work, I have to write absolutely everything or else, I simply don't remember it. Same for the products we sell, I had to work a lot more than my colleagues because I simply didn't remember some characteristics of said products.   So, do you thinks this is ADHD related, or it's something that is perfectly normal for someone who doesn't speak his/her native language ?
