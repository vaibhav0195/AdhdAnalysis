I tend to be distant or slow to respond to conversations because I'm constantly being distracted by something the person is saying. I realize most of the time I'm in my own little bubble of contemplation and this is noticeable to others.  I have considered maybe I have OCD (it runs in the family), and if I wasn't always distracted by constant thought, I wouldn't suffer from these ADD symptoms. I would like to note that the thoughts I have are neither good, bad, nor obsessive. More so observations and analyzing.
