However, i don't remember feeling these symptoms until 10th standard. Could it be that my symptoms exploded during puberty? Or is it not ADHD then?

Strattera didn't help much. Then i was prescribed Methylphenidate. It was really effective but i felt a lot of emotional blunting(feeling less emotions, like a zombie, always engaged in my work) and a lot of sadness.  Dr Barkley says that ADHD is the most treatable disorder in psychiatry. But how are people able to tolerate such effects of such medications? I honestly can't do without medications but the thought of not being able to feel emotions and feeling low all the time doesn't help either.
