I first tried Straterra, didn't feel a thing, then I tried Concerta, nothing, then I was put on to Adderall, but it only keeps me up. My NP had me on 18mg of Concerta for two weeks, then 24mg for three weeks. Wasted a month to find out nothing happened. So she told me when she prescribed me the Adderall that if I didn't feel anything on 10mg, to take two of them a day for 20mg total. I went as far up as 30, in the interest of time, and that kept me up until 5am on two different nights(had to verify so did it twice). So I know what my optimal dose is of Adderall, but it didn't really help me focus or give me motivation. When I tell her this, where do you think this'll end up going? And if anybody has had the same resistance to these medications, have you found one that works and if so, what is it? I understand everybody responds differently, but considering we have the same resistances to these medications, it may be alright to assume we have similar brain chemistry so what works for you MAY work for me. Anyways, thanks for the feedback in advance. :)
