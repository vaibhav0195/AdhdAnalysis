When I was in high school people thought that they were better than me because their grades were amazing and I'd be lucky if I even scraped a pass. They looked at me like I was retarded, and on the rare occasion I studied and did better than them, they'd used to say stuff like, "I can't believe *she* did better than me".  I'm so sick of feeling like I can't accomplish anything because of literally being told my whole life that I would never accomplish anything.  I have so much work to complete by the end of the year. A normal person would be able to do it, but I don't feel that I can. I have no one in my life who actually cares for me other than my parents, and even then their love is conditional that I do well in my studies.  **TL;DR I guess you could say I'm looking for someone to chat with and support me. I have no life and only probably go out once a week. I want someone who understands what living with ADHD is like. I'd like someone who's online most of the time. I'm very needy, socially awkward, and not the best person right now... I hope talking to someone or having some sort of "friend" who can motivate me will help with my work.**
