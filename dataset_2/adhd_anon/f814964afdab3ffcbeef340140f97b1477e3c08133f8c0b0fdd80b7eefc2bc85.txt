f814964afdab3ffcbeef340140f97b1477e3c08133f8c0b0fdd80b7eefc2bc85;;;Got some answers &amp; today's my first day on Concerta;;;I don't know if I should tag this (or even how I do that) so I hope I didn't do anything wrong.  So I had my third visit with my psychologist on Tuesday night where she reviewed the results of all the questionnaires she gave me the week before. So I fall into the "diagnosable" range for ADHD-PI but I'm not off the charts or anything.  *(Side note: she said because of the way Ontario governs mental illness she couldn't give me an official diagnosis...she's a licensed psychologist specializing in ADHD and ADD so I'm not sure why that is and I didn't think to ask her, does anyone here happen to know WTF this means?)*  So we discussed some things I can do to help manage my symptoms and she suggested CBT in addition to medication (if I wanted to try medication) specifically to manage self-perception and self-esteem issues. I've used all my "counselling services" coverage for this year but it resets in January so I think I'm going to do that too.  Yesterday I went to my doctor and she prescribed me 36mg of Concerta for 2 weeks, then 54mg for 2 weeks following that. But of course my benefits will only cover the generic version of a drug if one is available, and not thinking, I didn't ask her to put "no substitutes" on my prescription and ended up with the Teva-Methylphenidate version without realizing it.  Anyway...took it about an hour ago, so it should kick in soon.  I'm scared it's not going to work, or I'll have some sort of bad reaction to it or something...this is basically the most medication I've ever been on in my life (I also started Wellbutrin last month) aside from short-term things when I was sick, so I'm nervous about how this is going to affect me. I can only hope that I won't experience terrible side effects and that it actually improves things.  So we'll see! I'm going to try and update this throughout the day with my observations.  Also...having this sub to turn to when I was doubting myself or my belief that I actually have ADHD has been so helpful. It's good to have reassurance that you're not alone and it's not all in your head, and to read other people's experiences. So thank you, everyone, for being here =)  **Update:** It's been a little over 2 hours since I took my first pill and I'm definitely feeling more alert and on-the-ball than I normally am mid-morning, especially considering I've only had like 2 sips of my coffee. For a little while my brain felt...fuzzy? I feel like that's the best way to put it. That last about 20 minutes and now it feels clear. This is encouraging! After all the stuff in the side effects about how it can affect your heart I was convinced I was just going to drop dead today because of it. But so far so good! I feel like I would need a higher dose for it to make a huge difference, but so far I'm liking how this is going.  **Update 2:** I feel like it's starting to wear off already...I took it 4 hours ago and for a while I was feeling pretty good: motivated and focused, at least more than I normally am although it wasn't like night and day or anything. Maybe it's just not a high enough dose or the crappiness of the generic version is really shining through.  Pro: no racing heart, no jitteryness, I don't feel hungry but I also don't feel nauseated, and no headaches!
