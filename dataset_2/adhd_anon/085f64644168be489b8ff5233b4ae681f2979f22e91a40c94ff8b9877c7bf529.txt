I have the HIGHEST dose of amphetamines I have ever seen...so tired. Advice?;;;Hey Reddit! I have been taking medication for ADHD for the past 8 years but I have found that *compared to those I have reached out to in person and you great people on the internet;* I am taking a dose that I am suspecting is NOT normal. For the last couple of months I have not been able to go to my physician as I lost my insurance. Not taking the medication has caused me to sleep like 18 hours a day but I am at a point now (6 MONTHS) later where I can sleep for 9 hours and feel 'just' tired. I remedy that by drinking a pot of coffee in the morning just to be functional. I just need to know if anyone else went through this withdrawl, this is just such a HUGEEE withdrawal.  My medication regimen for ADHD is as follows: ****  ADHD (Combined Type) ------------------------------- - Vyvanse 30ct [70mg] - 1/day  - Vyvanse 30ct [50mg] - 1/day - Adderall XR (Generic-BARR) - 60ct [30mg] - 2/day  - Adderall IR (Generic-BARR) - 60ct [10mg] - 2/day - Dextroamphetamine IR (Generic) - 60ct [10mg] - 2/day  **Note:** I am also taking medication for 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder' &amp; 'Panic Disorder' but I'm speculating that the aforementioned conditions are exacerbated by the ridiculous  amount of stimulant medication I am prescribed. These doses by themselves are not in/of themselves anything that deviates from what most would consider the norm regarding benzodiazepines.    Before my insurance ran out I took in addition to these meds: **** Major Depressive Disorder ---------------------------- - Lexapro - 30ct [20mg] - 1/day  ****  Residual High BP &amp; mild tachycardia [From ADHD Stimulant medications]  -------------------------------- - Propranolol LA (Brand)- 30ct [60mg] 1/day OR - Tenormin (Brand) - 60ct [20mg] 2/day  ****  Generalized Anxiety Disorder &amp; Panic Disorder *[See Footnote] --------------------------------- - Klonopin (Generic-Clonazepam) - 90ct [0.5mg] 3/day - Ativan (Generic-Lorazepam) - 60 ct [0.5mg] AS needed for PD - Xanax (Generic-Alprazolam) - 10 ct ONLY - **AS NEEDED for immediate panic attack.   Note: **Panic attacks are very far and few inbetween but since I have not been on the mediation I feel more physical side effects of anxiety as if my system is going through some kind of shock. I know self diagnosing is a dangerous game to play but I would go as far as honestly saying that I am developing strong agoraphobic tendencies. I have been trying to leave my condominium for some time for job interviews and the like but have not been able to get out of my head. I'm nodding off but I hope some kind soul lets me know I'll be ok. The lack of medications is killing me, I've tried a change in diet, exercise and such..Thanks in anticipation of some love.   TL;DR - No insurance anymore, system is going into literal shock from lack of medication. Panic, Depression, Major anxiety, Extreme apathy &amp; lethargy, REDIC amt of sleep. Wot do?  Edit 1: I posted in the wrong subreddit last time.  Edit 2: Clonazepam dosage was off.
