I, personally, envy the people who share what meds they take and what they switch to, etc. - not only they can get meds but they can even choose! Not even talking about the special conditions in the university...  So I'm interested in the people's lives with ADHD in other countries - how did you find your doctor? What is your treatment? What other people know about your condition and how do they take it? And everything else. Don't forget to add your country!  **tl; dr** non-americans: how is ADHD managed in your country?
