In reviewing my case,  he mentioned that generic Concerts is pretty much crap.  The reason: although "bio-identical"  the time release function of the generic is virtually nonexistent. That means that it spikes and fades over 6-8 hours, vs. giving you a 12 hour dosage.   This also explains why moving from 72-108mg made my heart race and why I tend to crash in the late afternoon. I'll be filling a new prescription tomorrow - for the real thing.   Something to think about if you take a generic time release med.   And for other Canadians here - Safeway offers Concerta at the generic price. They have some deal with the manufacturer, according to the shrink. Just FYI.
