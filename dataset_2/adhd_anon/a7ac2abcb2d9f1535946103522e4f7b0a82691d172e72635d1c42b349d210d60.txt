a7ac2abcb2d9f1535946103522e4f7b0a82691d172e72635d1c42b349d210d60;;;New here, need some guidance.;;;First of all, **im 17**. about five months ago **i went to a psychiatrist about my parents divorce** and after a few meetings and talking about my life she said that **she strongly believes i have ADHD**. i will often be told to do three things but forget two of them. i didn't think this was possible but she explained i have the **inattentive ADHD** and that that is the kind most parents blame on being lazy or forgetful.  i cant get back in contact with her for some reason, so im not sure where to go for this. so here is one of my questions,**where did you go to get tested or did you even get tested? can a GP or general practitioner/family doctor do the testing? will the doctor not believe that i have ADHD if i have made good grades in school?**  **also, has medication help'd you not space out, be able to read for more than a couple pages(for me this is the worst part because i get frustrated after a paragraph or two i am just reading the lines and often start thinking of something else)**  *TLDR*  *17, nervous about doctor visit and don't know where to go for ADHD testing or if even necessarily*
