So, I have been diagnosed as an adult, but I think I have "ADHD lite" or coping mechanisms that as long as my mental health is otherwise strong, pretty much makes life manageable. I take 10-20 micrograms of adderall every now and then, as needed... but not regularly.   I just started keto the other day (for weight loss) and realized that since I have started, I feel almost the same ability to focus and stability that the adderall gives me. I know I have seen posts relating to this in the past, but haven't found any scholarly/science-based posts/articles on this. Is it a "thing?" Is it just placebo?   I obviously don't think it's a substitute for medication or anything, but have been shocked at how it has improved my mood, focus, and how stable I feel. In a way it makes sense (blood sugar highs and lows certainly effect mood... but concentration?)... but I don't know if it is all in my head...  Thanks!
