I'm new to this subreddit, i no longer feel so alone anymore :) Sorry for broken English.   Me and my best friend, that also has ADHD, have been playing Lol with a strong passion for thousands and thousands of hours. We've found that our ADHD handicap us in certain areas.   So for you gaming geeks, what's your experience with competitive games and ADHD? Does it limit you in some aspects? Do you play best during night time? Does medication help? Can you come up with strategies to overcome problems caused by ADHD?
