169e00ea79a5cf3fdfd28379f9c96519b749867a208af2fedc2ab13f9db0fce3;;;I got asked this question, I was wondering if you guys had stumbled into the same problem?;;;background (short): - being a slacker, depression, bad breakup with gf i obsessed over lead to me getting kicked out.  - i get better, find out i have had adhd since grade 8 most likely, start treatment (meditation, books, and methylphenidate derivative), lose weight, become very fit, back in uni now.  - i also have developed better habits and social skills, lots of girls approach me now and frankly i feel like many are 'after me' lololol.   im a part of a club, and in a meeting one of the guys (and then one of the ladies) asked me why i dont have a girlfriend.  I had no answer.. I guess I don't feel like I could really share my life with someone without scaring them off? I can't even come up with a reason!  I would like to find a partner to share my life with, but I somehow feel unable.   Anyone out there experienced this?
