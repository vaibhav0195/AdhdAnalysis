(Yes, this is related to ADHD);;;Hey guys, new member of /r/ADHD and I have a question for you all. I've been recently diagnosed with ADHD-PI, but I gave myself a self-diagnosis of this months before. One of the reasons (besides inattentiveness, disorganization, etc.) was because of my **hand dominance**, or lack of. I'm **cross dominant**, which means I use my left hand for some tasks, and my right hand for others. It's so extreme that I often switch hands for similar tasks, like cutting with a knife left handed but spreading with a knife right handed, or holding a broom right handed but using it left handed. It's so varied that I was listed as ambidextrous in almost all hand dominance tests.  **Now the relevant part:** I've heard that mixed handedness, ambidexterity, and to some extent left handedness, is mostly common among people with ADHD (the reasons for why it does escapes me), and that people with these hand/feet/eye dominance issues are more likely (statistically significant, as one statistician put it) to have learning disabilities, difficulty learning languages, and learning math, than pure right handed people.  So, how many of you guys actually have this kind of dominance issue, and how has it affected you? If you did, was it inherited or totally out of the blue? I hope I'm not alone here :(  *TL;DR: Studies show cross dominance/ambidexterity is common in people with ADHD, can you guys relate?*
