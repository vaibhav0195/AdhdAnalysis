136d8431a7d9a2305c2a1aa135c004b19e68ae2554f1ee555279e32f5aef6391;;;what are some obstacles and solutions you have found with getting back in medicine with finding reputable treatment;;;My husband and I have both been diagnosed (before we met) Pursued treatment (adderal xr)  Met each other  Continued treatment decided to have children Moved have different insurance in different state (Ohio Medicaid Caresource)  I had no idea how many run arounds And obstacles  Seems like the only place that is covered is the  Place that does counseling for drug and alcohol addiction  First of all I forgot taking my medicine never abused it And my only addiction is pizza and sweets.  I've been hyper focused and obsessing in getting back on treatment (medicine)  In the past I had therapy on one side and O monthly well checks on adderal (Blood pressure and check ins to get my monthly prescription)   Ironically after denouncing medicine I have bowed down and had dinner with my demons  I need treatment and I can not fight the good fight any longer the  Financial debt and over due errands are so much that I really shutter to think where I will be  I'm a student a wife and a mother of a toddler and 2 month old  As I have more responsibilities now the solution is more obvious  But I am getting obstacles and calling places that make the appointment take and Bill the insurance then and only then say 1) You can't see a psychiatrist until a month and 2) we are not keen on prescribing stimulants for adult onset add  I do t know what onset is?!  Also a man masquerading even has a site about add you pay him make an appointment then he tells you he does not believe you need a stimulant   Well  Then  I am so far behind on my real responsibilities from dealing with these obstacles that I will need three more days to catch up on my mother wife and student and house stuff  Then I'll start over.   I'm wondering if I should just do self pay and private practice these places seem like they are totally against me and medicine.  Spent all day on phone looking for doctors
