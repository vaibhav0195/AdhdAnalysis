Sorry if my title sounds... clinical, or terse, I wasn't sure how to succinctly put what I wanted to ask.  &amp;nbsp;  So, last year, I was diagnosed as ADD (not ADHD, but I feel like a lot of the same symptoms apply and r/ADD is dead...) which was sweet because, in my head, it made so much sense.  "Woah, this is why I never finish anything.  This is why I can't concentrate.  This is why I... x, y, z."  You get the point.  My doctor said that its really common for females to go undiagnosed until later in life, because they're quiet and shy, and nothing seems wrong, for instance.  Also, in my case my step-brother was hella ADHD and by comparison I seemed like everything was hunky dory.  When there's him, riding his bike to school and then calling for rides because he forgot he had done so and misplacing all of his stuff all the time.    &amp;nbsp;  Anyways, I'm digressing here, my real question is this: my doctor gave me a little test to take, about 25 questions, to determine whether or not I qualified as ADD.  But when I took the test the questions asked had nothing to do with concentration problems and everything to do with sleeping patterns and stuff like that.  My doctor really didn't give me an explanation of what this  surveyed and I was wondering if anyone here had taken a similar rubric, and what something like that was actually measuring.   I also noticed that a lot of the questions repeated themselves in different ways.  But I have no idea what that means.  &amp;nbsp;  **TL;DR:** What type of test did your doctor administer to determine whether you were ADD/ADHD?
