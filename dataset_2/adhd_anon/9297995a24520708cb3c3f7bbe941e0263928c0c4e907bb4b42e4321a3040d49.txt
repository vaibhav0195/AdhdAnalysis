A big portion of my job is having periods of time where i have to do monotonous task. I used to put in ear buds, that would keep me on task by providing a light distraction to EVERYTHING else in my office. (cube farm)  The only problem is I was recently told by my boss no more head phones, even know others in the company have the opportunity to use them.   Do I tell my boss? Can I get fired for requesting to wear them? Should I "come out" as ADHD, no one knows there? Help. Please.
