As a kid I would always give teachers problems, and have a very hard time staying focused. Im in University now, and I do fairly well, but my grades for classes that require paying attention to the lecture are significantly lower, despite me being there. I try to pay attention but before I know it Im off on a whirlwind of though tangents. At work Ive always had a hard time learning things, because usually it required listening attentively. It makes me feel stupid and humiliated that Im usually one of the last people to catch on to things.   Anyway, I have an appointment set with my doctor friday, but Im kind of afraid of how he will react. I guess Im afraid that It will turn out that I dont have it and look stupid. So I guess my question is, what are the main characteristics of adult ADHD? For those diagnosed later in life what were the defining traits?
