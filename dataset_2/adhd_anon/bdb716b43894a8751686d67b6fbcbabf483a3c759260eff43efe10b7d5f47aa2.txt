bdb716b43894a8751686d67b6fbcbabf483a3c759260eff43efe10b7d5f47aa2;;;Constantly confused;;;I was just recently diagnosed last month and was prescribed Ritalin. I received my diagnosis via neuropsychological assessments (a bunch of IQ tests) and learned that I have a "superior" perceptual reasoning IQ. The neuropsychologist recommended that I use "visual" aids to study (I am in graduate school). I did very badly on the similarities test (low average), but got "superior" raw scores on vocabulary and information. Also did poorly on spelling and sounding out words. I was placed in speech class as a child so I am not "too" surprised. I was almost diagnosed with a learning disorder, but they re-evaluated the results and dropped it.  Anyway, since I started Ritalin I noticed something... When I'm on it, I don't feel as confused as I usually do. I just feel all over the place most of the time and I never noticed that this could've been ADHD. I do not understand why I am naturally a bit confused? I do not know if it's because I am distracted and am only "half" listening, therefore I am "missing" the important details (maybe).  My psychiatrist suggested that I've been operating on probably "60%" brain capacity, which was still enough to get by and do well in school until it became a "problem" in graduate school where I couldn't get by, by paying "half" attention. IDK. This is all very new to me...
