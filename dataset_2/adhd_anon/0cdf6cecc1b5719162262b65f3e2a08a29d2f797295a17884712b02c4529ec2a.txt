I am considering going to my school's accessibility services to ask about accommodations, but I learned my college's counseling center now offers something called "ADHD evaluation" for like $200. I did not have to pay $200 for what I did with the school psychologist. He had me fill out some paperwork and had my sister and best friend also fill out some paperwork. So I imagine this "evaluation" probably involves some actual testing.  I don't know if I'll be required to go through that for the accommodations or not. Their policy is really unclear about it. But if I do need it, well, I'm kind of nervous.  What happens during the testing? Do you like play a special game on a computer or something? Does a psychologist or psychiatrist listen to you talk? How do they determine whether you have ADHD or not?  It makes me nervous because I know there's no completely accurate, foolproof "test" for ADHD, and I've always been somewhat unusual. I've always been a high-achieving student and I actually do pretty well on tests. So I'm worried that they'd just see me doing well on whatever tests they have and decide that means I don't actually have ADHD or something. If I could just take them home with me and let them watch how I live and do things I think they'd get it, but no one ever thought I might have a problem as a kid because my academic performance was above average, and I'm worried that it'll be the same way with this evaluation, whatever it is.   So yeah, I don't know what to expect if it turns out I do need that. :\
