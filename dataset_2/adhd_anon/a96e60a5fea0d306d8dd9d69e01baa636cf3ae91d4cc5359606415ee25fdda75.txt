I was diagnosed with ADHD (PI) at the beginning of this year and was prescribed Ritalin 10mg of which I took two pills a day. This apparently improved my mood and made me a much better person in general, but it did not help me with my procrastination and focus issues.     I decided to try dexamphetamine (5mg) because my psych said if Ritalin doesn't work then the dexies will. So I've been taking my maximum 4 pills a day, but I am not noticing any effect at all.   I am still failing all my classes and I have no motivation, no focus and I procrastinate with EVERYTHING that doesn't involve food, tv or the internet. Even writing this right now is me avoiding my assignment.      I know the medication isn't going to fix all my issues and I have to eventually just man up and deal with them, but I still feel that the medication should at least be doing something and making it somewhat easier for me, which hasn't happened.       I even tried going to a psychologist for some counseling, but she didn't want to talk about the ADD and just gave contradictory advice several times through the session. My Psychiatrist is difficult to get a hold of and isn't of much help anyway besides being a human drug dispenser.       None of my friends or family have any experience with ADD so I don't know who else to talk to. Should I go back to Ritalin and up my dosage? There are no other drug options available in Australia. What else can I do?    **TL;DR** tried both medications available in Australia, neither seem to be helping. Psychologist unhelpful. Psychiatrist unhelpful. What can I do?  **EDIT:** Thanks for your advice everyone who replied. I think your comments have helped me realise which things I need to work on to get back on track.  * Find the right dosage of Ritalin * Fix sleeping pattern * Work on the bad behaviours I've learnt over the years. * Limit access to things which distract me so much.
