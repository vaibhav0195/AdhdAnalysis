d337fe0fc990f16f3b0743e1be8c19bb1bad0ea118f3b4b828856c8af0355916;;;How do Elvanse dosages compare to Vyvanse;;;Im 24, recently been diagnosed in the UK, my doctor says that he wants to wean me onto Elvanse before giving me the full recommended dose. Hes given me 50mg to take every day for 2 weeks before upping the dosage, but from reading this forum and others apparently thats alot?  He said that he will eventually increase the dosage to 100-120mg and according to some people here thats a fuck load.  I realise that most of the posts talk about Vyvanse which is the same chemical but different brand name but I was wondering how the dosages differ between countries (for when im reading about other peoples experiences to compare).  If it helps the bottle says "Each Capsule contains 50mg Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, equivalent to 14.8mg of dexamfetamine".  Thanks for any replies.
