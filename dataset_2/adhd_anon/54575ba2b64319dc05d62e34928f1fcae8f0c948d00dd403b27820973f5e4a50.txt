I'm unable to accomplish anything long term. I've really screwed my life up to the point that I can't afford medical insurance to go to the doctor. I can't afford doctors care out of pocket and I've already screwed that up because I owe my local doctor's office money from my last visit that I can't afford to pay. I can't hold a job and I'm unable to maintain any kind of relationship with anyone because I can't focus. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was a child. I'm not sure if that's why I can't focus as an adult or incapable of completing any long term goals. I think I may need some kind of meds to fix or maybe just cover up the problem so I can focus and get things done. I've really wasted a lot of my life and am almost at a point where I won't be able to earn enough to retire. I've notice the wear and tear on my body and realized that I won't be able to work forever. I also need things like health insurance so I can go to the doctor if I get sick instead of just sitting at home and waiting it out. We don't have a free clinic anymore which they wouldn't help me with my ADHD problem. They said I needed to see a specialist whom I owe money.   I try so hard to make myself focus but it tires me out. I end up being mentally screwed half way though the afternoon. Then I just sit there in a daze for the rest of the day not able to do anything. I've always been this way. I just don't know how to get help when I can't afford it.
