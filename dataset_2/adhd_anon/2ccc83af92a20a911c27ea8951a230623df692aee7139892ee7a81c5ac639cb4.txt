They want another evaluation!;;;In January my psychiatrist suggested I get tested. My ins doesn't cover it so I went to a local university where I have been through three separate evaluations, starting in February. Two weeks ago I had what I thought was the last appointment. They told me a report would be written, it would be approved by the professor, then I would have another appointment to come discuss the results. I have provided school records from kindergarten to college, surveys from my sister, ex husband, self, and a close friend. I took a lot of assessments. Lots of shit.   Today I got a call from them saying there were some missing pages from my surveys and I needed to come redo one of them. They also want to do some other evaluation because I had a previous diagnosis of anxiety.   I'm a 37 year old female. I have never identified with anything more intensely than I do with the symptoms of ADHD that I have been learning about over the last few months. I'm so frustrated and feel like nobody cares.   Edit-- My psychiatrist appointment is today, in about five minutes. I don't have the report of course but I'll see what the doctor says. Does anyone else ever find that you have a ton of things to tell your doc and then when you get to the appointment you just sorta space out and can't pull together anything you wanted to say??
