Low motivation, lack of interest in things. But I've also noticed I cannot focus very well. My working memory and attention span are not so great. It has become very difficult for me to focus on my work (programming software).  I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 7 and prescribed ritalin. I went off the meds at 11 years old because I was sick of being bullied for taking "mental pills" etc. I am now 23 (male).  The fluoxetine and citalopram SSRIs I've tried have some bad side effects (muscle tension, anorgasmia, low libido) and they have not helped with the concentration. My mood is lifted but I still find myself unable to sleep after an unproductive day at work. I am fairly close to losing my job.   This seems to happen with just about every new challenge I take up. I can stick at it for a while (~6months) and it then becomes boring and I simply cannot focus on it. I get distracted easily, but I wouldn't say I'm hyperactive.  Obviously depression and insomnia are also causes of these work problems. It's hard to isolate one condition from the other. My doctor seems to be in favour of treating the sleep/depression first, but so far this has not been working. I am seeing a psychiatrist tomorrow, so hopefully I can get a prescription. However I thought I would get a second opinion on weather this is the right way to solve my problems.  **Is there anyone here who is now on Ritalin (or similar meds)** and has been through a similar process. Did it help your productivity and life in general.   **tl;dr** Can't focus at work, depression meds (SSRIs) not working, had ADHD as a child. Would Ritalin help me focus?
