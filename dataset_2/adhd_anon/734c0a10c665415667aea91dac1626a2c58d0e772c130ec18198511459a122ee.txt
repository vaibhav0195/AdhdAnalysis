Most of us are aware of the insanely high correlation between sleep and ADHD (used to be a diagnostic criteria).   I'm especially interested to hear from people who have an official diagnosis and exhibit ALL of the following:  * Fall asleep within 15-20 minutes of laying down * Stay asleep (with the exception of getting up to use the bathroom) * Don't snore on any level (even a little) and don't experience restless leg issues * Under typical conditions, FEEL REFRESHED upon waking * Feel "awake" during the day with maybe a minor dip in the afternoon (which is pretty normal) * Have trouble with executive functioning, but don't feel "tired"/"sleepy"
