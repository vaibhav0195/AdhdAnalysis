But I'm wondering if that's due to unrealistic expectations.  I've just started Vyvanse (taking 40 mg) and...something's different. There's a small boost to my focus on individual tasks and motivation to complete them, and even if I still get diverted easily there's a bit more resistance on some level to just careening off in new directions. But some days, like today, I feel the stimulant more than anything.  I guess I was hoping for the sort of life changing transformation some people describe with their first medication, and I'm worried I may have dismissed some of the other meds too quickly when I didn't get those results. I'm trying to be mindful now and work with the Vyvanse, rather than expecting it to do all the work.
