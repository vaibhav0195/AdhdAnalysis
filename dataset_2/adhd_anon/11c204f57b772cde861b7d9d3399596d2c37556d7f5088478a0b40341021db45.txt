Wondering about others in the medical field and how it affects your job.  I now know why it's so hard for me to get everything done at work. And why my colleagues make it looks easier, thus making me feel incompetent.   3 years ago I was told I should be evaluated for ADD by my manager and the Chief Intensivist due to poor performance and to help secure my job. I saw a psychiatrist and psychologist and was told I had "low focus" and co-dependency but not ADD.   Now, I've been diagnosed by my therapist who is familiar with the differences of ADD in Women and just by telling her about my job and issues, she said it sounded just like it. After reading about Women and ADD, it hit me like a ton of bricks. I fit the description 100%. My life and it's idiosyncrasies suddenly make sense now. I cried my eyes out when I figured it out because life could have been so much easier 3 years ago. Fucking "professionals".   I just don't know who talk with about it , other than my husband and therapist. I have a strong urge to tell everybody to explain why I'm awkward and weird. That might make it worse though. ;)
