I just did my first couple days and it's changed me completely! My role makes me feel so important, and I love seeing the genuine appreciation in those I've helped. It's truly heartwarming and has inspired me to always go above and beyond in everything that I do!   I've always been a person of giving. And with so many opportunities of helping others, I've definitely reinforced that part of me.   It's been such a fulfilling duty at the hospital that I am truly overwhelmed with joy and love what I do!    Just before then, I was diagnosed with ADHD. This diagnosis has helped me to focus to improve on my weaknesses and really put a conscious effort into self improving. I really emphasize on having an intrinsic desire to continually work towards what kind of person you idealize as the kind you want to be.  It starts with your imagination there. Ask yourself questions to things you're unsure about and answer them to the way you'd like things to be. Then set yourself to go for it!   I've never been happier with my newfound passion of giving to others and with advancing in my career. And it's also been my outlet for stress.    I've finally found what I love and I hope you do too. It all started in changing my attitude and being as positive and warm as I can, at every opportunity!   Also, by continually stepping out of my comfort zone with confidence. Do everything you do with confidence, and if you don't think you have it then force yourself to bring it out of you. It's there if you make it there. And it's one of the key steps that has rewarded me so much in self improvement!   I would love to hear your stories! What are some of your aspirations in life, and how do you plan to achieve them?
