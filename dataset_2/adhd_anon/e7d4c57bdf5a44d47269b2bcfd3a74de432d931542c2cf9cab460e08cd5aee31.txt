e7d4c57bdf5a44d47269b2bcfd3a74de432d931542c2cf9cab460e08cd5aee31;;;Just Started taking Vyvanse, Anxiety hits when it wears off. Suggestions on how to deal with it?;;;Last week I was finally offically diagnosed with ADHD, at least the "D" part, and the doctor started me on Vyvanse. When it is working, it works great! After about 12-13 hours, it seems to fully wear off and while it is- I have rather strong anxiety. It's like my negative emotions are really magnified.   I find that today, I am worrying about the anxiety itself, because I have a family history of family who acted poorly nad abuseivly. I don't want to head down this route myself (Something I have always worried about.) So, my question is simply- how do I correctly deal with the emotions effectively? Usually I can just shut them out, but it seems this is not a solution anymore.   Any help at all is appreciated, I've started (today) to take a journal to better understand when this hits so I can talk to the doctor about it if I need to, and to know when I can't trust myself so I don't do something dumb.  Thanks again for any reply.
