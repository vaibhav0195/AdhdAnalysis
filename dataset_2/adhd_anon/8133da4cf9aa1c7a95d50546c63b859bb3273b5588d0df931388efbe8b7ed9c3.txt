I don't necessarily feel it's very nice to point out people's symptoms/faults. Should I just tell her? How? Or should I not? She seems to be doing fine except for the studying problems.  She has constantly rejected my attempts to befriend her so my plan to subtly introduce it to her by getting to know her have pretty much failed.  Have you had any positive experiences telling people about their potential adhd? I've told several people in the past and I don't think it's been helpful to them.
