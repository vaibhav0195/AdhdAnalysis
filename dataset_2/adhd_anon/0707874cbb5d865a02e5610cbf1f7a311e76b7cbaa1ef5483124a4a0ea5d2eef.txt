I'm a college student, but I'm worried about failing out. I'm mostly a lurker on here because of social anxiety that makes even talking to people online difficult.   I have been diagnosed with ADHD-PI as well as some other LDs a few months ago and have started on Ritalin 10 mg x2 day. I am also taking Celexa after trying a few other SSRI's that made me suicidal/feel worse. I am also dealing with moderate-severe depression and ongoing anxiety that I've had since I was literally 4.  Because of these issues, I've turned to nicotine (smoking, now converted to vaping) to help me focus. I have no motivation because of my issues and my grades are absolutely horrendous. I am so tired of nothing working. Nicotine works in the short term, but my short term memory and working memory seem nonexistent most days.   Is there anything I can do to alleviate my issues besides trial and error with medication? I know I need to tackle one thing at a time, but I'm just so frustrated about my grades, social life...basically everything is in the trash. I have a hard time making friends because of anxiety, have a hard time keeping said friends because of depression (hard to even get out of bed) and I just can't concentrate on anything. I don't know who to turn to. Neither Celexa nor Ritalin seem to be helping me. I feel like I'm going to be stuck forever and never be successful.  TL;DR: Depressed, anxious with ADHD/some other LDs. Struggling in college academically and socially. My motivation is at -1 and nothing is working. What can I do?
