I alway work out how much i was able to going to get for the paper. I worked out all the awnsers that i am 100% certain and the awnsers that i am not sure of and i avoid countimg the marks that i geused. I estimated me getting about 90-96 %. I am usually quite spot on with my estimates. Today i got too school and i found out my best freind got a 100% for his paper. I was glad for him tilli foundout that the math teacher also tutor about 3 children in the klass and in the lesson beforaney exam she goes through the actual papper with them and give them all the awnsers. I got so mad when i heard that my friends girlfreind went and told him what he must studys and everything, thats why he got a 100% for the paper. I know i am complaining over nothing but i got congratulated for my 80% (witch for me is a sh*t mark) i got soo mad...
