Specifically in Canada;;;I've recently been diagnosed as ADHD and so far have paid about $1K of $2K for the service. I was hesitant to sign up, but it's a life changing thing to figure out so I decided I needed to do it.    After going through the process I started to feel I was being taken by scammers:  * they are incentivized to test positive  * the doctor's time is paid for by Canadian health insurance, so this is basically private healthcare (and the operators are sitting on a hen that lays golden eggs)  * I asked if they could reduce the price and they insisted they could not. They  outlined their business model which in my interpretation amounted to "the market supply/demand curve indicated that ~$2K is what someone will pay for diagnosis &amp; treatment so we'll charge that and provide some other services to make the cost seem fair".   * They then told me to use more of the services to get my money's worth. I had already explained that I'm reasonably successful as a person and the only piece missing is medication (and that part is paid for by OHIP).  * I figure I've taken maybe 4hrs of their time so I pay them ~$250/hr and they (other than the doctor) don't do much in this time  * I asked if I could see the doctor directly, but he has closed his clinic   Am I right to feel I'm being taken by scammers? Should I just pay the gatekeepers to get the treatment?  TL;DR:   is &gt;$2k too much for ADHD treatment? (just diagnosis and medication tweaking, not the medication itself).   Can anyone recommend good ADHD clinics in Toronto (specifically for adults)?
