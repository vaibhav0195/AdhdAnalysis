Last year I decided to make an experience abroad because I've found this occasion after my graduation when I was still looking for a job in my country. It can be said that this was for me the first real experience abroad and most of all away from my parents. The first months were really tough because of my lack of practice in the use of the english language, but I tried to stay committed and I started to stick with a plan that I devised on purpose in order to overcome this weakness. It wasn't easy, I started to read a lot of books in english language and day by day I managed to improve my abilities. However, I realized that I have struggled a lot in order to maintain my concentration on a single book, in fact instead of being a pleasant activity has been really perceived as a duty that has to be done. This gave rise also to a series of issues like depression and anxiety that weren't allowing me to sleep a proper amount of time, and being able to be functional especially in social contexts. I should say that I wasn't a social animal also when I was in my country, However that was something that wasn't concerning me that far. In the workplace I felt always really frustrated not only because of the linguistic gap, but also because people around me were able to handle all the tasks in an easier way than mine. Up until now I didn't manage to have an assessment for ADHD, but I guess that I should actively looking for it because it's something that is keeping me down the more the time is passing by. The question is: How did you discover that you were dealing with ADD/ADHD?
