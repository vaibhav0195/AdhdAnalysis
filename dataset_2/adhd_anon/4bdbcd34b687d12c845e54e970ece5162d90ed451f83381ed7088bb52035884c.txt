I don't mean like, using some tool to change the text color to yellow around the important parts. I mean like, as I'm reading it, I constantly use my cursor to highlight around where I'm reading and unhighlight it involuntarily, probably at a rate of about 6 times every 5 seconds.  I was diagnosed with ADHD-PI and didn't really experience any symptoms of ADHD-PH before diagnosis, but I also seem to fidget and whatnot now that I'm on stimulant medication. It's not really a problem - it doesn't keep me from focusing or disturb those around me - I just find it interesting. Has anyone else had a similar experience?
