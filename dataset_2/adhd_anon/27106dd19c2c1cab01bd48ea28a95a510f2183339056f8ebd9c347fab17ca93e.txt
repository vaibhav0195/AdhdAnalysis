What are reasonable expectations?;;;I'm just starting to work with a psychiatrist again for ADHD. This time, the medication we started with is a lot better than what I took when I tried this years ago, so I think I'm on the right track.  At the same time, I'm not all the way there I think. I can focus on 75% of the lecture instead of 40%. I used to average 30 minutes of work for every 1 hour browsing the internet. Now it's more like 2 hours work to 45 minutes of browsing.  I'm hoping I can catch all of a lecture and work pretty continuously without getting distracted. Is that too high of expectation?
