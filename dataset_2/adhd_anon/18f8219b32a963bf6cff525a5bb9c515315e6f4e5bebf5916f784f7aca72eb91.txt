18f8219b32a963bf6cff525a5bb9c515315e6f4e5bebf5916f784f7aca72eb91;;;SO I just started with an ADHD Coach yesterday...;;;So I'm not really sure what to expect. The first session was just getting to know each other I guess, and she seems very nice, understanding, and informed. What should I expect? anyone else out there seeing a coach? What should I bring to the table? I've been taking notes on my day to day life for her .... i guess that's okay....  TL;DR ADHD Coaching, what do?
18f8219b32a963bf6cff525a5bb9c515315e6f4e5bebf5916f784f7aca72eb91;;;ADHD and Resume building?;;;So I have finished high school 10 years ago, I've dropped out of university twice and college once, and I have an eclectic list of jobs as long as your arm. Currently I'm trying to save up money for a house with my S.O. but my job doesn't pay enough and I'm trying to build a decent looking resume to get hired in a 9 to 5 Monday to Friday sort of deal... I have some office experience, I've done taxes at H&amp;R Block, as well as worked in retail, but predominantly I'm a waitress -and a mediocre one at that. This leads me to my problem, when I'm writing my resume I feel rather... unqualified and slightly inferior. The resume ends up deleted and reworked and deleted and reworked time after time, leaving me with nothing to pass around to potential employees. I need to get this DONE so I can pay off my student loans and help my man get that house we want! I feel like nothing I put down on paper about my employment history is good enough.... any sources out there for resume writing that are adhd friendly?  **TL;DR**   **ADHD leaves my resume unwritten due to feelings of inferiority and high levels of perfectionism. Need help, sources or advice.**   **................................................................................................................................**  **Update**:   Thanks to everyone for the advice, I got some great perspective and 2 really promising websites. I've been working day and night shifts for the past few days, and now I'm off for the weekend. That means that no matter what, it's resume crunch time! I'll let ya'll know how it goes!
