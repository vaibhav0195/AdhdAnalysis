4f0ff2f708c0142b4c76db0a8a19be6476c00d2dfc872d87f83a8c7c63b0d53f;;;I lost my written perscrptions. I'm terrified. What do I do?;;;Has anybody else ever lost their perscrptions?  What happened?      Background/history-im 19, the oldest of 3, a 2nd year college student and was diagnosed with ADHD 9 months ago.     In my first semester of college; poor grades, two heart surgeries, parents got a divorce and my sister spiraled into depression.    Last January I suspected I had ADHD, I was diagnosed and have been routinely taking my medication and I am seeing a counselor.    I chose to transfer schools my spring semester, started medication and my GPA went from a 2.3 to a 3.5.  ____   I lost my 3 months worth of written perscrptions last week. I've searched everywhere.    ___        I called my doctors office and they told me there isn't anything they can do . They said it's my fault I lost them and that I have to wait until November to get new written perscriptions.      I'm honestly terrified.    Ive been without medication this semester (3 weeks) and already i can tell that everything is bad. I dropped a few classes so I'm only taking two..and even that is too much.      I'm hoping that I can get this figured out.  What are you experiences with losing written perscriptions?   Any advice for me..? I'm scared and stressed.
