1b87fedd04caa9d19d25d3acee7f385db63eab40bae3709c6c502438aba28941;;;Currently on trial medication, got a REALLY important interview for university on friday. Should I go medicated or unmedicated?;;;Currently taking Concerta XL 18-mg which might not seem like much. This was just for the trial period which also happens to be ending on friday.       The course I'm applying to is design engineering at one of the more prestigious colleges, and from what I've seen theyre currently taking on the most passionate students(towards the course).      Without medication, Im just looking around, hard to maintain eye contact, and fidgeting, but I will go on and on about the topic, and keep the conversation interesting.   &gt; Ie : "so tell me about what you did in X" "So, in my college we have x and y. X is the more practical side, y is the more theory side. Now with Y, we were meeting with Z to learn about D. With X on the other hand we.............................(go on about it)" .. You get the idea    I haven't tried having a practice interview with medication, but I feel like it might make me less likely to go rambling, which can be a good thing as I would answer the question they ask me directly, no bullshit, but on the other hand this might be regarded as lack of enthusiasm, or something along these lines. I have noticed it can make me more chatty, but at the same time Ive noticed it making me quite boring and focused on one topic, refusing to change conversation topic.       I hadnt thought about this and simply thought Id go into the interview medicated to appear more professional, but since this is a creativity and STEM driven course Im not sure, and I think its a bit late to contact my psychologist, so Im looking for help here.     Thanks in advance.      TL;DR Really important interview for creativity/science and maths driven university degree. Meds make me more focused but Im not sure if that would be what is needed in this. Might appear unenthusiastic
