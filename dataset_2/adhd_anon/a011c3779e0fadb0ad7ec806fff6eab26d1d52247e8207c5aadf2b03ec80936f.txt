And I've noticed that a lot of the material I've found about ADHD presumes that things like distractibility and disorganization and not giving consequences too much thought are mostly negative and that one must find strategies and medications to notably reduce these. But I feel ambivalent about this.  On one hand I can increasingly see that these aspects of ADHD help lead to unhelpful outcomes for me, like not being able to find the will to seek out a career or job that I would like better.  But at the same time I think I find satisfaction in being somewhat flighty, undisciplined, inefficient, nonlinear, and slightly immature for my age. It can be very positive impulsively mixing the theoretically more important and going off on random tangents; and you can even find some unexpectedly useful things that way. I'm tempted to see some of this as a positive aspect of who I am, even as it can be a bit absurd. Some of these ADHD things I think I might even want to put into a list of my core values.  Is this familiar to anyone? I'm not sure how to resolve the paradox of valuing aspects of myself that are also in some ways undermining myself. Regarding my own particular case, I have trouble seeing it entirely as a disorder that needs treatment, even though things seem clearly to not be going as well as I might hope.
