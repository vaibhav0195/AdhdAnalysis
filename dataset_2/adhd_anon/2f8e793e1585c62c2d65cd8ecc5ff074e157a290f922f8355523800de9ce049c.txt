Food makes me lose my focus! :(;;;I've been diagnosed and medicated for a few months now (Adderall XR 10mg + Adderall IR 5mg booster as needed), and while it's been working wonders for my symptoms, I've been having some trouble when it comes to food.  Fortunately, I have had no reduction in appetite whatsoever while medicated, and I've been eating just as much as I always have-- except, It seems that the effects of the Adderall seem to go downhill quickly after I eat a regular-sized meal. I know that acidic foods inhibit absorption, so I'm careful not to combine the two, but this seems to be an entirely different problem.  My medication works best when I take it on an empty stomach in the morning (or after having eaten very little). But even if I've given it plenty of time to absorb first (an hour or more), my focus goes downhill quickly after I eat-- especially when I eat protein- or fat-heavy meals, and I feel sluggish and start to zone out. Eating very light, carb-based meals makes me feel cranky (and hungry!) by the day's end, but it seems to be the only thing that doesn't affect my medication. Strangely, I've heard other people saying the opposite-- that carbs make them lose their focus (which makes sense, with a sugar crash and all), so I don't really know what to make of this. Occasionally I will take a 5mg IR booster in the afternoon, and while this often helps, it still seems highly dependent on the amount of food I have in my stomach.   Has anyone had this problem? Any ideas? I hate feeling like I have to go hungry in order to get the full benefit of my medication. :(
