5ed274ba3b5d76018e3d7886d712bfb574acd1f367c06b9cf23a960133aa17da;;;question about med timing and work;;;I just started taking vyvanse 10mg today, such a low dose because exams are coming soon and i apparently shouldent be introducing new substances so close to exams. But usually every friday and saturday i start work between 5-7 pm and end around 9-12 pm so im pretty sure my dose will be worn off by then if i take it at 9 am. So i was wondering if i should take my dose later in the day so it will last through my work night?
