What was your before and after experience off and week on meds?;;;My diagnose has been a long time coming and I'm currently failing uni without meds. But I'm really not sure what to expect out of the meds and I'm to be honest a bit scared. I've always noticed that I was a bit peculiar and getting a diagnose has made me understand myself a bit better. But I'm still anxious. So to put it simple how has your experience been so far?
