Did you select different/less demanding work? Really up your structure? Was it worth it?   Background: I'm 1 week into a return to medicating my ADHD. I was on ritalin as a kid for awhile, but hated the zombie-like side effects and begged my parents to let me not take it. When my grades were ok and only my behavior was crappy, they agreed. Guess I was smart enough to get by (at least in public schools). I returned for a re-diagnosis in college and was on and off adderall from then and through grad school, taking long stints off of meds only to have to go through the entire doctor dog and pony show again each time. I just hated the side effects: thirst (ok dry mouth), sweaty palms, headaches, and of course the sleep issues (I already have some insomnia/issues staying asleep and take low dose trazadone to help me get more than 4 or 5 hours). So here I am, back again. This time on 30mg of Vyvanse. So far it's MUCH better than my experiences with straight adderall. I still have the sweaty hands and thirst, but considerably less crash and a much longer arch of effecetiveness. I just reached a point where I was spending 1/2 my work time goofing off and paying dearly for it, and losing things, and generally being flaky, which is not my personality really. I'm just trying to figure out if I want to deal with the side effects, constant doctor visits &amp; medication adjustments etc. for the long haul. It really makes a difference, but is also a lot of effort.    edit: grammar/clarification
