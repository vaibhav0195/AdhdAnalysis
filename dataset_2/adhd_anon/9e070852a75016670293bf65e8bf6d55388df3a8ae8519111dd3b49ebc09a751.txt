I think maybe there's another explanation.**  We've started the process of getting my 13-year-old diagnosed. She was tested and diagnosed with ADHD when she was six, with the main problem being 0% impulse control. We're getting a second opinion now, since she's so much older. It appears that testing will cost around $4,000 if insurance doesn't cover any of it.  The newest thing is that my daughter has told me &amp; now told her school counselor that she hears a voice named Rose who tells her what to do.  *(Rose is the name she wanted to call herself for years when she was little, and she named many of her dolls Rose. Also, if it helps, she loves ghost stories.)*  A quick google told me that many adolescents say they hear voices, so I haven't been too concerned. The school counselor is freaking out.  **This is my interpretation:** I think the "voice" is her way of reconciling with herself behavior that she feels she can't control but is deeply ashamed of. Maybe it is some personification of how she wants to act versus how she's trying to act. Either way, to me it signals that she really does need help with the impulse control now. Beyond that I'm not worried about it in terms of really serious mental illness or anything.  In the meantime I guess I would like to draw on the huge collective experiences here.  **Is this the sort of thing a struggling ADHD kid might do to deal with her feelings about her own behavior?** She is a very tender-hearted kid who really wants to do the right things and is maybe overly empathetic with others. I view her as feeling maybe out of control or unable to do the right things, even if she wants to.
