After insistence of my partner with ADHD, encouragement from a therapist, and painfully relating to this subreddit, I had an appointment with a psych.  The interview lasted maybe 30 minutes, we talked about previous medication (anti-depressants and mood stabilizers) that had no effect on me, or caused emotional blunting but never helped my mood swings and focus.  He was very thorough in explaining the effects of the drugs and selected Vyvanse as it was the first one to show up as covered under my insurance. He wasn't sure if there'd be an issue with age (some don't want to cover until 23, I'm 22) or said there may be a pre-authorization, but I had no issues!  30mg. Went home, took it. In about fifteen minutes I noticed a subtle shift in perception.  Colors were a little brighter as I felt sort of pushed more presently into my body.   Agitation I've been feeling for as long as I can remember suddenly became non-existent. My anxiety dropped from 7.5 to 2.5.   I didn't feel euphoric, but I felt calm. A subtle, almost drowsy sensation (not quite, I wasn't actually tired), that I realize is feeling peaceful.  My resistance was hardly there. For boring tasks or usually high stress irritations. Small frustrations hardly made a wave, when some days they could send me spiraling into aggression and an emotional shutdown.  The loud loops of conversations and idle chatter in my brain switched off, as if someone had turned the dial on a static-filled station slowly down and then off.  I felt normal. My brain was quiet for the first time in forever.   **Positive effects:**  quiet mind, more decisive, large decrease in anxiety (physical and mental), increase in ability to focus, lessened irritability/aggression, feeling more in the moment, easier to deconstruct normally complex problems into specific parts, lessened resistance to work/difficult tasks, lack of appetite (didn't obsess over food)   **Not so positive:**  desert-dry mouth, nausea, problems completely falling asleep (my mind would rest, my body kept waking me up)    **TL;DR**  First time on meds was a HUGE success, and I'll be following up in a month. I don't feel hopeless anymore, especially about the future! Biggest issue was sleep but I took my meds at noon (I work past 10pm) so I'll be trying a little earlier each day and seeing if that helps. It wasn't so much I was restless, more like my mind would drift to sleep and then I'd be nudged back into consciousness. Dry mouth is ridiculously noticeable, and I hate the nausea, but it's a small price to pay for all the benefits.    **End notes:**  I hope it continues to go well!  If anyone has any questions or can relate, please comment. I feel like my life finally makes sense and I owe it to this subreddit for helping me realize I most likely had ADHD and could get help.    **Question:**  How did you know it was time to raise the dosage of your medication? Will they begin to work less effectively, and what exactly would that entail?
