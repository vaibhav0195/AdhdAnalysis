9f0ace6cf92d4ddd123dfb037d83603edfd6160d2e3ff1f52dde201a55166fd8;;;Excellent book on ADHD and addiction;;;Those of us with ADHD are neurochemically predisposed to addiction.  Not just to drugs and alcohol but to behaviors like addictive gaming and binge eating.  We feel powerless to control our pathological behavior.  I highly recommend the book ["When Too Much Isn't Enough: Ending the Destructive Cycle of ADHD and Addictive Behavior"](https://www.amazon.com/When-Too-Much-Isnt-Enough/dp/1576836312/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1484422657&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=when+too+much+isn%27t+enough)  It's a quick read and helps explain biologically why we are prone to this type of behavior as well as how to overcome it.  *note: I was diagnosed a year ago at age 29, so this book was especially helpful in differentiating what behaviors are due to ADHD versus other factors.
