We spent most of my childhood battling with my teachers about it which made school very difficult. I have been told I am also an intelligent person and have recently gotten a nice hold over my ADHD. But unfortunately I do have my days where it is extremely difficult to focus on even the smallest of tasks in front of me, with finals coming up I am worried that I might have one of the days where I can't focus. Is there anything you would recommend to help me focus on these type of days?

On Monday July 2nd 2012, I was sworn into the United States Marine Corps. And it is all too fitting that Win Wednesday falls on the 4th. Although I was never officially diagnosed with ADD or ADHD, it was pretty clear to me that I suffered from some form of the two. Waiting down at the MEPS(Military Entry Program Services) was long, boring, and mentally painful. But I did it, I buckled down long enough to focus when I needed to between the hours of 7 AM until around 5 PM. I did have a lot of trouble focusing on the ASVABS, but I did get an 86. Overall I am proud of the attention I gave my Liaisons, the Doctors, and the officers in the building. Hopefully my control will get even better while I wait to graduate high school and get ready for boot camp. I am 17 years old, and I am in the Delayed Entry Program for the United states Marine Corps! OORAH and Semper Fidelis. PS Happy Independence Day!
