I've been seeking treatment for ADHD-PI since I was diagnosed 4 years ago. In that time I've taken Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse, and Strattera, among about a dozen other medications for anxiety, depression, and bipolar 2. At my worst I took 100mg of Adderall IR and noticed literally no effect.  Today I talked to my psychiatrist and asked about treating my ADHD symptoms again. She said she literally did not know what to do. She prescribed me Daytrana but no pharmacy within 50 miles of me has it or is able to get it.  Anyways. I've only ever been able to find scattered posts about people saying "same" with no real substantial suggestions. I don't really know what to do at this point. My ADHD has basically taken everything from me.
