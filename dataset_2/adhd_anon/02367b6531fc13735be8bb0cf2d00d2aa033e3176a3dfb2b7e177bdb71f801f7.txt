Luckily, I was diagnosed as a child but never received treatment. Now that I'm old enough to make my own decisions, I've decided to get on meds. I got a script for adderall xr 20mg today and I can't wait to try it out tomorrow! I knew this subreddit would understand my excitement and I needed to share it with someone! I also want to let you know that I probably wouldn't have sought out help if it weren't for everyone of your moving stories! I don't know y'all, but I love y'all!
