5cef47720ac0fa59e0a0b596b1039afc13b3d172cdec4e6da9dfd288571a69da;;;Too many numbers...;;;hey guys. so i recently started college for the 3rd time. now finally being diagnosed im starting to realize things...like me and SEEING numbers dont mix. currently i am taking statistics and these data sets are killing me...numbers EVERYWHERE. i spend 5 minutes arranging numbers to their correct place just to fuck up the whole problem because an unexpected number appears or i write 24 instead of 34. just random things that are so minuscule but can turn your entire problem wrong. now see, i know, "take ur time, read the numbers, check them off when u dont need them anymore, etc" HOWEVER i do all these things but my data sets are still screwed. im so sad because stats is the only math i find incredibly easy.......  anyways is this adhd related or is this dyslexia??? i dont have problems with words (anymore at least). i dont remember why i couldnt read property when i was a kid to be honest.  if this is adhd related, what the hell do i do? i really want to go into the science field and i feel like i didnt do well in math because i mixed up numbers quite often.
