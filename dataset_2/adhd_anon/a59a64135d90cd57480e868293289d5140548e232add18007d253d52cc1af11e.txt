My day flies by so much faster on days where I take the medication and just plods along on days I do not.   I was curious about if any of you have noticed similar things. I know there have been various studies that have looked at the impacts of things like cocaine and marijuana on the perception of time so it is certainly not out of the realm of possibility.   Edit: seems to be a split between some experiencing time moving faster on meds and some experiencing it moving more slowly.  If you experience either of these please share what meds you take if you are comfortable with doing so and we can see if there are any commonalities between those in each group.
