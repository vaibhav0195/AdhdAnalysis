28bb98f2b3d46ce752fa58320682ff1ff9a1e4b94a5f00beaa5b20ba03995c5d;;;I need help! I have fucked up my life so badly. Everything has fallen apart. I cant even complete simple tasks anymore. I am so overwhelmed.;;;I am 34, unemployed, almost homeless, friendless, I feel like I am a financial burden on my mom and stepdad, (just moved back home).  I am sick of the struggle. I just want to be able to be independent and take care of my own life.   I obviously need to get a psyc evaluation and start there. I have been on meds twice before and it helps, but I felt like both of my previous doctors just put me on meds and expected me to just magically be a healthy productive member of society.   how do i get free medical help in california?  How can I find a job where I wont burnout?  How the fuck do I learn to do normal things like pay by bills on time and brush my teeth every day?   I can build habbits, but then something shiny comes along and I forget about them.  I just want to find a simple SUSTAINABLE way to live on my own.  TL;DR:will I ever have a chance at being independent. FUCK I HATE MY LIFE!!!
