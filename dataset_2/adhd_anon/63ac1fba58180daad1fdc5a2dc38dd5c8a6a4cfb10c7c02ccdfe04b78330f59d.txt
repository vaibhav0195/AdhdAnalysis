63ac1fba58180daad1fdc5a2dc38dd5c8a6a4cfb10c7c02ccdfe04b78330f59d;;;Few days without meds;;;So my doctor was out of town when I requested a refill of my Adderall. It took a few days to get the refill authorized, which was finally done when she returned from vacation.   Those few days at work without medication really put into perspective just how much it works for me.   I went into work and was incredibly lethargic, and was dramatically overwhelmed by my usual workload- a workload that I have adapted to while being medicated. Every time something didn't go as planned, it felt as though it was the end of the world and that I'd never overcome the setback. I would look at my task list and cringe at the amount of work I needed to do, and I didn't even know where to start. I couldn't believe I was doing that with ease while medicated. The difference was literally like night &amp; day.   It really puts into perspective just how real of a condition ADHD is for us, and makes me incredibly thankful that there is a tool we could use to normalize ourselves and our productivity.     Hope everyone is having a wonderful day.
