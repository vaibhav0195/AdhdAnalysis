It asks about evaluation procedures, diagnostic techniques, dates of diagnosis and treatment, impact of diagnosis, GAF score, and recommendations.   My doctor completed the form, and I submitted it to the college, but they've come back and said that there's not enough information. I asked what additional information they need, and they couldn't specify. It seemed like a "we'll know it when we see it" type of situation.  Anyone else encounter something like this? How can I best advocate for myself in this situation?
