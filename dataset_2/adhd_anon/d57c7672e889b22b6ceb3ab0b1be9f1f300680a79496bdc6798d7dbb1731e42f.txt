d57c7672e889b22b6ceb3ab0b1be9f1f300680a79496bdc6798d7dbb1731e42f;;;Been 10 years off meds, thinking of a career change and want to see what's changed;;;So I was diagnosed at 6, which was in 1990.  Had an excellent doctor actually gave a shit and not just about the money or that my parents were bad parents.  I was diagnosed with ADD, not ADHD or whatever else there is.  Anyway, 10 years ago, I found out I can function in society without my meds.  Now, I am ready to start a new career, and I want to go back on them to see if I can do college.  The reason being that I went off them was all the warnings and stuff about heart problems, etc.  I noticed that they didn't really help me that much with work anyway.  So I can function without them until it comes to school or church, or reading in general.  The last thing I think I was on was Concerta (hopefully spelled it right), and it worked great.  Has there been any leaps in the ADD field since then?  I work nights, so I probably won't reply for 8 or 9 hours.  TL;DR What has changed in the last 10 years or so with meds?
