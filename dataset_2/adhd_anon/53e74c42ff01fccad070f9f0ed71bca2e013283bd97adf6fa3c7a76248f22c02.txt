How do you all read without having to go over the sentence 2 to 6 times.;;;My eyes tend to flicker off the page if I read for awhile.  Can't comprehend a sentence in the form of a question on a test unless I read it 2 or 6 times.   Can't watch educational videos or listen to lectures because I have to listen to music while I study or its unbearable yet when I read I can't retain it.  Even typing I will tend to forget what i was typing so I have to reread it to figure out what i was going to say next.  How do you all get by.  I was thinking of going back on medication but I gives me paranoia and anxiety to the extent that I am too terrified to speak and feel like my life is going down the drain because I think that I am not smart enough to continue my major in IT.  tl;dr  Can't focus on anything  Need music to drive me to study but it conflicts with how i learn which is through audio and visual.
