Getting stressed out about not being able to focus or fit in is also a killer on concentration.   Just look at yourself with compassion and relax. We all have our limitations in life. It is how we approach and deal with them that count.  Attacking yourself will only bring out the worse in you. When you feel terrible and can't focus, don't give up. Look at yourself and your troubles with kindness. Stop cluttering your mind any further and use your strengths.  Cheers,
