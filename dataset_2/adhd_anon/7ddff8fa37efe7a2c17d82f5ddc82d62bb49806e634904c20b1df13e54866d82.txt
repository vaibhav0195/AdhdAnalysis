7ddff8fa37efe7a2c17d82f5ddc82d62bb49806e634904c20b1df13e54866d82;;;Anxiety or ADHD??;;;I was recently diagnosed by my psychiatrist as most likely/probably having ADD/ADHD. He asked me a number of questions and aside from not being hyperactive, I do all of the things he asked. My therapist on the other hand, still is trying to tell me that this is "all anxiety." I don't know how to convince him it is not. Anyone else have this problem? I have searched and read a number of posts in /r/adhd and haven't found exactly this scenario. Thanks for any support. I am frustrated and distracted.
