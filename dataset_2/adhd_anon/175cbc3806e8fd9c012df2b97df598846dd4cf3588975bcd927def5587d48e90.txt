175cbc3806e8fd9c012df2b97df598846dd4cf3588975bcd927def5587d48e90;;;Difficulty getting a higher dose;;;So, I just got diagnosed in late October and have tried both XR and IR. Because I take Omeprazole (PPI) daily the IR works better. Problem is, the doctor at the practice I currently go to mentioned he wouldn't up my current dose (15mg IR x2 daily) because that would put me above 30mg a day. He pretty much made a point of saying that's the way it is, and it's not changing.  Anyone else have experience with this? Should I just switch doctors? I honestly think I need to get 15mg x3 daily due to the omeprazole or maybe even 20mg x3 daily.  Edit: To clarify --&gt; Omeprazole = heartburn medication. My ADHD med is adderall x2 daily 15mg
