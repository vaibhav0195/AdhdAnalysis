0e3770dacb5961fec04aad7147c5c411bba89216986079a966ae669bb0c385bc;;;Afraid to get diagnosed..;;;I was told by an MD that I might had ADHD when I was a child but my parents didn't believe in it so I kind of just got around it.. I am now in my mid 20's and I am having some problems that I've found to be symptoms of ADHD and they are starting to interfere with my work/social life. I have been averse to getting the "stigma" of being diagnosed ever since I was a child and I still feel like I hold a bit of that. I don't know what I should do. I think a big part is just worrying what others would think and who would be able to find out... I've done pretty well despite my problems but it has taken a toll and I am worried if someone found out I needed medication then they would assume everything I've done was the result of having that extra help or something... also with future jobs / licensing - who can find out if I have been diagnosed and been receiving medication? Thanks... I guess not knowing what being diagnosed and taking medications actually means is what is stressing me out.. I know the drugs to treat this are really scrutinized and I am worried that it may have a negative impact in the future? (since there are a lot of people who do not understand the disease and if they hear about the medication just assume you were trying to abuse it?) Or am I just over-thinking..
