The site's title? &gt;&gt;&gt; Who Needs Planners? (lol)  I love /r/adhd, as its been so helpful for me, but would also like to localize information in a place that's more accessible to everyone. (Reddit can be overwhelming for some.)  ***What are your favorite apps/tricks/pieces of advice?***   I'd appreciate help in building this. Also, I'd like to collect stories from those diagnosed with the disorder, for those willing to share. Feel free to email me if you'd like to submit: bjj50@msn.com.
