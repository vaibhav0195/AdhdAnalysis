68f4b6910e6ab8de213577b0de3fcafb7b598d8ec514ed256c05ad13e050317c;;;I'm having trouble at work and I'm not sure if I should tell my supervisors about my ADHD.;;;**Back story**: I have ADHD-PI, I was diagnosed in high school and I've been on and off meds through college (not to make this an novel, but my grades were terrible in college until I got back on my meds and then things improved dramatically), I'm continuing my medication at work. I tried reducing my dosage or going off meds on a few occasions but the results were bad. I have a highly technical job that I love, but the work has very high requirements for precision, neatness, clarity, thoroughness etc. There's also a lot of importance behind what I do; there are some projects where my work will be part of evidence that may be present for court cases.   **Problem**: I find that I've been talked to repeated for small errors in my work; improper labeling, incomplete notes, steps forgotten and I'm worried what my supervisors think of me. This morning I was called in to fix and error in my work, I fixed it and then immediately it was pointed out to me that I'd created another error in my rush to fix things.   Long and short of it is that I feel like crap. I'm doing poor work, I'm letting down my supervisors and the old "One ‘aw, shit’ wipes out a thousand ‘attaboys’” is very applicable here. I do some good work, I think, but all that gets wiped out every time I forget to initial something or to submit things properly. I want to do good and this company has an exceptional atmosphere. I'd like to stay here long term.    **Decision**: The second problem that stems from the above I don't know if I should tell my supervisors about my medical condition so they understand why things like this keep happening.   They're older, and I know at least one doesn't believe that ADHD is a thing and that the medication for it is terrible poison that no one should take (an actual paraphrased quote). I worry that they think I'm lazy or don't care or something when in reality the number of small details, even on meds, overwhelms me somewhat and I find there's so many things that need attention that a few slip by without me catching them. I'm worried what they'll do/how they'll react if I tell them. Either they could dismiss me as lazy and making excuses, or they may think that I'm not suited to the job because my condition.   I upped my dosage and switched to Vyvanse in the last couple days so I'm waiting to see what the results are but it feels good so far. I'm not sure if I should just wait and try to soldier on.   I'm not overly concerned that I'll lose my job over this, but that is possibility that worries me. I do feel pretty bad about myself; I feel like I'm doing a poor job and that I'm not thought of well. It's upsetting to me. :(  **TL;DR**: I'm making a lot of small mistakes at work, I'm not sure if I should tell my supervisors that I have ADHD or not, or just try to figure out a way to do better which I'm not sure is possible. In the mean time I feel really down on myself about this and the old pre-med "I'm defective/worthless" feeling is once again rearing its ugly head.   Questions for /r/adhd:  * Are there any techniques I can use to try and overcome my current problems? I know this is talked about a lot here, and I've read a lot of tips. I have no real expectation that there's a magic bullet for this and I don't think this is a viable option.   * More importantly should I approach my supervisors and explain my situation? If so, how would I go about doing this? What are the ramifications? It's very scary to think of doing this and the thought is making me tear up a little despite myself, and I really don't want to break down and cry in my supervisors office over this.   Help? :(   *Edit: Any experiences that others have had in this situation would be appreciated. How did it go for you? What were the results?
