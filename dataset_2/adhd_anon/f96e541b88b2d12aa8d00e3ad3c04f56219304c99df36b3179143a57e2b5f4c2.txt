The whole "12-hours of euphoria and motivation" effect that I had when I started out with the medication has basically completely subsided at this point, and I've been having a very difficult time coping with it.   Recently, I've been having a lot of trouble both concentrating on and just starting my school work, in addition to avoiding exercise. I still feel some of the intended effects such as concentration, but only for a period of 3 or 4 hours after the pill fully kicks in (which usually take about an hour and a half for me). After that, the effects basically aren't there. It just feels genuinely as if my dose of Vyvanse has simply lost its effectiveness, even though I know that the highest prescribed dose is 70mg.   I've read a fair amount of experiences online in which people notice that taking multi-vitamin supplements have increased the effectiveness of their Vyvanse. I couldn't find any specifics as to which are more effective, but the general consensus seems to be to just take a multi-vitamin.   My question is, to those who take or have taken Vyvanse with a multi-vitamin supplement, does the supplement actually increase the effectiveness of the medicine and/or help in treating your ADD/ADHD? If so, are there any specific supplements that you'd recommend for someone experiencing a decrease in the effectiveness of their 60mg Vyvanse prescription?  Thanks, /r/ADHD!
