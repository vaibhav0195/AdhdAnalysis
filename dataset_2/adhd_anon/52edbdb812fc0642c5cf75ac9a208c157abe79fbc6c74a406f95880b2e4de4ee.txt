52edbdb812fc0642c5cf75ac9a208c157abe79fbc6c74a406f95880b2e4de4ee;;;Do you ever feel resentment about your adhd?;;;All growing up I was told by my mom that adhd is just an excuse for laziness and I always felt like I had it, but felt guilty about it and didn't get tested until 22 because she told me it wasn't real. I finally had enough and was tested during my last year of college and was diagnosed with inattentive adhd.  I know my mom only wants what is best for me, but I still feel a slight resentment about her not supporting me when I told her I wanted to get tested in high school. I feel like I got by through high school and college on my intelligence, but feel I could have done so much better had I gotten tested earlier. I dunno, maybe I'm in the wrong for feeling a little resentment, but I can't help it. :/   Anyone else feel a kind of resentment about not being able to be tested earlier??
