cc68bbe844927b9011726d4c255f863f5888901fecde00cbbff6ea8d0c6a3930;;;Vyvanse and Adderall only make me calm, but no focus;;;I got back on Vyvanse and Adderall and it worked again for a while, but now it only makes me calm, but I can't focus. Now i can sit at my desk with no wiggling or urge to get up every 10 mins, but I can't stay focused on a task. I just keep bouncing from one to another. Any one else have this issue? Any suggestions?
