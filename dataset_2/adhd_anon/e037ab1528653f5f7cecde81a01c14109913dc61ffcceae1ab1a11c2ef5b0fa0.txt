e037ab1528653f5f7cecde81a01c14109913dc61ffcceae1ab1a11c2ef5b0fa0;;;Do people with ADHD or ADHD symptomatology tend to hang out with others of a similar disposition?;;;I am wondering if you guys found from your own experience that those with attention deficit symptoms or with an actual ADHD diagnosis tend to group together? Also does anyone know if there is a study that investigated this and if so can anyone link me to the paper?
