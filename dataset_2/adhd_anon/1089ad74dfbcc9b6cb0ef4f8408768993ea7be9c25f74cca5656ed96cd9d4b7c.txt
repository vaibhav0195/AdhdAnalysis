1089ad74dfbcc9b6cb0ef4f8408768993ea7be9c25f74cca5656ed96cd9d4b7c;;;anyone else feel, when they were younger or now, that they wanted to do something "Big" that would change the world forever?;;;**UPDATE: 25skedoo made it clearer to me that this is also part of always focusing on the "bigger picture" than on the details, just to relate it more to you folks who may not necessarily want to "change the world"**  Well now that I know I certainly do share a LOT of qualities with you people - since we all are ADHD here - I wonder if any one else ever had this deep desire within them, young, teenage, or even now?  I've always had the craziest aspirations and desires. Especially throughout high school, I imagined myself either discovering new laws in natural physics or creating the perfect "government" system. Even now, my life still seems to be drawn to some "big" goal in my future ...which now involves creating Brain Computer Interfaces. I wonder if this is something anyone else ever felt...that they wanted the world to be drastically different in some way and that they wanted to do something in their life that would make a difference.  I feel like you fellow ADHDers would understand, since you, like me, are probably always distracted most by the thoughts in your own mind. Day dreamers, etc, but this isn't a very "typical" thing for people to want. Most people I know (and most people I know do not have ADHD) have no such aspirations or goals that involve not only success for themselves, but literally, bringing about a huge change.  I really want to know if anyone else here has ever felt this or feels like this describes them!
