642f38ae6eea9bcbc986a80cc9aa5552682bd3f048776b81d5bc8b5e606ba6b8;;;Can anybody help me find a Memphis psychiatrist or GP?;;;So, I know this is a long shot, but at the age of 21 I'm looking to finally get a diagnosis and, if possible, medicated. I have what I believe to be very apparent symptoms (family is firmly against the idea of mental illness, if you're curious as to why I wasn't diagnosed as a child) and I'm at the limit of how much I can cope simply with lifestyle and habit changes. I can no longer bluff my way through classes and it's as though any control I try to assert on my life slips away.  Anyway, I'm not drug seeking, inasmuch as I don't intend on exaggerating or lying about my experience to get a diagnosis, but I know some doctor in memphis absolutely refuse to prescribe meds to adults on principle. I'm without insurance, so I can't afford to jump around from doctor to doctor til I find a good one, so I'm reaching out to the community on reddit: Anybody from the Memphis TN area know a psych or GP who is friendly and responsive to the (adult) ADHD community?  Also, as my first time going to a doctor like this, would speaking candidly about meds and the research I've done, or would that be considered drug seeking behavior?   TL;DR I'm looking for a good doc, hoping someone from the Memphis TN area can steer me in the right direction. Thanks guys, this community's been a great help for me :)
