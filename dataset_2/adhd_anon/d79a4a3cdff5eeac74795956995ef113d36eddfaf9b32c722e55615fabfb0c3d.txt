So a few weeks back I was diagnosed with ADD and had to sort out a few affairs up at university before I was willing to come home and start my course of medication. I've been prescribed Atomoxetine and Ritalin and I'm fairly sure the issues I'm experiencing are a result of the Ritalin but.. well.. here goes..  About an hour or so after taking the Ritalin I feel incredible. Like a completely different, far more productive human being than I've ever been before. But after a few hours I feel awful. Like a true sense of rage over the smallest slightest issues. Furthermore (while I manage not to) I get the urge to break down into tears over the slightest issues as well as delving into really quite dark thought patterns. Is this common? Is it something that will fade with time?  Thanks guys  TL;DR Started taking ritalin for ADD. The comedowns are so brutal I'm not sure whether it's normal or what to do.
