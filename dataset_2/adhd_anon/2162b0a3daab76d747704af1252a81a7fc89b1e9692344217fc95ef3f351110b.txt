(I'm 31 now)  I'm a professional studio music producer by trade, and my work demands hours upon hours of very focused and meticulous work.    Six months ago I tried some Vyvanse given to me by a friend as an effort to stay awake after a party.  I asked him if I could have a few more for later because I had a feeling it would help me work.  He is diagnosed with ADHD and simply gave me the rest of the bottle since he has a ton of it.  What I experienced thereafter was complete and utter clarity during my work, no more procrastination, and a joyous renewed energy and outlook on life in general.  My focus was streamlined, I was able to wake up in the morning and do my work, and everything seemed to click into place.  It's been great, but I've noticed I'm beginning to "throw in the towel" when I don't have the medicine, and not even try.  This is a sign of dependence, and I want to prevent this.  Any tips on how to avoid dependence is welcome.  At this point, I would like to continue my medication under the guidance of a professional.  Number One:  I can't keep asking my friend for his medicine, and Number Two, I have a ton of questions about dosage, procedure, and how to best utilize the medicine without causing further problems (like depression).  I think I could do well with a much lower dosage (around 10mg).  My health insurance is in place this year, for the first time in 15 years, and my first course of action is to see a psych and begin a prescription under his/her care and oversight.  So we've finally arrived at my original question:  What is the average cost of a psych visit pre-deductible?  After that, what's the cost of a Vyvanse prescription?  Thanks...

My research seems to prove my suspicions, and it's a wonder I've gotten along for so long without an actual diagnosis.    At any rate, I'm curious about the medicine.  ADHD can't be cured, only maintained.  So I'm wondering if there's ever an end-point to the medicine.  Will there come a time when I'll stop taking medicine, or am I shackled to them for the rest of my life?  I have two other adult ADHD friends, and it seems they only take the medication when they need it.  Say, 2-5 times a week or so.  However, the medicine clearly states it is to be taken every day.  I guess I'm asking, "Do you take your medicine as prescribed, or as you feel fit?"  I haven't had a chance to ask my psych about this yet, and my next appt. isn't for 3 weeks, so I figured I'd ask y'all.  :)
