b87985c1ccec0634265487f2ff51e945a74cb1599edfaf553777ef1d24ba7eff;;;Thoughts and self reflection after my first day of meds;;;I was diagnosed with ADHD this last week after a series of neurological tests, and I just took my first adderrall today. Wow, I instantly now know what parts of me were "ADHD" (I was totally blind to the extent I was displaying symptoms)...I can't believe I just dealt with it my whole life...I'm a woman (29) and did very well in school and never caused trouble in class (though I did spend ALL my time doodling...I just wrote it off as being "artistic"). Plus I was diagnosed with ADHD combined, not even ADHD PI, so I'm very surprised that it wasn't caught earlier. I'm not blaming anyone, but I basically spent my childhood running around in circles and slowly developing a horrible sense of self-esteem.   I'm just glad that the curtain is starting to lift :-)   but I can't help but think how my life would have been different had it been caught earlier, I don't know if I would wish the ADHD away as I believe it has made me a very creative person, but a self awareness of it would have been tremendously helpful...even though as a child/adolescent I probably would have really resented being "labelled" haha
