f0dad2f182f8728ca117b96f1cce63d29b8e0a0454b87be0be16ba1ebb485cfa;;;Hello! Would anybody like to make a friend? :-);;;This might come off as an odd request, but... Would anyone like to make Internet friends with someone who has ADHD? I have no friends with it, and I feel I need to talk to somebody in the same situation as me.  I was self-referred to a neuropsychologist and was told I most likely have ADHD-PI. I'm in the process of trying to find a psychiatrist who understands the disorder, but I'm not having much luck yet.  Since this is a small subreddit, and I don't have any qualms about sharing a few IM addresses, I'll just list them:  **Skype:** thorthenorse  **AIM:** thorthenorse  **MSN/YIM:** thor@ninjafrogs.com  I'm 29 a year old guy from Norway. My interests include music making, drawing, computer science and electronic circuits, in no particular order. Maybe we can discuss and help each other with projects?  If you're going to contact me on Skype, chat to me first. I can't answer calls from people I haven't chatted with first. :-)  *If anybody contacts me, I might put everyone in touch with each other in some way. I run a few websites off my dedicated server, and could set some stuff up there, maybe?*
