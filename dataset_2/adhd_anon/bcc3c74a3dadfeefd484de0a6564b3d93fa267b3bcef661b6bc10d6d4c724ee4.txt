bcc3c74a3dadfeefd484de0a6564b3d93fa267b3bcef661b6bc10d6d4c724ee4;;;I have ADHD pretty but I really don't like amphetamines;;;As a child an as an adult, I've been diagnosed multiple times with ADHD. When I was a child (about 10 - I can't remember much), I was prescribed Ritalin. I could not sleep for the life of me. I would go to bed late and have a hard time waking up. My mom took me off of it and told the doctor to not bother prescribing me anything else.    When I was an adult (albiet, young; 18-19), I went to get an assessment done  due to my teenage angst suicidal idealizations. Again, I was diagnosed with ADHD but they could not perscribe me anything because I tested positive for marijuana and they said that I might have a drug problem (which I just fucking smoked weed), and they didn't want to give me Adderall or any amphetamine because I might get addicted.   Fast forward to a few years later, I had to do a big project (webdev) and my other coding friends take Adderall and Vivance(etc) to keep them wired. They're okay I guess, but they just keep me on edge. I do notice myself being more rational, better concentrated, and even overall a better conversationalist, etc. It does make me a better person. However, it sometimes makes me too focused and it also hinders my libido. I also couldn't sleep that night. I was under the influence of it for about 24 hours.   Any advice on alternative medications or what to do to manage my ADHD?   So I could totally see a chance in me when I take amphetamines, I just don't like all the extra side effects. Also, I don't have access to any therapist/psychiatrist because I don't have any money and the state funded one has my so called "drug problem" documented.   EDIT: I meant to say "pretty bad" instead of "pretty", also, sorry if I slaughtered the spelling of the medications.
