I got my diagnosis in 2004 and tried pretty much everything on earth to get some control over my thoughts.  I ended flying to Southeast Asia to learn to meditate directly from Buddhists monks.    I learned a lot from that experience. In nutshell, the kind of meditation I learned (Mahasi) consists of paying attention of everything moment to moment. You train your brain to notice every thoughts that arise in your mind and how to avoid making a story out of them.   If I was to write everything I have to say about the subject, this post would be too long to read for anyone with ADHD. So I propose that you ask me questions instead.   During retreats I was able to quiet my mind to the extend that I would feel "ADHD free" and also experience deep form of happiness. Sadly, it's not an easy practice and I'm struggling now to bring those benefits to a "normal" life. Still, I consider now that meditation can help me greatly along with my medications.
