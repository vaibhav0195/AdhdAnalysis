They stopped refilling my prescriptions. We'd have to schedule appts more than 6 months in advance and when we did get an appointment, the wait time was over 3 hours so finding a convenient time was nearly impossible. He was the only doctor to work with adhd patients in my little town. I have since moved (it'll be 2 years at the end of the month) and about a year ago, I tried making an appointment. I am a junior in college and classes and finals are getting more and more difficult and it's really hard to do without my meds. 2 years without my meds. I tried transferring to another doctor where I'm currently at (SATX) but my old doc won't release my records to and all of the doctors I called don't treat ADHD patients. What do I do? If you live in SATX, are there any docs you'd recommend? I need my meds. I need a doctor. help!  Thank you in advance
