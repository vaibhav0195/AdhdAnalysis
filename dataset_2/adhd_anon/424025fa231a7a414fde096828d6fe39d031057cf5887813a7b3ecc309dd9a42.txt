I have intentions to do things and honestly want to, but when it comes time to do it I never do. I downed a 5 hour energy and a redbull a few days ago, and my friends were like, 'how aren't you bouncing off the walls?' I thought it was always like it was, being focused, i could actually read things without doing something else, able to listen to people talk etc... I found out in people with adhd stimulants do the opposite and make you focus, so i told my mom and am probably going to get a test soon. I think it took so long for me to find out because i used to not have to read or pay attention to get good grades, so it was never a problem, until i actually needed to. Anyways wish me luck.
