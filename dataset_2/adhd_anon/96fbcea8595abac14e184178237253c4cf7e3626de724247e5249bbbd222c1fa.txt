(Dexedrine);;;I've been diagnosed with ADHD several times in my life, but after developing an adderall addiction in high school and hitting rock bottom, I went into denial about the existence of ADHD.  I recently came to terms with the fact that ADHD is very real, and it's keeping me from being productive with my life. My doctor prescribed 10mg of Dexedrine IR and I've been taking it for 5 days now.  It's having undeniable positive effects on my life.  My apartment is clean for the first time in months and I'm able to control my eating and all the other unhealthy habits I've developed, but there's a problem.  I feel like a different person, and not in the jokey, metaphorical sense.  I feel like a ghost came along and took over my body, like "This is mine now, you go away."  I'm having more anxiety as well, but I feel like I'm in control of it.  It feels a lot like when I tried to go on Zoloft, and I quit after 2 days.  Has anyone else experienced anything like this, and did it go away with time?  Should I switch meds or stick it out?  I don't know which way is up right now, and I feel a little loopy.  Some important details:  I was a regular pot smoker, and I stopped after starting Dexedrine.   I also had depression, which I thought the Dexedrine might help with.  Right now I'm deciding whether I'll take today's dose or not.  I feel very dumb without it.  TLDR: The Dexedrine is having an antidepressant-like effect, and it's freaking me out.  Has anyone else experienced this?
