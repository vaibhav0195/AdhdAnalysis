6126e97bafc1fcc28d667a63cfc7ddb705589d3d74d01a758e9bde6888cf651a;;;Lost a friend today;;;You know, when you are down with An illness or disablity of some sort you would Sort of hope that your friends would be supportive and encouraging. Not only did a so called friend take advantage of My hospitality, he also saw fit to satiate his drunken anger by insulting my ADHD as if i was a dog. "You better f**in watch yourself because you are on speed, I know people Who take drugs and youre just one of those".  I really dont know what else to say. I had been putting up with his offhand remarks and disrespect for years. I stumbled home and broke down in tears. Why did i even bother coming back To say goodbye to these people before i left? No one bothered defending me. I was left pleading despite my hurts for him to not drink and drive home. I had hit my limit. I forgave him, but this was the end.  Im sorry for such a depressing post. But this is the reality i face. Who ever said having adhd and being stigmatized was easy? I figured i deserved better. And maybe many of you out there do Too. I leave this country in a few days. I probably wont be coming back. I am sad beyond words. I did not even utter a single judgement. All I did was ask why he had to bombard me with his.  If this is the type of Card that i am dealt with, i would Rather start over and be alone. Ive had enough.  Edit; thanks for the support. I was so put off everything that I even forgot meds today. I dont know if i have energy to reply just yet. But thank you all.
