Is that still working for you?;;;A few weeks ago, some fellows here started trying moving to stand-up desks and apparently for a lot of them it was working.  Someone said that it might just be a thing from the novelty of it, and we all know that that's true, we get really stimulated by new things.  So now that time has passed, how is that working for you guys, do you think is it worth it to modify a desk to work standing? How do you deal with standing all the time?  Thanks!
