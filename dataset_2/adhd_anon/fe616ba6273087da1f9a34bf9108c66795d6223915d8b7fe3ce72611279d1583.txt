March was the best I have ever felt in my life.  Being able to put in a normal day of work like everyone else was wonderful.  My thinking was so clear and I felt competent for the first time ever.  It was also a very emotional time, sometimes in a good way as I felt like I was finally the person I always wanted to be.  There were also times where I seemed to greave a life that could have been so much less painful.  By mid April I was back to my normal self.  My psychiatrist has increased my dose each month since then but it just isn't working.  I can't for the life of me understand how it could just stop working so quickly.  I'm going to see my psychiatrist next week and I hope he has other ideas than more Adderall.  I am desperate to feel competent and productive again.  I have tried to make nonmedical changes to help both daily routine and general health.  He had suggested I may want to try Ritalin next but why would that be any better.  If it did work well initially it seems likely that it would also loose its effectiveness in short order.  If I'm not going to feel like that again I actually wish I had never experienced it.  I had always accepted I would never be successful and that the patterns of failing would continue to the end.  I actually managed a grim acceptance of that fact.  When the Adderall was working I felt hopeful about my life for the first time.  If anyone has had similar experiences I'd love to hear about them...particularly if there is a happy resolution.  I've been trying to look into what the next approach should be but I'm lost.  tl;dr   Adderall worked great for 6 weeks then stopped helping and I would really appreciate guidance.
