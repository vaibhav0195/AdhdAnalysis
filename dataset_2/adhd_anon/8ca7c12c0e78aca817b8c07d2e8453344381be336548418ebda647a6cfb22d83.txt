Smart from a young age, but extremely disorganized and spacey. Got in trouble for it in school, but was otherwise well-behaved, so teachers let it slide. School got increasingly harder to do well in, and by the time I reached college, I was constantly skipping class and missing homework. Never failed because I have some kind of guardian angel looking out for me, but I did have to medically withdraw from my first college because of rampant depression.  Now, I've *finally* found someone willing to listen to my symptoms and diagnose me. Been trying out Ritalin for the past two months, and I've noticed I need a slightly larger dose to feel any effects at all. Worse, it wears off very, very quickly for me. At the beginning, I feel amazing. Not high or anything. It's just that my mood is better, I actually have less social anxiety, I'm motivated to get out and get things done. But it wears off *so quickly*. Within an hour usually, I'm back to my normal state of mind, with little to no remaining effects.  I'm absolutely crushed whenever the feeling of togetherness and motivation leaves. I feel like I get to experience a normal brain for an hour or less, and then I'm back to me and my crappy, constantly-bored and mildly grumpy self who never gets anything done. I even doubt that I really have ADHD, and maybe I really am just chasing a high from the Ritalin, but I don't feel like I am. I just want to have a normal brain that works and lets me be successful, and the Ritalin almost hurts more than it helps, because I chase that feeling of normalness so badly and feel its absence so much more when it's gone.  Does anyone else feel this way? Sorry, just going through a rough time right now, recently diagnosed and the only treatment I'm receiving is my Ritalin medication.
