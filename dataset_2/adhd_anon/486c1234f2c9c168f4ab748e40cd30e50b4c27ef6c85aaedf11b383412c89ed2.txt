486c1234f2c9c168f4ab748e40cd30e50b4c27ef6c85aaedf11b383412c89ed2;;;College interest in me?;;;Okay I am a HS junior, I have 4 MS credits 2 b's 2 a's, 18 HS credits all a's, and i have taken 3 OSU classes this year, 2 bios ( one i ended with a C-, one with a b-) and 1 english (pretty sure I ended with a D). I have 0 extracurriculars, but more than 300 service hours at the same place. I also had a semester long internship at OSU (the college I want to go). Does this seem like a terrible track record? Will colleges not want me? I had a car accident this year, and my meds were changed, and I had some small personal problems that they won't know about. Also I might get c's in 2 high school classes this semester.   TL;DR 20 A's, 2 B's, &lt;-high school classes 1 B-, 1 C-, 1 D+ &lt;-college classes. No extracurriculars, 300+ service hours. Could colleges want me still?
