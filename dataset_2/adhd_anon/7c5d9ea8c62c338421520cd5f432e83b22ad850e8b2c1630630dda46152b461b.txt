When I was little (probably from the ages 3-5) I would have huge meltdowns where I would just break down. I would cry, kick and scream when the littlest thing went wrong. I don't really remember them but from the stories they sound awful and would last a really long time and there was no clear reason as to why they would happen. It is very strange because I was very quiet and a "pleasure to have in class" in school. I'm just recently diagnosed ADHD (about a year ago) and now I'm wondering if those meltdowns were because of it. Maybe not being able to deal with frustration? Did Anyone else experience something similar in their childhood?
