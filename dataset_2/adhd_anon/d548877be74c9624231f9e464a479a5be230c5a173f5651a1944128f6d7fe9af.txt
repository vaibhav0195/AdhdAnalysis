We've been here for just a little over a week, and after getting the very basics unpacked the first couple days, we've just kind of...stagnated.  But tonight we finally went grocery shopping and I came home and just powered through it!  I was able to stay focused the whole time and I got everything where I wanted it and didn't slack off or put anything off til tomorrow!  Sorry, this may seem like a bit of a humblebrag, but I'm just genuinely really excited and wanted to share this with people who will understand why.  I hope everyone's having a good week!
