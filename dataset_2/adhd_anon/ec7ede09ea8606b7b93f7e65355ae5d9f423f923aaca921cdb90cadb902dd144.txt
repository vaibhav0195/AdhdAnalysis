My appointment will be in a few days when I'm home from school and I'm just wondering what to expect? My mom or dad will most likely accompany me because I've heard that parents are often questioned as well. I also live in Ontario, Canada if that makes a difference, thanks to any who reply!  TL;DR Live in canada, going to talk to doctor as I strongly feel I may have ADHD  Edit: Also I take 10mg daily of cipralex due to depression and anxiety, I've read that SSRIs can diminish the effects of some ADHD medication, should I mention this to my doctor as well?  Edit 2: Thanks for all the replies guys! Also I know I may not have given much information on why I think I have adhd but I have been doing quite a bit of research and talking to friends who have been diagnosed.
