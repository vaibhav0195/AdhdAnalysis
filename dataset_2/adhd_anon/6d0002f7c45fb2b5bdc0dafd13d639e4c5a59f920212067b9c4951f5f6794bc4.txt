I have severe ADHD, which for me mainly manifests in problems with organization (both mental and external) and focus. I also officially passed the two-year mark at an administrative office job which requires *a lot* of organization, planning, and focus.   While I've had some tough times, I'm now doing very well at my job (and even just got a promotion). I wanted to share the *actionable* tips and tricks I've picked up along the way that have made office work not just bearable but *sustainable*. If you have tips of your own, please add!   ----  **1. Establish your morning routine.**  *How you start your day has a HUGE impact on the rest of it. Having a set morning routine at work can set you up for a positive, productive day. Some ideas of what is in my morning routine:*  * **Daily To-Dos**: Before I do anything else, I write out my daily to-do list. I refer to the to-do list from my last day at work and move over any incomplete items.   * **Breakfast**: If you have appetite suppression problems like me, building breakfast into your routine can be wonderful. Now, I eat breakfast every day out of habit -- I don't have to worry about whether or not I'm feeling hungry. Plus, eating breakfast serves as a reminder to take my meds (which I never take before food).   * **Check mail**: Doing this first thing every day is an actionable step that makes me feel ready for the day.   * **Something fun**: This is so important! For me, my "something fun" is making a copy of the daily crossword in the newspaper that I work on during breaks. It could be talking to a favorite coworker, reading the paper, drinking your coffee outside -- but find something positive that is a part of every morning for you.    **2. Figure out how to plan your day.**  *Many people with ADHD have problems with both short-term* and *long-term planning. Taking the time to establish how you will plan and prioritize each day's activities will eliminate a lot of the stress that accompanies feeling out of control and lost. Everyone works differently, but here are some ideas:*   * **Traditional to-do list**: This is my primary and preferred method -- just a plain old list with checkboxes of the things I want to get done that day. Important note: *only* write down the items you can reasonably get done that day. You might not finish your to-do list every day (I often don't) and that's okay -- but don't write down items that you know aren't going to happen that day. Make a fresh one every day so you don't get overwhelmed. You'll start to learn what you can and can't accomplish in a day.   * **Online to-do lists/apps**: Some people do much better with apps or online versions of to-do lists. This could be anything from a text file to a full-blown to-do app. I use Habitica, and I like "importing" my written to-do list into the web application; being able to get the rewards satisfies my need for approval, while having the physical list in front of me keeps me on task.    **3. Figure out how to plan long-term.**  *Many office jobs require you to be able to plan ahead and do tasks on a semi-regular basis -- for example, mail this once a month, send this out once a year, etc. This can be very hard for the ADHD mind to handle, so it's important to face this problem head-on and identify problem spots. Some ways I do this:*   * **Use your company's resources**: It sounds so obvious, but it was a LONG time before I started using my personal Outlook calendar to organize my work. I had only used the company calendar as required by office policy, but I never marked my own meetings, deadlines, etc. on my own calendar. Don't neglect resources like this! In Outlook, for example, you can set reminders, color-code everything, and more.   * **Use an old-school planner**: For some, working on paper works better. Get a planner -- it can be just for work -- and use/refer to it faithfully.   * **Work backwards and set your own deadlines**: For ongoing or recurring projects, work backwards from the due date to set your own mini-deadlines. For example, if I have a mailing that goes out every 3 months, I will set a deadline for when I have to have the copy checked, when I have to make sure we have the materials, when I have to print, when I have to mail, etc. Once you come up with these, **WRITE THEM DOWN** in your preferred organizational tool.   * **If you're given deadlines, write them down**: Again, this is probably obvious to non-ADHDers, but I would so often not write down deadlines, especially other people's (ex., Dr. X is supposed to send me ABC by this date). Now, they have their own color category and I see them as they approach when I log in to Outlook. Much easier!   * **Get a whiteboard!**: Old-school? Sure, but it works! Get a small whiteboard to write down anything unusual -- one-time projects, super important deadlines, etc. Hang this right in your field of vision where you won't miss it.   * **Use Outlook's Delay Delivery function**: I cannot properly express how much this has helped me out! In Outlook, when composing a message, you can delay delivery until a certain date and time by going to the "Options" tab. If you get a message that says "Do X, but don't do it until this date," forward it to yourself and have it delivered on that date. You can also email yourself reminders this way -- just make the email subject "REMINDER: DO X TODAY" and send it to yourself. This feature is a GODSEND.    **4. Identify the guilt and anxiety.**  *ADHD can cause us to feel a lot of guilt and anxiety, especially when we're in jobs we may not be naturally suited for. It is so, so important to figure out the exact source of this guilt and figure out how to handle it. Here are some examples from my job:*   * I felt a lot of guilt about **not answering emails on time** and **constantly having voicemail to check**, so I established a "no email in the box" rule for the end of the day.   * I frequently **missed deadlines** for recurring but irregular (ex, not on the same day) projects, so I set up a double reminder system to keep that from happening.   * I felt guilty about **procrastinating too much**, so I made a plan to reduce the amount of procrastination.   * I felt guilty about **frequent therapy appointments**, so I had a discussion with my boss and worked out something that makes everyone more comfortable.    **5. Establish an End-Of-Day Standard.**  *How you end your day influences how you start the next one. This doesn't need to be complicated. For me, it's:*  * **No voicemail** and **no email** at the end of the day -- I don't always succeed but I always strive for this. If I don't have time to deal with all email, I still end the day with my inbox at 0 by using the **delay delivery** function mentioned above to forward the messages to myself to handle the next day.   * **Neatness standards** are not something I have strict rules about, but I don't let myself leave without my desk being in some semblance of order. Make sure to give yourself 5-10 minutes of "tidy-up" time at the end of the day.    **6. Let your work help you.**  *Even if you don't feel comfortable sharing your diagnosis, there are many ways your workplace can help you thrive. Here are some examples:*  * **Change your hours**: If you struggle with lateness and fatigue, like I do, see if you can move your hours back. Doing this made an immeasurable difference in my quality of work life.   * **Order new supplies**: Many offices will let you order office supplies without question, so think of what would help you. For example, my work got me a whiteboard, planner, phone headset, and some desk organizers -- this has nothing to do with my ADHD, as far as they know, but it does help!  * **Talk about accomodations**: There are many accomodations you can make that might make your work life easier. For example, I've said to my boss, "I have a lot of emails to get through today -- I'm putting on white noise headphones, so just let me know if you need me." Don't be afraid to do something differently just because you don't want to look different -- your workplace wants you to succeed and will generally accomodate your needs.   * **Be honest with your supervisor** if you can: If you're falling behind or having trouble, most supervisors would rather know that and help you fix the problem. Way too often, I pretended nothing was wrong until things were *really* bad. It's okay (and often encouraged!) to keep your boss updated on how you're doing!   **7. Get connected.**  *This may not be a problem for others, but I used to let a lot of the guilt and shame I felt over being a "bad worker" isolate me from much of the rest of my office. Feeling socially connected can improve your mood and work ethic. Here's a few things I've done:*  * If there is an **employee appreciation program** of some sort, participate as much as you can! If there's not, suggest starting one. In my office, we fill out cards if a coworker does something exceptional or helpful, and two individuals win a drawing at the end of the month. I've made it a specific goal to write two of these a week -- this gets me out of my own bubble and makes me really look for generosity and hard work in others.   * **Join voluntary groups** if you have the chance -- my office, for example, has a "Friends of IT" group that meets semi-monthly to discuss IT issues from the perspective of all departments. This will get you connected and provide a sense of novelty, as you'll get to do projects and have discussions you ordinarily would not.    **8. How to stay focused / miscellaneous.**  *Planning is important -- so is doing. Here are some ideas that may help:*  * **Use a Pomodoro timer** or similar -- stay on task for a certain interval, then take a break.   * **Mix in fun and boring projects** -- admins generally plan their own days, for the most part, so try to work on novel/interesting projects AS WELL as the boring, routine stuff.   * **Productively procrastinate**: Look, we're all going to procrastinate. Try to make it productive. For example, I will use work breaks to deal with personal to-dos, like paying bills, dealing with finances, answering emails, etc. Even better...  * **Make a list of dream projects**: Make and frequently reference a list of projects you would like to do if you have time. We ADHDers often have a lot of ideas about how to make things run better or more smoothly -- write these things down! When you feel like procrastinating, look at that list -- now THAT is productive procrastinating!   * **Write down your accomplishments**: Preferably somewhere where you can't lose them. This will boost your self-esteem and also be very handy when evaluation time comes around.   * **Don't beat yourself up**: We're all going to have low-focus days. It sucks, but try not to beat yourself up. What's important is that you keep trying.   * **Look for opportunities within the company**: There are often many opportunities to take on projects outside of what your actual job description is, and if you can take advantage of these, your work will be more varied and interesting. For example, I now run a conference solo every year and am the administrator for one of our software platforms, just because I asked.    **9. Stay positive!**  *I went back and added this, because I think it's incredibly important. Some of these are also in items above but bear repeating here.*  * **Make a list of your accomplishments** and refer to it once in a while. Even looking at a to-do list filled with lots of x-es will make you realize that you ARE getting work done.   * **Think about what you're good at** and try to take on projects that align with your skills. Don't forget that just because administrative tasks may not come easily to you, there *are* things that you excel at. If you can make them a part of your work, your mood will improve immensely.   * **5 Happy Things**: Try to make a list of 5 positive, work-related things every day. Try not to repeat. They can be work-adjacent if needed ("Saw a really cute dog on my lunch break!") but focus on things about your work that are good. This is so easy to do and it really makes a difference.  * **Know that you'll NEVER be done** -- and that's a **good thing**. ADHD obviously has its drawbacks. It also has its positives -- namely, that our minds run a million miles a second and we generate ideas like crazy. You are going to come up with a million ideas and possibilities, and you won't achieve them all. But don't let this be a bummer! Remind yourself of how much you *are* doing, and the fact that you have some perpetually unfinished items on your to-do list just means *you have a lot of ideas*. Take pride in that.    ----   **TL;DR**: Having ADHD at an office job is not impossible and it doesn't have to be soul-crushing. Keep thinking critically about what's working and what's not, and it's absolutely within your power to make your office job not just tolerable but even enjoyable.
