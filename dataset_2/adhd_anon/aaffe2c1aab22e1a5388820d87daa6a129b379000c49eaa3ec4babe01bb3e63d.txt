(AUS);;;Last week I went to see a psychiatrist to talk about my lifelong ADHD symptoms, and next session he'll basically be diagnosing my subtype (which based on the DIVA 2.0 he gave me to fill out at home, pretty certain I fall under primarily inattentive) and starting me on a medication plan. He gave me a sheet listing four different medications that he prefers to prescribe: * Dexamphetamine * Vyvanse * Ritalin * Concerta  I pretty much crossed Vyvanse off my list though because in Australia you can only get it at a reasonable price ($30 a month) if you were diagnosed at the age of 18 or prior, so it would wind up costing me $113 a month (which sucks because my brother is on Vyvanse and it's really helped him). Whereas I can get a reduced price on the others.   I'm leaning towards Concerta given it is extended-release, especially because I'm a full-time Uni student and have a lot of work to get through, but my boyfriend has been on Ritalin since he was 6 and found that to be really useful, although I've heard it can be rather "punchy".   I know that everyone's experiences differ and sometimes you need to try a few before getting onto the medication that is right for you, but regardless I would like to get a feel for what might be best suited to me prior to beginning my treatment.   **So, what are people's positive/negative experiences with Dexamphetamine, Ritalin, and/or Concerta? You can also tell me about other medications that you've found really useful, given I don't *need* to stick to the meds he prefers to prescribe**
