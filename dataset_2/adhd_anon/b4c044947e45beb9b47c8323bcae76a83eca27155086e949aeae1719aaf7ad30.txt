Even back then, most people (the evaluator included) was surprised that I came up as ADHD because I was pretty capable.  Fifteen years later, I'm going to grad school and decide to get on meds. When I went to the school counseling office, the people there clearly didn't believe me, mostly because I'm continuing my education.  I've since switched to a different counseling center and to a counselor that believes me, but even now I still can't shake the feeling that I'm cheating by taking meds. My last evaluation from 8th grade stated that I had no issue finishing problems in the allotted time, and that I often did above average or very well on my tests.  I know there's more to being ADHD than being able to finish a test. I've set up a whole bunch of coping mechanisms for myself and have comorbidity like many experience (anxiety, depression), but what if it's all in my head? What if I'm just too lazy to get my work done by myself? How do you really know?
