Professor called me into her office and asked if I had "concentration problems" and told me not to worry about my grade, because she knew that I understood everything from my performance in class.  I just got my first test back in an engineering class that I am taking and I got a C. No, this isn't the win part, because I thought I aced it. After class, my professor called me into her office and asked if I had concentration issues, because for all of the problems she could follow my work about half way through then have no idea what I was doing. The professor called me into her office because she thought that I was going to ace the test as well, based off of my performance in class and was confused with my C. She told me not to worry about my grade, and that we would work on a strategy to combat my test taking anxiety. She also mentioned that she makes the final decision on peoples grades for the semester, and that if I kept up performance in class, that I would do fine in her class.  First time having a professor approach me about my ADHD/ test taking anxiety. I was already planning on speaking with her, but her contacting me just made my day. I do get extra time on tests, but I was trying not to miss my next class so I decided to take the test in class because I was very comfortable with the material. She's letting me take the next test in a separate room and she says that I can get up and walk around the room if I need to relax a bit.
