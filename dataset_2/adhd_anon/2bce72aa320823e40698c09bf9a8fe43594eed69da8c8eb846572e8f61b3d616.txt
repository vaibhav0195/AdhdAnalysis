We are on vacation with our ADHD child.;;;Things are not as bad as one of my friends who has children with ADHD and Asperger's. We have been in Greece for a month and have a week to go and the one minus is that she's lost interest in reading. If that's the worst of it for now, I can deal. I've managed to get her jealousy in check regarding her younger sisters, AND we have been able to focus on things like learning to swim without arm bands.

Then again, we have only been seeing this man for  a little under a month (2 times per week). I don't know what to expect. From my experience working with adults that have impulse control issues, we have managed to use Cognitive Behavioral techniques in conjunction with medication, but so far, she's just been drawing elephants.
