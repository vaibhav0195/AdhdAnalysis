4eddaa2dd27ceb4f2515f6293e504c219b5d183db4d94e0fa3f9dc0bed9e0ba7;;;Bad interaction with allergy meds?;;;I've been recently diagnosed with ADHD and before that depression. Have any of you had a bad reaction between ritalin and zyrtec or something similar? I recently started ritalin and thought things were going well until one day where I felt full of despair. So I'm trying to figure out if it was due to the already present depression getting worse, side effect of ritalin, or a bad reaction to the zyrtec I started taking that day. Anybody have similar experiences?
