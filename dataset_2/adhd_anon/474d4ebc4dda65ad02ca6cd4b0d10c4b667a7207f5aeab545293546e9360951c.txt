I've spent years debating on whether or not I have ADD, or depression, or if I just have terrible memory.. and I've come to the conclusion (along with some online self tests in which they've further confirmed my self diagnosis) that I do indeed have ADD. My struggle to focus is depressing, especially now that I have a full time job that requires me to think more critically and focus, which I struggle with very much. I've mentioned my memory issue to my doctor, he recommended I go to a neurologist, which I did. He asked me a bunch of questions about my day to day routine, sleeping habits, diet habits, and if I do any drugs. I told him I didn't drink much, diet isn't 100% great but probably better than most/average, but I smoke weed. He instantly blamed all my memory issues on weed and it honestly pissed me off. I'm sick of weed being the scapegoat for my problems. I have friends who smoke boatloads of weed and have great memory recall, great focus, no signs of ADD/depression.  One of my long time best friends smokes weed and he is *literally* a rocket scientist, so I'm sorry if I have a tough time thinking weed is the issue here, although I am aware it's probably not exactly helping. I know I probably have ADD, but my question to you fellow ADD redditors is do all of you have a primary struggle with memory? What I'm trying to do is determine if this is a separate issue from ADD, or if this is a direct effect of having ADD. And if so, what do you do to help cope with it.  Again, long time lurker, so I've learned alot so far, but I'm considering going to a new neurologist in hopes that they aren't going to just blame weed for my problem and wanted some feedback so I have a better approach and hopefully can soon get some real treatment. Thanks all.  EDIT: Spelling corrections.
