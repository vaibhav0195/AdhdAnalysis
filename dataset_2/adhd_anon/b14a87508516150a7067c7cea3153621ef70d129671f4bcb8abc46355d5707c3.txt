This is, of course, a standard ADHD refrain, and we all know it isn't true, but when I keep dropping zeros and whatnot it's very discouraging.  I've prepped a lot, and my score if fine but could be a lot better if I didn't make so many damned silly errors! Does anybody have any tips for avoiding this sort of thing? I can keep myself on track and on task normally and have found systems to reign in my working memory, but this has me very frustrated.  Thanks a ton, pals ~~~
