He recommended we try Escitalopram first. 10MG a day for a month, and see if it helps. Anyone else have experience with this solution?  I am really disappointed. I really wanted to get onto an ADHD drug specifically. But I can't tell if my disappointment is just because I don't know enough, and I got my hopes up for just one of the many ways to address this.   I am also disappointed because I've been told this takes a week or two to kick in. And I really wanted to feel a difference today.  Anyway, I am going to go through with the prescribed month of this. And meet with my doctor again to see where I am at that point, and what course to take next.
