d9fe13b5d8901fdd0540fda863f583eef313e91551baa516a8004018ef3110e6;;;Advice Needed: 7 yr old step son just diagnosed with adhd;;;My step-son was just dignaosed with adhd and has been prescribed adderall in a low dose with time release. This has all happened very quickly in about 4 weeks. Since we only have him part of the time, what are some of the things we can do to set him up for success? Is there anything we should avoid? How do we know when it's his adhd vs being a 7 yr old boy? I have been doing some research but there isn't a lot out there for his age group.
