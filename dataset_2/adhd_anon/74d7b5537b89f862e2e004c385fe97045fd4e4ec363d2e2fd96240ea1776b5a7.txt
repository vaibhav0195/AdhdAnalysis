74d7b5537b89f862e2e004c385fe97045fd4e4ec363d2e2fd96240ea1776b5a7;;;So I am reading a lot of ADHD related questions and want to make a pointer for all the problems listed.;;;Honestly, almost every single issue I see here is not just a request for ADHD life hacks, a lot of them seem to sound like full blown anxiety.  Since we have ADHD we automatically assume the worst possible outcome and worry that ADHD = fucking up. People without ADHD fuck up as well. XD  Constantly worrying about the possibility doesn't make us prepared for when something unpredictable does take place.  It is good to take precautions but worrying about every tidbit of outcomes seems unhealthy to me as someone who did go through an anxiety disorder and experienced that very same thing.  People with ADHD are 60-80% more likely to develop co-morbidity. Anxiety disorders being 40%.  Stimulants have a side effect of worsening anxiety or causing it.  The only reason I have my anxiety under control is because of a changed perspective about controlling my environment and meditation.  TL;DR: a lot of the worries on here seem to be caused because of anxiety, even people without ADHD cannot control every single outcome, I would pursue finding a solution to anxiety, even if you find a solution to your current problem, you will surely find another issue that seems insignificant to worry about in no time.
