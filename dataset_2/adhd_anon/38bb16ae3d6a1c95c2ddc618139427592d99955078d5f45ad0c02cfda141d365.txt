A couple months ago I looked into finding a good doctor that specializes in diagnosing adult adhd so I contacted the local adhd society and they pointed me in the right direction. I ended up picking up a stack of required tests and questionnaires from his clinic and within a week had submitted them. Few weeks pass by and I get a call saying he would like to see me and made an appointment for what felt like a century away. That appointment is this friday. All I know is I have to sit down with him and talk for an hour and a half (worst nightmare) and then I'm not sure what happens from there, if anything. Thing is, the closer I get to the appointment the more I doubt myself. Anyone else feel that way leading up? I'm getting pretty stressed out about it and I guess I feel like if he concludes that there's nothing wrong with me, that I'm destined to forever be a failure. I almost feel like I'm making it all up in my head and was just always lazy in school or something and now I'm just making excuses and he's gonna see riiiiight through me.  I'm female, 26 and dropped out of school in grade 10 and most people I come across seem to think I'm sharp as a tack, no ones ever questioned my graduating and I let them all assume I have. I'd like to make that a reality and move on to bigger things and not secretly feel I'm beneath others.   I've re-read this like ten times and I can't decide if it makes sense or if there's any real point to it but I'm going to submit it anyway and see what happens...
