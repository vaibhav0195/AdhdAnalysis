This is my 5th or 6th major since starting school, and I mostly settled on it because the job outlook is pretty good.   &amp;nbsp;  That's not to say I'm not interested in CS. Or that I'm not interested in the other 5 or 6 majors I chose. On the contrary, I'm interested in **all** of them. I have all these interests in all these things, and could see myself doing a million different jobs from cybersecurity analyst to writing on psychology to busking in a foreign country. But all I want is to be *passionate* about one thing, enough to at least get through a college degree without getting depressed over bullshit classes that I don't need and won't help me.   &amp;nbsp;  I'm not big into faith or destiny or any of that, but I can't fight this nagging feeling that I'm not doing what I'm supposed to be doing. I can't "muscle through it" anymore, sorry Dad, but my brain won't cooperate with me when it hates what I'm telling it to do.   &amp;nbsp;  My guess is I'm being spoiled and setting my expectations way too high. Maybe we can't all "love what you do" and maybe that's ok. I just want to be happy and fulfilled and I have no idea how to go about achieving that. I don't even know where to start. I don't get how people have this figured out at 22 years old when I feel like a teenager taking an online aptitude test.   &amp;nbsp;  Anyways, thanks for listening. Just venting this out makes me feel a little calmer. Woops, assignment due in 2 hours, nevermind.
