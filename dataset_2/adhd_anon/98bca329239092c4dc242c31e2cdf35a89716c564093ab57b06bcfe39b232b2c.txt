I've had depression in the past as a young adult. Since then I've had general anxiety issues.  I feel like a lot of the depression symptoms have gone over time.. One thing I've noticed that has crept up over the last few years is I've become more anxious about tasks that need to be performed.  It's been hard for me to plan and execute things.. I feel like I have ideas and things I want to do that I see as a priority but they somehow get "lost" in all the other things.  When I have to prioritize and make decisions, I freeze up.. the anxiety manifests itself in anger..  When i'm overwhelmed with tasks at work, it gets to the point where it's like in the movies when you get that ringing in the ears and people are talking to you but you're in a fog and can't hear them anymore and your brain wants to shut down.  It also get extremely exhausted thinking about all the tasks that need to be done.  When my wife talks about stuff that "needs to be done around the house" or "how much we need to clean", the anxiety comes out as anger.   My memory is shot.. It's hard for me to remember dates and anything prior to yesterday.    I plan on talking to a professional about this, but wanted to get your takes on it in the interim.
