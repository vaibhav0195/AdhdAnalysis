3c05551c050e3d9364e4a0612e7ff9b3d165652ab81d35eafd1c34d1e51b3166;;;I Need help explaining Adhd to someone;;;I need to explain my adhd to my girlfriend. She knows that I have it, but i don't think she really understands it fully (her reaction was similar to "but you aren't jumpy or hyperactive")  Is there an easy way to explain it properly to her? I'm aware of the post on /r/explainlikeimfive, and I have that post bookmarked, but in this case I need to do it in person, and I'd prefer to explain it verbally rather than have her read a wall of text.  Is there a way I can verbally explain my adhd accurately without rambling on and on? Or any examples I can give?
