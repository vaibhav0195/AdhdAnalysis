I was diagnosed a while ago at around 12, now I'm 18 and just now starting medication just to see if it helps. So far I have been very disappointing, I have been taking Vyvanse for a little more than a week working from 30-40. The 1st day I tried 50 I sweat profusely, the second was better yet still unpleasant. Furthermore, I can't say that I feel anything significant. About 2-3 hours after the Vyvanse I feel a little more alert, maybe a little jittery but It fades quickly. Maybe I don't know what I should be feeling? Just now I took 20mg of Adderall IR and don't feel much more than an increased heart rate. Very disappointed any help or insight would be greatly appreciated.
