Family and friends have noticed a significant difference in my concentration and behavior whilst on the medication, as to when I'm not on it (I usually stop during summer months).. However, it comes with waves of depression, disassociation, nausea, dizziness and sometimes unbearable sedation. I would love to stop it, but without it I am unable to function in an academic environment - so for two years I have pushed through these adverse effects but I've reached a point where I'm not sure I can handle it any longer. I am unable to discuss this with my physicians as they would prefer to take me off it. They see ADHD as a developmental disorder and think that I would no longer need this, I've tested this during summer months but family, friends &amp; colleagues all comment on my inability to focus when I am off it. Where do I go from here? I'm feeling very lost.   Here's a little background on me that may help guide anyone who would live to advise me on what to do:  - 20 years of age, diagnosed ADHD at 16  - Prescribed Straterra, have been on it since 17/18, currently on 60mg  - Live in the UK so Straterra is pretty much the only ADHD medication that is allowed to be prescribed, especially to someone my age
