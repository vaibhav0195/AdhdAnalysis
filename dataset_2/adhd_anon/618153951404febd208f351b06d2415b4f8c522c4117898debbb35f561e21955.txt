I have been getting depressed on Sundays, like really just lethargic, dull, unmotivated, and generally just down. He said it was from the Vyvanse leaving my system after taking it every day during the school week. Being 17, he told my parents and I that it is smart to take it everyday.... even SATURDAY and SUNDAY. Id rather not take stimulants on the weekend, to allow time for relaxation, (eating and sleeping) or just creative fun. My parents say that I have to listen to the doctor and take it everyday, but im proposing that i only skip Saturday, then take it Sunday to avoid the depression?? I DONT KNOW! ANY advice, experiences, facts, or things i should explain to my parents?   daydream on.
