a1e952e6cc74fbfa365fc069f9fe220a703e88925abb586ee16093b89ab185ad;;;Irritability and meds.  ;;;I am taking adderal xr.  My psychiatrist told me before the medication that I would have some irritability the first couple of weeks. I started of with 10 mg and I was fine. On day 7 i switched up to 20 mg like he instructed. The day before i felt like the meds were ineffective for the most part. So now it is day 9 and everything is like nails on a chalkboard to me.  I am keeping it together and not lashing out but it is really tough. Anyone else experience this and did it go away for you?
a1e952e6cc74fbfa365fc069f9fe220a703e88925abb586ee16093b89ab185ad;;;Quality problem;;;I have been on Adderall for 4 months and have reached a stable dose of 30 mg xr and 30 mg of regular for the afternoons. Now that i can focus and pay attention I am experimenting with different methods of making the best use of my time to get done what i need to, keep on task, and still have room for  hobbies and enjoyment. The quality problem I refer to in the title is that I feel a great deal of frustration in learning this skill.  I am 34 and I know this is something I would have learned much earlier without ADHD. I feel quite juvenile right now.  I can empathize too a small degree with those who have suffered a trauma that wiped the slate clean and now have to relearn everything. Has anyone else experienced something similar?
