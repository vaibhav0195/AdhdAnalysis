She first sets up a clever contest in which we use obscure or bizarre words in a creative manner. Our “contest” quickly grows into amusing text battles. We jump on misspellings, ambiguities, miscommunications, typing errors, improper attributions and every other English sin under the sun.  [Laugh your way through the battle between TWO “ADHD Powered” lovers of words!]
