I walked out of my appointment with Doc A two weeks ago with a Zoloft script, which I've been on since then, and it's got my anxiety under control, but hasn't touched my attention.  Last night was my followup with Doc B, and it confirmed my earlier unofficial diagnosis from a therapist - ADHD-C. She was shocked that I was on Zoloft (which I stopped today, felt like a zombie on it), because I *don't have clinically significant anxiety or depression* and was misdiagnosed by Doc A, as I suspected.   And now I need to find a family doctor who is comfortable prescribing ADHD meds. Doc A said they won't treat my ADHD because their clinician didn't diagnose it - I don't meet their criteria. Which is unfortunate, but it's a specialist, so a family doctor will be cheaper in the long run.  Thanks everyone who suggested I get a second opinion. I'm glad to know I'm going to be getting the proper treatment soon.
