Im a 20-something college student who has recently began seeing a psychiatrist for focus problems. During the first visit, my psych asked me if I've ever heard of ADHD, and prescribed me with Concerta (please note that he never explicitly stated that I had ADHD). I changed to Vyvanse after 3 weeks of bad results with Concerta, and last week during a follow up appt I switched again to an IR alternative, Dexedrine.   The reason I ask this is because I am aware that schools offer a Disabled Students program, where reasonable accommodations are made for students, such as extra exam time, permission to record lectures, etc. Now, my school requires I have an official diagnosis of ADHD in order to use the benefits of the DS program, and I'm wondering since my doctor never mentioned that I have ADHD, if I still qualify for the help.   I plan on calling my doctor's office soon to see, but I wanted to see what you guys have to say about this. Thanks in advance!
