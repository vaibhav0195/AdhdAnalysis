Even though I got by, I was always miserable and eventually went down the road of self-medication which turned out very badly.  The handful of times I took vyvanse or adderall I remembered feeling like I could finally think straight.  I want to explore this possibility, but I want to do it legitimately this time.  I just don't know who I should see to get evaluated.  I looked at a psychologist's office that does intensive testing, but it's extremely expensive and I don't know how valid the diagnosis would be when it comes to getting treated.  Should I just go straight to a psychiatrist? Or is the testing necessary to getting a valid diagnosis?
