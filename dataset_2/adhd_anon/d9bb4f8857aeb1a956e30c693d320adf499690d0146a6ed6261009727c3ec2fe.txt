I've been bartending for the past 4 years and was DX a few weeks ago. I've been on 20mg IR 2x a day for about a week. Yesterday I took a 20mg about a half hour before my shift (430) and I felt fine for happy hour and into the beginning of the dinner rush but around 9or so I felt the come down and I was super moody and somewhat angry for the remainder of my shift. Any tips from fellow service industry folks? I'm going on at 6 tonight and I was thinking  of taking my last dose at 545 so I can get the kick around 6.   It just sucks that it wears off right around the time that we get our late night rush but I don't want to redose at like 10pm and be up all night.
