I've consistently done horrible in many classes, only achieving A's or B's in a handful. A lot of my time has been catching up because I left High School when I was 15 (with a CHPC). I started attending at 25, after being discharged from the Army, so it had been a decade since I had attended any classroom (outside of military related classes).  I was diagnosed a couple of months ago with ADHD as a 28 y/o and prescribed a form of Adderall.  [This](http://i.imgur.com/mmfAonr.png) is my third (and last allowable) attempt at Calculus I (I have to take 3 semesters of it)  Aside from the school aspect, I finally feel like I can prioritize and my life no longer suffers from forgotten tasks (which were often important).
