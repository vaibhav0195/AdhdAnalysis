(means that I have a hard time processing information, especially auditory, and difficulty with memory retrieval. I can learn things but have a difficult time recalling them unless I have something to remind me.)  So my brother, now 17, also has ADHD and has been on Focalin since he was 5 or so but my parents are strongly strongly against medication for me. They think I should try to do a semester of uni with the new accommodations they'll give me, but I think the root issue will still be present. It doesn't matter if I have a note taker for lectures and can record the lectures and have dragon naturally speaking transcribe lectures into readable notes if I can't sustain focus long enough to read them.   My parents also worry about me going through the med trial period (I know there's a fancy name but can't remember what) without them to monitor me, but I know the trial period could take up to six months and I can't take six months out of my life to move back home, that's more than a semester of school. The other catch 22 is I live in Canada and they live in the states, so there's a different set of meds available there than there is here.  And I could start meds without their blessing, I have insurance through my school, doctors are covered by the socialized healthcare, my roommate is starting her phD is psychology in the fall and would 100% keep an eye on me, both as a close friend that knows me well and as someone that knows what bad side effects look like.   Are there any of you that aren't medicating but managing? Or any trial period/side effect horror stories? Or anyone that is on medication and loves it/hates it?   Thanks in advance.
