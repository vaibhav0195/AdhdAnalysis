c51fc9d9c9ba4943bad54e006e8aaaa2ede01ee79b0da8b8a5ee6ec7ca8e2fc1;;;Prescribed 10mg Ritalin. 3rd day on it and still unsure if it's working or not.;;;16/F I was diagnosed with ADD just last Monday. My psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Ritalin (Regular release) tablets. According to the description she gave me, it takes up to 1HR for it to take effect and I need to take it 3x a day.   My mom doesn't want me taking it all the time because she's afraid of the side effects so I only take it when I need it. Today is my 3rd time on it as I only take it when I feel the need to.   Here's my experience with it so far:  1st time (Tuesday):   * Waited around 30 mins after a meal before taking it.  * After what I presume to be around 40 minutes, I felt some kind of rush - I felt really happy for like 10 seconds and a bit hyper and more energized.  * Music seemed to sound much better and clearer. Like I could keep track of the song and my work at the same time. * Did so much homework in a span of 3-4 hours with no breaks in between at all. I felt like I was focused, too. In the end, I didn't have any of the side effects.    *Thought this was all placebo because it was my first time taking it and I kept expecting the results.*  2nd time (Wednesday):   * Took it 30 mins before eating a slice of pizza for lunch. After 20 mins, I just felt like doing everything but it's probably placebo effect?   * My classmate asked me if I could do her work and I immediately accepted it. Focused on it but I was working too fast and made some careless errors. She also commented that I  was working really fast.  * An hour later, I'm running all over the classroom trying to get my project done - *ended up not finishing it because I didn't know how to do a couple of things needed.*  * Again, music sounded nice. Listening to a good song I almost always listen to made me feel euphoric and happy at one point but only for a short while.  3rd time (Thursday|Today):  * Took a pill an hour after I ate a small snack for breakfast.  * after around 30 mins, I felt a head rush. Like sort of trippy or lightheaded for 10 seconds.  * Went to a meeting with a teacher for 25 minutes. Came back and started working on a letter for a friend because why not. Wrote so fast and barely stopped to think about what to say. Messy letter, though.   * Fast forward to next class: I felt energized enough to think faster and focus on my work although I had some other unrelated thoughts in my head.   * Effects seemed to start to wear off after a total of just 2.5 hours.   **No experienced side effects at all aside from decreased (not zero) appetite.**   Apologies for the long read and the numerous details. I really just want to know if what I'm feeling is placebo effect or if this is the real thing. Also, while on ritalin, I don't finish everything on my TTD list but 4/5 of them at least.   Should I bump up my dosage? I can't ask my doc because I'm in another country and will only get to see her once or twice a year.  If my dosage is the issue, can I take **2 pieces of 10mg pills (20mg) or 1 and 0.5 pieces of 10mg pills (15mg) at once** to strengthen the effects? Or would I be totally screwed up?  Thanks, reddit!  TL;DR Diagnosed with ADD and I have been prescribed 10mg of ritalin. I'm not sure what it's suppose to feel like and I'm worried it's all placebo. I get *almost* the same exact feeling - *energetic, can focus on doing something for a longer while, moving much faster* - every time I take ritalin but still doubtful because the effects seem too subtle and inconsistent or slightly different whenever I take it. Should I increase my dosage or is this all fine?  Edit: Also, is being somewhat careless but concentrated part of the whole experience?
