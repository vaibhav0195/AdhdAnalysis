I had my monthly doctor's appointment to discuss my ADHD and renew prescriptions this week, and I mentioned to my doctor that while Vyvanse is great for getting things done, I don't find the motivation to do the work that I'm supposed to do like when I was first diagnosed and prescribed ritalin. I was implying that I wouldn't mind being prescribed it again, and my doctor informed me that all drugs but Vyvanse, Concerta, and Strattera (or Wellbutrin) are now illegal to prescribe due to their abuse potential.  I've had a non-Concerta methylphenidate prescription within the past year from my old GP before I had my psychiatrist for this stuff, so it seems weird to me and I'm wondering if he just thinks I'm drug seeking.
