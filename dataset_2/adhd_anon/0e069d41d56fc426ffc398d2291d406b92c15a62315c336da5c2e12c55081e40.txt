[rant-ish];;;Meds or not, I never breeze through A SINGLE FUCKING THING. I spent three hours at my table trying to do a POS little calculus assignment that my classmates could do in less than half an hour (a classmate did it in front of me in the bus and submitted it right in front of me, that motherfucker).  Honestly, I feel like the slowest, most retarded person on the planet.  It has been this way since high school, where the writing and assignments began to increase. Before that, I was taking school so lightly that I didn't even consider studying a thing.  I can barely keep up in class lately. It feels like my classmates are all on jet-skis, blazing away, having fun while learning; while I am trying to push a shitty old car to the finish line.  I don't know what my problem is. I get enough sleep, I do enough exercise, I eat enough food.  Seriously, I want to go cry in a corner right now.  **tl;dr i am damn fucking slow at studying and it makes me want to cry**
