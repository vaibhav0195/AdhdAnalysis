I seriously can not imagine the type of person I would be without my ADHD. It is a complete part of my personality. People who meet me think I'm weird, but I've molded myself to be weird in a good way. I laugh at my ADHD, people think I'm funny. But I also have the ability to be quiet, to entertain myself, to spend hours upon hours programming or talking philosophy, doing math, etc. ADHD has made me unusually smart, due to the amount of time I can spend on a problem I enjoy, the amount of time I spend by myself. The social problems were significant when I was young, but now as an adult I have simply worked passed them, I am now considered a wonderfully social and funny guy, but with a level head. Non ADHD people can't understand us, and that's perfectly OK, because our uniqueness is what will keep them around, help us succeed in life. Enjoy your ADHD, and if your going through a tough part of life now, just remember we can always improve.   *side note: legal adderall, just saying :)
