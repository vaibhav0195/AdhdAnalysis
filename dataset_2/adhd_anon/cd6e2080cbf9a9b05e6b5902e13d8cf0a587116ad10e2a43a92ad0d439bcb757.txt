I Just recently made my to-do list, and, well, i understand everything about making a to-do list doable and make it easy to do.  Though, i have a comic i have to make until october 2nd and i have no clue as to How i will put it into my to-do list, like, i can put any homework i have on school in There and i can commit to doing it when it's on my list, but i can't seem to put the comic in there, something i rly want to commit into doing.  Does anyone here have any advice with that? Im starting to get rly anxious to why i can't, i use Wunderlist to help me, any advice with that app is Also welcome.
