I would get good grades (besides math) up until the 4th grade. During 5th grade i just.... Stopped doing homework for some reason, ever since then it's been an intense battle for me attempting to do work. I've never been able to fully concentrate in class. When I was diagnosed with ADD and/or ADHD my doctor asked my parents if it was ok to put me on medication to help me with ADHD, my parents were fearful of side effects and such and refused... I really really wished they said yes to the pills.  I failed middle school and i am now currently in highschool, With the living fear that I will end up as a drop out by this time next year. My grades are terrible, F's in nearly all my classes. I don't wanna keep going thru this. I keep trying to change and do work but I keep becoming Lazy and dozing off. I keep on getting more comfortable.   Please please help me.
