52ed43a8b06f80379aa2a0b8ea289e16569bd7c936b4972fbfb39e34540b697c;;;Serious difficulty getting a diagnosis... does my life have to be falling apart for it to be ADHD??;;;I've spoken now with a doctor and a psychiatrist, and it seems they'll diagnose me with things I don't even relate to before they even consider ADHD. I've never connected with any other mental health survey better than the ones I've seen for Women with ADHD... What now? Find a new doc and be sure to memorize the symptoms in the DSM?? What do I have to do??
