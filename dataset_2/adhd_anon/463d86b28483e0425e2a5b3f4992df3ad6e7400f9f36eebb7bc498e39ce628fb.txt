463d86b28483e0425e2a5b3f4992df3ad6e7400f9f36eebb7bc498e39ce628fb;;;[Kick-Start Sunday]! - It is summer (or winter for upside/down people), lean back, and tell us how you are going to Kick Start next week!;;;  Kick-Start Sunday is where [/r/adhd](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/) shares the goals, tasks, or habits we want to accomplish this week.  You will be held gently accountable (which is a good thing!) and we can check in with you...helping YOU get things done.  *I suggest you read the whole post to be MORE successful, so put in the little extra initial effort and continue reading....*  *** ## Choose the participation method that works for you: * **Most important task** - Share one (or a couple) **HIGH-PRIORITY** tasks that you really would like to finally finish.  *(Ex. Set a doctors appointment, finish assignment, clean the kitchen...whatever YOU think is most important.)* * **Make a list** - Post a list of all the things you want to accomplish this week.  *(I highly recommend identifying the top 3 priorities.)* * **Feed your soul** - Sometimes by relaxing and having fun we have more energy to get more done. **List a couple FUN items to make your list more exciting.**  **Need/Want to copy last week's list *verbatim*?  Absolutely DO SO!**  *Those might be your keystone habits. Once you start doing those regularly you are able to do more. soon they will be automatic and you can put your focus elsewhere.*  *** By sharing our goal(s) with this understanding community, we can keep each other **accountable**...and **celebrate our successes**, large or small!  **Don’t forget to return for [Win Wedenesday] to flaunt your successes!**  ;-)  By getting one small task done it creates **momentum**, **trust** in yourself, **confidence**, and you will feel like doing more.  *** ## Suggested Guidelines * **Prioritize your list.** One thing you want to get done (or start). What is the most important thing for you? (If making a list works best for you feel free to do that too!) * **Add a finish OR start deadline.** By committing to a date/time, we can check on your progress. * **Edit your comment when done.** - Come back and edit your comment when you have finished your goal. We can celebrate that (and then people won't check on you). * **Small start.** - Share what SMALL (under 10 minutes) commitment you can make towards your goal.  *I found when my clients didn’t reach their goals 90% of the time they never started...this will help you break through the initial barrier.*  *** ## Tips * Your tasks/goals should ideally be S.M.A.R.T goals: **Specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound** * **Measurable** - Make sure you can be able to say YES I DID THIS. **Study enough** is not measurable.  Study 2 hours is. * **Break it down** - Instead of saying clean my room...it might help to say, “Clean room for 10 minutes or pick up trash in room.” * **Write it down elsewhere** - Sticky note by computer.  Google calendar.  Agenda.  Write it down so you don't forget.  Our working memories are flaky.... * **Start small...build up slowly** - We want to build on small successes so committing to cleaning your entire house might be a bit too much to handle.  Pick a room (or a task like ‘pick up dirty laundry’)  instead. * **Want to study for 2 hours a day?** *Commit to studying 30 minutes to make it easier on you.*  *** ## Examples from previous weeks: * Tidy room. * Buy car. * Go to work. * Attend all my classes on time. * Reschedule appointment. * Mornings: brush teeth &amp; meditate.  Evenings: brush teeth, meditate, journal. * Pay bills. * Plan vacation. * Go to the gym 3x this week. * Break down chores by days so I can have 'a day off with my darling' before he leaves. * **Start** *[something]*. “Spend 5 minutes on writing my paper.”  *** ## *It’s now easier to respond!  Just copy/paste the below into your comment.*  	## Daily Habit / Procrastinated Project / Soul-Feeding 	* **What?** - 	* **How much time?** - 	* **When?** - 	* **Potential Obstacles?** - 	* **Check in on me? When?** - 	* **Small Start** - 	* **Reward** - 	* **Something fun you want to do this week** - 	* **Daily Habit** -  *** Daily list template, if that suits you better.  	## Monday --   	* Item 	## Tuesday -- 	## Wednesday -- 	## Thursday -- 	## Friday -- 	## Saturday --   	## Sunday --  *** Don’t forget to **brag about your accomplishments in Win Wednesday** on Wednesday.  **Celebrating/acknowledging your wins is just as important as actually getting stuff done.**  *** **TL,DR: Share what you want to accomplish this week and how you will do it. Having people check on you via Reddit is extremely helpful!**

Share it with the rest of this community! :);;;  ##### WIN WEDNESDAY!!!  * I started Win Wednesday a long long time ago (anything over 1 year = long long time ago on ADHD time….or that could be recently...but I digress), after noticing most our support group attendees could not think of a positive win they had in the past MONTH. This surprised me and made me realize the importance of thinking about the positive things we have done (no matter how small) on a regular basis.*  **We win every single day. I challenge you to keep track of your wins this week (not just in your mind...write them down) and see if you feel better looking at the list later in the week. Don’t worry if you miss a day or two or three! Do what you can. Even writing them down one day is a win!!!**  -computerpsych  #####Science behind Win Wednesday * Scientists think our brain has a built in negativity bias by reacting more to a negative stimulus. In effect, our brain is like velcro for negative experiences and teflon for positive ones.   * Painful experiences are usually more memorable than positive ones and lasting, good relationships typically need at least a 5:1 ratio of positive to negative interactions.  * By **tilting toward the good** you are leveling the playing field.    * **Instead of positive experiences washing through you like water through a sieve, they’ll collect in the implicit memory deep down in your brain.**  * **Soak in the positive events in your life**   * By pausing and holding that positive feeling for a BIT longer, you are slowly changing the wiring of your brain.   * Much of this information comes from *The Buddha’s Brain* by Rick Hanson. Here is a PDF of his [*Positive Emotions and Taking In the Good*](http://www.rickhanson.net/wp-content/files/PositiveEmotions.pdf).  You can find more at *[rickhanson.net](http://www.rickhanson.net)*  *** Win Wednesday is a chance to focus on our accomplishments for the week. Doing this enough WILL change your brain for the better!  ###***The Sacred Creed of Win Wednesday:***  * **Each and every one of us have victories every week, be they great or small. But in Win Wednesday, *no* victory is truly a small one.**  * **Whatever "level" you happen to be at, progress is *always* a cause for celebration!**   * **Please don’t discount anything you have done. The whole point is to share how YOU won, and did not let your ADHD win!** Check out the examples to see what we mean!**  *** * The point of Win Wednesday is equally **to share our wins AND celebrate the wins of others!** If you do or don’t have a win, feel free to give positive support and cheer to those posting (not just upvoting)!  * **Each week Win Wednesday gets hundreds of views, but only 5 people replying to the winning comments...let’s change things this week!** Just saying “good job” means a lot to someone who has been struggling!  *** ##### PHENOMENAL EXAMPLES FROM PAST WEEKS:  * Started reviewing for a stats test early...beat the curve...and no longer playing catch up in math class for the first time in college (PhD student). * Went to psychiatrist, started medication, feel more ‘normal’ * Wrote an essay and DIDN’T procrastinate until the last minute (not sure if I ever did this) * Went to doctor and is one step closer to ADHD diagnosis. Waiting for psych to call back. * I can change. I can learn to have goals. I can learn to have self control, and manage my time, and connect to people. I can escape the law of entropy.  ##### We love you, /r/adhd! BE PROUD and celebrate with each other! -- *your community managers.*  #####
