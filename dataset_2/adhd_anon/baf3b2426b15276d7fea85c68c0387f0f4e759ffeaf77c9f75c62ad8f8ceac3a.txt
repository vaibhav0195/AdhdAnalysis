I stopped by my mom's and was hanging out with her as she was getting ready for a date. She mentioned how busy she was and that there were two mechanics coming over to look at the washing machine right before she was supposed to be leaving. As I was watching tv and eating leftovers with my mom, brother (who lives with her), and son, we heard the doorbell rang. On autopilot (kinda spaced out, you know how it is), I got up to answer the door. I opened the big entryway door and looked through the screen door at the two strangers in blue overalls standing there. I took my last bite of enchiladas, decided (apparently) that neither of the gentlemen were terribly attractive or interesting, and, curiosity sated, went to rinse out my bowl in the kitchen. When I got back to my mom and brother, they were looking at me expectantly. "Did you answer the door?" they asked. As the slight confusion on my face gave way to a look of realization at the absurdity of what I'd done, my brother just laughed ran to let them in. Thank goodness for understanding family! We've been giggling about it all day - having a girl answer the door and look you over as she eats Mexican food and then abruptly walking off without letting you in would be pretty strange!  Does anyone else have any weird and funny stories about the crazy hijinks their brains have gotten them into (or out of)? I can think of a ton of impulsive and unintentionally rude things that I've said or done that are hilarious after the shock has worn off, and I would love to hear everyone's experiences!
