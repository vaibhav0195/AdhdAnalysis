It's been amazing and life-changing. I've excelled at work and escaped a lot of foggy years where I felt like a failure.  I just got a voicemail from my doctor's office saying they got a heads up that coverage was being suspended due to an investigation of a pre-existing condition. The message said this wasn't unusual, but that I needed to respond to a letter I would get. Later in the day, I got two calls to my Google Voice from what I think is Blue Shield, saying to contact my provider at their 800 number.  Before I contact them, I'm really hoping to get advice on how to proceed. Insurance is so scary and I feel like a miss step could screw up my coverage. I just started getting my feet back on the ground financially and I won't be able to cover this myself.   I've never been diagnosed before, but over five years ago in another state I told a general physician that I was struggling with focus and he prescribed a stimulant to try. It didn't work for me and I didn't follow up on it. Does insurance have access to information like that? I don't even remember that doctor's name. Would they consider that diagnosis even though he wasn't a psychiatrist and there was no measurement of any kind?  Has anyone dealt with this before? I want to have my ducks in a row before I follow-up with my insurance company. I feel so deeply discouraged.
