Of course, I plan to visit a neurologist as I do not necessarily trust self-diagnosis.  But it got me thinking, how at 17 years old I still cannot manage to brush my teeth on a regular schedule (I forget).  Or take showers every day.  I also cannot remember for the life of me to put deodorant on.  I forget to cut my fingernails for months on end, and I am a guy.  I am just guessing here but who knows, I am really just looking for some consolidation.  I mean I would go to the dentist and they would say for years, "You know how much this costs?" and "Gum disease will be inevitable and is linked to many other types of diseases, and increases the risk of a heart attack," and as much as it frightened me nothing changed.  Hell every time I was in that dentist's chair I would say to myself I would figure it out.  And I never did.  I simply could not remember, even if I used methods of reminding myself.  As soon as I saw the reminder on my phone, the thought would be out to the void again.       It really leads me to wonder if something neurological is going on with this.  Have any of you who have been diagnosed experienced these issues, or have children who have?
