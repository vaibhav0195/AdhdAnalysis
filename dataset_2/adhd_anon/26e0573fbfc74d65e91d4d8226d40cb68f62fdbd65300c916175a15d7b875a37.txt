26e0573fbfc74d65e91d4d8226d40cb68f62fdbd65300c916175a15d7b875a37;;;It's really difficult for me to visualize;;;I read about an exercise where you can kind of test to see if you're in control of your brain or not.  Basically you just close your eyes and try to see if you can make 10 shots in a row.  So I tried this just now and was able to make all 10 shots, however they weren't all swishes and there were a lot of nonsensical things going on that wouldn't really be there like weird shapes and colors and changing "camera angles" probably due to my add.  I'm thinking if I could somehow practice and be able to get rid of all the random mental distractions when visualizing, it would help my thinking and my life in a lot of ways.  This doesn't happen only when I'm trying to visualize of course, it happens when I'm doing tasks such as memorizing as well.  Does anyone have any suggestions for me or find themselves in the same boat?  Additional information: I'm 22 years old and was diagnosed with adhd when I was in 3rd grade and took ritalin for about a year and my parents and I decided I would be better off not taking it because of how much it altered my personality, etc.  Thanks.  Edit: if anyone's wondering, I will start doing meditation and following [these exercises.](http://litemind.com/how-to-develop-visualization-skill/)
