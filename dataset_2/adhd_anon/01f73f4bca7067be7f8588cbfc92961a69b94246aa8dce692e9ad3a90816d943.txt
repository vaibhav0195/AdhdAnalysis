01f73f4bca7067be7f8588cbfc92961a69b94246aa8dce692e9ad3a90816d943;;;I Hate Moving....;;;...Mostly because I don't feel like I have FINISHED anything!  I have spent 2 days wandering around my new house. I got a LOT done, but it felt so chaotic.  I tried to put stuff away in the Kitchen, half loaded the dishwasher, left the fridge open while I was washing dishes, started 3 different garbage bags because I forgot about the one before, forgot to actually EAT for 2 days (thankfully other family members DO get hungry now and then and remind me). I also have to constantly focus because I hoard. I have had to keep telling myself "IF we need that (likely unused for more than a year small item) we are financially stable enough to replace it" so I can purge the multiple multiples of things we do not have space for as well.  Having ADHD is hard, trying to function in an unfamiliar environment is hard, trying to make SO MANY decisions on how to set things up or not changing my mind 5 mins later about where I want the cake mix to go has been Mentally exhausting.  after 4 days, I am ready to go back to work where someone tells me what I have to do and when again so I don't have to think about things!  But I have a bed to sleep on that is made, I have a kitchen table (for the first time in 5 chaotic years), I have internet (because I gave my 19 yr old son the job of getting that set up), I actually have my car IN the garage and I have a fantastic view of the fall colored trees in the neighborhood. I HAVE accomplished so much...My brain just hurts with all the thinking.
