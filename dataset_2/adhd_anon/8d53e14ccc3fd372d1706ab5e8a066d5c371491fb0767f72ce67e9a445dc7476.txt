I was diagnosed pretty young with ADHD and was medicated with Adderall up until I was 14, to which I made the decision to stop. I decided to start up again (22) and got a prescription to strattera. Now I'm having some pretty bad side effects. I'm two days in, and my testicles are constantly aching, and I haven't pissed right since I started.  Obviously maintaining an erection is almost impossible. Are these side effects that eventually go away?
