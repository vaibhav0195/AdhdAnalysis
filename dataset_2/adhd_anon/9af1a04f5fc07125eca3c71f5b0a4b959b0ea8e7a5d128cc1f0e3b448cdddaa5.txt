I was never diagnosed, though. My parents seemed to shrug off all symptoms of the illness due to my dad having severe ADHD problems and not being diagnosed/treated. It has always been a running joke. "Oh, you're just like you father!" Therefore, proper treatment was never sought. I lost my insurance the day I turned 18, so I was unable to seek help for myself. After being uninsured for six years, I was finally able to qualify for a decent healthcare plan through my state. The first thing I did was make an appointment with a psychiatrist to try and tackle these issues with attention problems along with severe anxiety and depression. My question is: How were you officially diagnosed? My doctor did not tell me if I have ADHD or ADD. He didn't screen me. He did prescribe me adderall, however. I've only been taking it for a day, but it seems to be helping a little. Any feedback is much appreciated. Thanks!
