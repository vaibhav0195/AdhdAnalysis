f3c8f57480130f86efa3067da4901fd256ea0347e399b385de5b335717aa1c0a;;;I met with a doctor who specializes in ADD/ADHD last week. He is a big proponent of a QEEG test to determine whether I actually have ADD and which type I have. My test is tomorrow. Is this a good diagnostic test, or a way for him to make some extra insurance money?;;;The questionnaire I had to fill out basically felt like I was reading my biography, and my wife said that there weren't high enough numbers on the form that she filled out for some of the questions about my behavior.  The doctor said he felt pretty sure about my diagnosis, but wanted to do the test to "be scientifically sure." I haven't had much time to do any research about a QEEG test for ADD, but I know it's a fairly new thing. Anyone have any feedback or advice or experience with this new way of diagnosing ADD?
