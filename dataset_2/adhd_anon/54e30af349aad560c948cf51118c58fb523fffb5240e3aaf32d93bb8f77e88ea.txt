Tl;DR AT THE BOTTOM!**   **Personal note**: I was diagnosed at 7 and refused to take medicine. I adopted several helpful, albeit unusual, coping mechanisms to help me adapt in school, work, and social exchanges. I've now been on Adderall (10mg 2x day) for 1 year and it has helped tremendously with the "brain chatter" and "channel flipping". I can't believe I went nearly 18 years without it. The first day I took it and drove to campus as per usual. Upon arrival, my friend noted that I *'looked peaceful'* and I was. It has been nothing but helpful, but I know that the coping mechanisms I developed previously are also a huge help.  Before I was medicated, I adopted color coded stickie notes, multiple white boards, repeated lists in every notebook, and multiple phone reminders. I got through the first semester of my return on sheer willpower (and reminders!) alone. I was home schooled previously and didn't do so well when I was younger. Now I am part of 2 on campus clubs, taking 16-18+ credit hours, conducting neurodevelopmental research, URL (undergraduate research leaders), ESA (Engaged scholarship award), and still somehow find time to make the President's list [straight A's!] Through time and hard work, my 2.4 has risen to a 3.1 and I'm on track to graduate with honors. I was already on track to do so without the medicine, but the medicine helps a lot. The important thing, in my mind, is to know that I can, and have, do without. *Medicine is not a magic 'fix all' pill*, and I wish more people understood that.    **Backstory of Problem**: My BF's brother is a medical graduate from Mexico and is a fully licensed and legal doctor (in Mexico). The U.S. has unusual requirements and earning a license here can be a pain, but he was born here and simply went to Mexico due to cost - a risk, but he's happy with his decision. He's been having difficulty studying. He prefers video games and socializing with his wife, usual stuff. I heard through the grapevine that he was interested in trying Adderall because he's "heard amazing things" and "feels like he might have ADHD".   This was originally offensive to me because he definitely does not have ADHD. I know adderall can be prescribed for a variety of reasons, and I am trying hard to not be judgemental, but he doesn't lack the ability to retrieve large amounts of information, or forget necessities/basic every-day responsibilities, doesn't experience hardships with impulse control, had no idea what "brain chatter" was, has a ridiculously solid attention span, and just *clearly* does not have ADHD.  Not to imply that people with ADD/ADHD aren't intelligent or articulate, but their family specifically is abnormally smart. So, I met with him to help him study - ADHD or not, learning some studying tips is beneficial! I attempted to take a proactive route instead of getting bitter.  During the study session, he explained his issues, concerns, how his brain works (my questioning, he is very open), and previous study tactics. I offered a few suggestions and they were met with:  - "yeah, no. I don't like doing that because...." - "See, I tried that before when I was younger...." - "No, I don't want to do that". - "I'm not willing to try that".  It then finished with "I really think the Adderall will help me do what I need to do". Okay, can't argue with the Dr. I did warn him about the possibility of medication induced psychosis, but he's aware, he's a fucking Dr! Okay, fine, this is his decision. He finally admitted that he does not have ADHD but thinks he would benefit from adderall as "a boost". He's under the impression that Adderall will *make him do what he doesn't want to do*.    I politely tell him that I disagree, but at the end of the day it is his life. So he goes and "fills his script", which interestingly enough, a P.A signed off on. I at that point didn't believe that he actually went to see a Dr, because where I live, P.A's are not allowed to prescribe schedule 2 drugs. This is not something I can or will argue, but it fuels my fire.  **CUT SCENE to 3 days on his script / THE PROBLEM**  My BF, BF's brother, their mother, and the brother's wife and were all at the mother's house. For half an hour I am sitting there hearing about how wonderful and great Adderall is, how he's been so productive, cleaned his desk, and just feels like superman overall. In the middle of his spiel, he says that on Monday and Wednesday he's not going to take his pills so that he "can feel like himself". In addition, those days that he isn't taking the Adderall, he's going to give to *his wife* so that *"she can join [him] in the gym"*.   Okay, so what happens if you stop taking the Adderall, do you stop being productive? Do you stop going to the gym? Do you stop doing what you need to do because you're out of Adderall? *NO.*  The conversation then moves forward where there is A TOAST to Adderall. A FUCKING TOAST! They all clink their glasses and are so happy that Mr. Dr is finally doing what he needs to do and thanks the Adderall for it. Nevermind that on Adderall he could have chosen to be unproductive, lets celebrate the fucking drugs and not his recent boost in productivity and willingness to do what needs to get done.   **Tl;DR**: Very articulate and well read Dr Admits to not having ADHD but receives a script for Adderall anyway in order to get a 'boost', has no interest in developing other coping mechanisms, got the script incorrectly, takes days off "to feel like himself", shares his script with his wife so she will "join [him] at the gym", and the entire family TOASTED to adderall^clink while I'm sitting there dumbfounded.   ..... am I just being sensitive?!
