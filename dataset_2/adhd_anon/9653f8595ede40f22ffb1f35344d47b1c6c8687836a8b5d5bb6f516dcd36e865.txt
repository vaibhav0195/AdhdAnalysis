So for like tests and stuff I absolutely can concentrate. It's incredibly fucking difficult and I have to take a break to daydream halfway through every time but I can do it. The problem is how fucking much fucking effort it is. It takes EVERY little bit of willpower I have to do and afterwards I actually usually pass out.  All throughout my GCSE's (final high school exams) I would skip lessons to take naps behind the drama stage after exams afterwards I would literally feel so fucking exhausted like I'd been up for days.  Since I started college I've spent so much time putting effort into studying and homework (it takes me 3-4 hours to do something it takes classmates 1 hour) that I nap for an hour when I get home and sleep for 9 hours a night otherwise I'm exhausted all the time (also severe depression and anxiety but that comes with it).  Anyone else feel like this? Oh yeah I'm unmedicated, been diagnosed multiple times by different doctors since I was six.  TL;DR Anyone able to concentrate if they expend all their willpower and feel fucking exhausted for doing so?
