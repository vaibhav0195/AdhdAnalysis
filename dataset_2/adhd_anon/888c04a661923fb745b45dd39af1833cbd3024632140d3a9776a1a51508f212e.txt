I've been put on a therapeutic trial of methylphenidate, and have been on it for 2 weeks now I'm on 20 mg in morning 20 mg about 3-4 hours later. Started at only 10mg in morning then built it up over 2 day periods, so day 1-2 10 mg AM, day 3-4 20 mg AM, day 5-6 20 mg AM and 10 3-4 hours later, day 7-now 20 mg AM 20 mg 3-4 hours later.  My problem is that I'm not directly noticing the effects for example I don't get what my psychiatrist described as filter added to everything (though I think he described it as a fish bowl or something)   I notice that my concentration is somewhat increased but I still notice stuff in my peripheral vision and most noise, though it doesn't *seem* to affect me as much. I don't feel tired as much, and feel a lot more motivated whilst at work although not so much at home.  Not sure if it helps in social situations as I haven't had much chance to test it out (I like to socialise but people don't like to with me due to secondary school and people bullying/spreading rumours about me)  The one thing I'm noticing is when the effects start wearing off but as this happens over a while I can't say what is being helped and what isn't.  I do have the option to go up to 60 mg a day, should I do this?  TL;DR: Worried that my psychiatrist may change the diagnosis which means I don't know what's up and this worries me massively. I'm hoping that someone could weigh in and give some advice/help.  Sorry if this rambled a bit and for the terrible grammar.
