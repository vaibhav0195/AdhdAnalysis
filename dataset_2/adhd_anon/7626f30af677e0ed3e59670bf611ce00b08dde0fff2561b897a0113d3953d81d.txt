7626f30af677e0ed3e59670bf611ce00b08dde0fff2561b897a0113d3953d81d;;;CAMH;;;i was told that adult ADHD services were not provided at CAMH and i was recommended to search for services oriented towards generalized with ADHD support or ADHD specified/focused either OHIP covered or private elsewhere. i declined services that were focused on mood or anxiety based disorders as ADHD was priority. i was given a list of places to go and that was that.   i read numerous posts and feedback of people that mentioned they were getting help at CAMH. it was implied to be for adult ADHD but i could be misinterpreting, would if be for other conditions or was i misdirected?
