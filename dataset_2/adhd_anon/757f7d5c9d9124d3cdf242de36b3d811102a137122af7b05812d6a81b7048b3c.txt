(Not sure if this is the right place);;;So I don't know if this is the proper place to post this because I have no idea where to post this. I'm 18 and a high school senior, diagnosed with ADHD-PI about 6 years ago. This has been bugging me a lot recently, especially when looking at and applying to colleges. I have no idea what I want or what I like. Everyone around me seems to have interests and hobbies they can go on about and have an idea about where they want to go and what they want to do with their life, but I have no god damn idea.  I kind of just go with the flow through life. I'm mildly content, but I think this problem is going to make it difficult when it comes to making decisions in the near future.
