We only kissed, we were too drunk -luckily-. I've wanted to kiss him for that half year, and finally I did it.  And I should realize it didn't mean anything, we were drunk, had fun, but it was only for once for him.  But Jesus Christ, I'm really obsessing over that guy. Thinking about him, wanting him to send me a message, all that stuff. I don't even know if I like the guy. He's nice and good looking, but maybe not really my type?  It just feels like a distraction from my schoolwork, which I have to sort out on my own for this week and the beginning of next week, so I'd rather do something else.. like obsessing over the guy. And I hate it, why can't I be normal and just 'see what happens'?  And because I'm like this I'm afraid to go to events he will be at as well.  Maybe anyone else experiencing the same thing? Or any advice how to get back to my schoolwork, and not checking Facebook all the damn time?  I'm sorry this is just a stupid story and not something contributing to the community, but I have to get this off my chest.  Cheers!  Edit: and oh yeah, I feel like he doesn't talk to me because I'm stupid/ugly/whatever. I know this is an anxiety and I'm gonna get treatment for it, but I want some tips how I can ease 'the pain'.
