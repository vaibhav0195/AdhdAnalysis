a0b8df1d8cd48fbffd971c7e678169e870e31e235ab6beec150f3d0cd5b423f7;;;Really need to get it out;;;I've finally been diagnosed with ADHD-PI this Jan after months of struggling in college. The diagnose helped to explain years of my behaviours and in a way a relief knowing what's wrong with me and the way I feel. I've been struggling years with emotional problems and it wasn't until recently that I had finally find a way to deal with it. I go to a very competitive school and for the first two years I did managed okay. When things started getting harder, I had no way to cope. I don't have the skills, I never study in my life, I didn't know what to do. I failed two courses in summer school, late withdrawal for all my last term classes. In Jan, I was diagnosed and prescribed with Concerta. For a while, it worked and then it stopped working. I was left feeling confused, tired and my thoughts only lasted for secs before they escaped. I was so mentally handicapped, sitting in front of my laptop, breaking down, desperately trying to write something. I started vayanse this week, so far it is working. But I didn't hang in one paper and didn't have time to write another one. Maybe I will fail my courses this term again. The struggle is really painful, you are always trying to play catch up. You fell, pick yourself up again and keep trying. I am so ashamed of my failure, I can't tell anyone. A lot of ADHDers are also struggling and it really helps a lot knowing that you are not alone.
