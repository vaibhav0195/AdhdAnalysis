126dec55340b8e40fa4974bc2f03588a425e2de43df2956ddc324e5ee80b97d4;;;Started seeing an LCSW that says she 'strongly suspects ADHD-PI'. Is that not a diagnosis?;;;I've seen this LCSW 2 times, and she suspects ADHD-PI and anxiety. Not really sure what comes next though, next appt is in a week. The way she said she 'suspects' made me think she couldn't give me the official diagnosis yet. I'm hoping I can get diagnosed and eventually medicated.   But do LCSW's need to refer for further evaluation, or can they render a diagnosis that could be referred for medication?    Any help in understanding the process is appreciated, thanks.
