Ex-saying if he has a bad day in school that night that he shouldn't go trick or treating to or a school fall festival on that night. I disagree.;;;So right now, I'm in this texting session with her. Shes saying that she wouldn't let him going to this Fall Festival at school if he messes up tomorrow. And more, if he has a bad day on Halloween she wouldn't let him go trick or treating.   He is not diagnosed yet, but shows every sign and it runs in the family. So, he's not medicated or under an behavioral therapy yet. How do I explain to her that I agree with being disciplined, but to take away something like these things before we even have a proper diagnoses or take other steps is wrong and will just hurt him down the lines?  TL;DR Ex wife thinks taking away Halloween if child has bad day of school is okay, and I'm not sure. What do you say?
