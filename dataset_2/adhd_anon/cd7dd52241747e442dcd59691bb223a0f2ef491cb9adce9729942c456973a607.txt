(UK Question);;;Hi, So i'll cut to the chase, i know i have ADD, for sure, i am not going to discuss why, but i am certain of it (also brother has it diagnosed)  I went to a university counsellor, who wanted to test me for dyslexia, and told them i am not dyslexic, but insisted. And turns out i'm not... suprise. So i went to my GP who told me she doesn't know anything about it, so took bloods (for some reason) to ensure all my hormone levels are right? She referred me to a better GP (who still doesn't know anything about ADHD) who said "sorry although i know you have it, i can't diagnose you under the NHS as you are an adult, but if you go private they will diagnose you"  Absolutely ridiculous. Now he has referred me to psychiatrist but i am going to be waiting six months. I do not know what to do, and how i go about looking into private diagnosis and costs.  I have been taking my brothers concerta XL which has been working incredible for me at university and has changed my life. Unfortunately i run out and have gone back to being shit@life. I never told them i have had a short supply otherwise they will think that i rely on it/addicted/illegally taking it.  I don't know what to do, thanks in advance.
