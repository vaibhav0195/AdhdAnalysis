Having this medication has helped me tremendously! I got into the best physical shape of my life and made a career change for the better. I recently moved and my new doctor is not super thrilled about me taking Adderall, which apparently is the norm in the new state I live in. She recommended me to a neuropsychologist for adult ADHD screening so I get an "official" diagnosis from testing, and wants that doctor to prescribe me the medicine. It will take a few hours to test. I have no idea what this will entail. Has anyone gotten this testing done before? I have no doubt I have ADHD but I am just curious to what to expect.
