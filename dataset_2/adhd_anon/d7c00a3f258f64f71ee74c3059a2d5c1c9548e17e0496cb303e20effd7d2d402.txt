d7c00a3f258f64f71ee74c3059a2d5c1c9548e17e0496cb303e20effd7d2d402;;;Need advice/insight;;;So I'm 24/M  I have been diagnosed since childhood with ADHD and PDD-NOS, the latter I did not know about until age 20, read a report in my hospital records while waiting to go into surgery.  I.. honestly don't know how to deal with it or still accept it of having a form of autism, not that I feel retarded or anything, just pressurized and confused, since my parents treat me like I can't do stuff on my own, ever..  I just don't know how to deal with it, even though I wiki'd what it was about in full.. and everything is pretty accurate, I don't like social situations at all, let alone deal with huge crowds, I don't like to talk to people, I have to force myself to smile and conversate.. It frustrates me, because at some point I want to have a relationship, be more outgoing than introverted, I almost never socialize with family either, just keep to myself in my room and only go out for food, drinks and bathroom breaks..   So TL;DR - How do I get to accept myself, what I have and how do I turn all that is negative to positive energy?
