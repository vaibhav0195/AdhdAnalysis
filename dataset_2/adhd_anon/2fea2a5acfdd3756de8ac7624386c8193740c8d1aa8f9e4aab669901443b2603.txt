There appears to be some consensus among psychologists that climate change is so difficult for us, as a species, to deal with because it doesn't trigger the mechanisms that motivate us to take action.  There's more to it than this, but, basically, the consequences of our behaviour take a long time to become apparent when we're tackling climate change. And, there's no immediate, obvious, personal danger, nor any reward or punishment for [using public transport/not turning down the heating/...] so we find it difficult to really motivate ourselves to do these things we're told will really benefit our environment.  It's like everyone *knows* what will happen if they don't take action **now**, but, for some reason, it just doesn't feel like it's really affecting us, sooo... we just... don't deal with it.   Is climate change screwing over the human race by not triggering the mechanisms that motivate us to action in the same way that the delayed consequences that occur every day screw over we with ADHD?
