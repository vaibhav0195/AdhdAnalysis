Mine was too good to get diagnosed...;;;They noted some bad symptoms I have that could be linked to ADHD, however, they thought my lack of attention wasn't severe enough to get diagnosed. For those of you that have been diagnosed, how much does your inattentiveness affect your daily lives? How bad does it have to be in order to get diagnosed?  Me:  1. Hate driving, too hard to keep track of all the traffic, signs and at the same time driving the right way  2. Forget to turn off my stove at least one a week  3. Forget bus card, go home to get it. Realize I forgot wallet, so I pick that one up and forget my bus card  4. Often drifting away in conversations, not listening to a word I hear for a few seconds  5. Someone can tell me they strained their ankle. 1 minute later I ask her if she wanna go for a run  6. Sending a simple email can take an eternity as I sometimes just lose track of what I'm doing and have to read it over and over  To me this seems pretty damn accurate symptoms of inattentiveness. The fact that I procastrinate/sleep/browse the web 70+ % of the work day and still manage to do my work in those other 30 % seems functional to them. I'm just lucky I can use this strategy and still keep the job.  What are your opinions? How bad does it have to be to get diagnosed?
