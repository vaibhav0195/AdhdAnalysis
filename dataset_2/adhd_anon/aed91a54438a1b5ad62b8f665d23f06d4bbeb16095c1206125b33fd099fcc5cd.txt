aed91a54438a1b5ad62b8f665d23f06d4bbeb16095c1206125b33fd099fcc5cd;;;Anyone knows this feel? (ADD);;;Know that feel when you NEVER follow in class? like out of 2 hours,you'll listen for 5 min max because your mind keeps wandering all the time  Go to the library without anything to distract you,after 3 hours you managed to read 2 pages (because you can't concentre, you keep thinking about unrelated **** mid reading so you have to start all over again 9237912743 times, even when you force yourself it doesnt get in)  When someone gives you instructions, you always had to ask them 28467826428 questions to get it while everyone else understood the instructions.  Cant count the number of times i asked questions retarded questions (because the teacher apparently kept explaining it over and over again in class) to a teacher because i couldnt listen during class (My physic 3 teacher and my calculus 2 teacher legit thought i was retarded or something)  Always have to ask team mates/class mates about what's going on, what to do, at a certain moment they get pissed and **** so many frustrating ****s  and when you talk about that to a family member/friend, he will say: ''that happens to everyone'' I'm sure it happens to everyone once in a while but not all the ****ing time, the only time i can actually work normally is when an exam is like 2-3 days away. I'll be able to concentrate  OR when people say ' ''ADD ISNT REAL, YOU JUST NEED SELF-DISCIPLINE DUHHH'', i knew i had problems concentrating and organizing for years,read alot of books,audio tapes on self discipline,tried my best at staying constant but i always ended up failing , it never worked more than a day and it never helped me to pay attention in class. I became awared about ADD like 4 months ago, i didn't know what it was before, just thought i had the ****test self discipline on earth. I still managed to have a 82% average in college despite all that (99% of my studying/paper writing was done 2-3 days before the dead line or the exam date)   Anyone knows that feel? and anyone got treated? The neuropsy wrote a report to my doc in the which she advices him to give me ''stratera'' which isnt a neurostimulant unlike aderall and ****. It takes weeks for you to see the effects, did it work for anyone? Ive seen reviews about medication online, some say it was a life saver,made them go from 2.5 gpa to 4.0 gpa,they became very organized. Others felt empty inside/depressed
