(not completely due to ADHD, she just got a house and has major depression issues, so it just worked out better this way for now) I've been job hunting for a couple months, and I just got my first callback for an interview with a life insurance company.  It's not really something I've ever really considered, I just put my number down at a job fair, so I'm a little skeptical that it's even a real job and not just a way to sell me or something.   Any advice is welcome: Interview/sales/insurance, I need it all!  PS  I'm down to my last two adderall.... I've been rationing it for 3 months. I'll take one before my interview and hopefully be able to get a little money for a refill before (hopefully) starting the job.
