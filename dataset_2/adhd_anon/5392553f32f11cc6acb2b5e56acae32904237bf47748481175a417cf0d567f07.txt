Got diagnosed at 22, started treatment recently.  I guess the Wellbutrin works and while I feel it's working, it also just makes me realise how much I screwed up until now.  All my choices were made impulsively; I studied something I wasn't particularly interested in (but piqued my interest at the time), I just scooted by in high school based on raw intelligence, all the while being actually studious about anything outside of school, my choice of high school was a mistake also made impulsively, I picked a college in a different country and now I'm in the Netherlands with no real friends it seems and no real reason to be here other than a few design gigs and a boring job.   What I studied actually didn't involve any studying at all (just making, design), and I miss this dearly, because I was always a big reader and enjoyed getting into the nitty-gritty.   And now I want to go to med school, which makes so much sense, looking back at how and why I did my projects, and the things I was interested in.  And the idea sounds so cool if not silly, I could be both a designer and a physician (whatever that combination can result in), but while excited, I'm scared to go back to school for another 6 years (med school in Europe lasts 6 years), away from home. Then again, studying something that is actually a challenge and interesting could be enough incentive, but the prospect of loneliness scares me.  I'm 23 now, but I can't shake the *feeling* that it is, actually, too late and that I screwed up my start so bad that there's no way to get myself out of this rut.   TL;DR: ADHD-PI rant, started Wellbutrin, realising my life's kind of a mess, have plans but scared it's too late
