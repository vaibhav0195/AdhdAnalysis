Due to the nature of this drug, i am scheduled pickup once a month and am not due again until 25th March.  I do not want to call my psych to ask him what to do as im not sure of his reaction (was on ritalin for 2 years and have been on dex for 1 year, without ever asking for my meds early [i do not use to abuse])  Im thinking that perhaps 1 week off my meds cant be all that bad...? or can it?  Any tips of hints would be awesome as to how to stay 'sane' during this time. Will i go crazy? Unsure of what to expect.  Thanks in advance!
