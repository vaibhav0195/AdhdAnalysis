She actually interviewed me and my parents in a process that took almost 3 hours to complete and diagnosed me with ADHD-H, putting me on 30mg of Vyvanse and providing monthly coaching. She also advised me to write a small journal reporting all the psychological and physiological changes that I noticed upon myself after starting medication.  I actually wrote that journal and made it available in [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0Ou8Ssi41MHY1A4algtZk44M2M/view?usp=sharing). I turned to this community in times which I was completely desperate and desolate and received nothing but help in return. Treatment is now changing my life and I wanted to make this information available so other people may also benefit from this or acquire more knowledge in this topic.  I also have to say thanks again for everyone in this community for supporting me over the past 2 months and making me understand my own issues and limitations. I know that I'm now just starting to get better but damn it feels good to not run around my house for 4 hours!
