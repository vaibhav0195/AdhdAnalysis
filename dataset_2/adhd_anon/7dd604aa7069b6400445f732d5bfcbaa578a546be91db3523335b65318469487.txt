It kind of made sense that I had it because when I was in university it was hard to stay motivated to study. Like most people with ADHD, I can't focus/lack of concentration, I have trouble staying motivated to talk while conversating, I don't have as much motivation to go out to maintain relationships, I'm always disorganized, I have trouble remembering stuff, etc.  Even though I have the symptoms of ADHD, it just doesn't actually feel like I have it or maybe I'm just in denial. I've watched videos about people explaining what having ADHD feels like and yeah I feel like I fit some of it, but not all of it.   Videos like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GBMS7WPFSs  So my question is - say I was misdiagnosed, if I continue to take my ADHD meds what could possibly happen?  EDIT: Another question - how do you know that you actually have ADHD and that you're just not lazy or trying hard enough? ( this question isn't meant to offend anyone, I genuinely would like to know)
