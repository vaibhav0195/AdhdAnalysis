f265ca2935ab608fc5fba2f8c2e57898bbef4c11fadb5d170f9b1ce5a4c852d6;;;I'm looking for people to share their experience with atomoxetine;;;So after years of being pretty sure that I have ADHD, it became a little too much to manage and I finally went in for a diagnosis from a psychiatrist. He asked me a lot of questions and by the end of the session he agreed with me, we talked about the different medications and he asked me what I wanted to take.  I have tried adderall, ritalin and every variation on those chemicals before and I know they work well for me but I have never even met anyone on Atomoxetine. I'm a little concerned about the long term effects on the brain and cardiovascular system with taking a stimulant on a daily basis so I jumped at an opportunity to try a non-stimulant alternative. The only thing is that I know practically nothing about this drug so I was just wondering if anyone has experience that they care to share.  Thanks.
