For example: -You have an addiction such as Internet, video games, social media, or porn. This can zap your dopamine levels and cause ADHD like symptoms. -You are deficient in vitamins or other hormones. -You don't eat healthy and don't get the proper nutrition for your brain to function properly. -You don't exercise enough. -Etc Etc.  I'm not saying this applies to any of you, but maybe it does.   Maybe instead of medication to treat the imbalances of chemicals in our brain, all we really need is a lifestyle change.  I really don't want to be taking adderall for the rest of my life. This is why I'm going to be creating a case study in a few weeks. Doing a complete lifestyle change and not taking any medicine.  Let me know your thoughts. Has anyone else changed their lifestyle for the better and gotten ride of ADHD symptoms?
