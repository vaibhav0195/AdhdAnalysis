a36de9b8ad06ff3eafedcf5c2206fab129f8b55f7e5d85d911323bac3089e708;;;ADHD Survey;;;I'm doing a research project about abnormal psychology and it's interrelation to concepts. I'd like to invite all of you to participate in a survey which specifically targets ADD/ADHD. You do not need to have ADD/ADHD to participate in the survey. The survey will take between 5 and 30 minutes. Please answer honestly as honest answers gives us better data. Thanks in advance to everyone who takes this survey!  [Link to the survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/ADHDV001)  EDIT: I want to provide a bit of an update concerning the structure of the survey. I've addressed the concerns of the survey takers in the comments, but I'm going to re-present them here. These were the design goals of the survey:  * To maximize the presentation of instructions to those taking it. Frequently people with ADHD will skip over instructions if they are long. Additionally, conditionals were placed at the end of sentences to force participants to read the entire sentence. This is likely to cause frustrations as it inhibits scanning and skipping, but it was felt to be necessary.  * To be vague. Our theory is that difficulties with the concept of a situation create ADHD. Theses questions are set up so that people with ADHD will stumble while people without it will eventually be able to give a specific answer to it. In other words, we fully anticipate that people with ADHD will have difficulty understanding some of the questions or what we're looking for. That is, it's the result we're looking for.  * ADD was included because of the age ranges. It was not uncommon for people to be referred to as ADD but not ADHD in the 80s. Children who were considered ADD would sit calmly at their desks in school but not be able to focus. As a result, they were much harder to spot than children who were hyperactive.
