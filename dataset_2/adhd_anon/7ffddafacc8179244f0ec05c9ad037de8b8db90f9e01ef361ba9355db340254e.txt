Appreciate any input.;;; Hey, I’m a 22 year old female and I have not been diagnosed with ADHD but I believe I may be the inattentive type. I’ve researched a lot but the criteria can be really vague. So I have put some traits I think may be ADHD (inattentive type) but aren’t exactly covered in the DSM and other ADHD tests and would greatly appreciate any input at all. I am going to see someone on the 8th to get a proper exam, but I also just wanna see If other people are like this.   1.	Browsing an interesting topic on the web, and as you are reading the information other interesting topics (which may or may not be related to the original topic) come up and you click on them or google them and start reading about those topics without finishing the first, and then finding more and jumping to those new interesting topics. The end result being you do not finish any topic almost before moving on to another page and having a cascade of half-read tabs (I can between 5  and 20) up at once, until you get bored or tired and stop opening new topics and scan quickly through the tabs already up. 2.	Not being able to tune out outside noise, especially when focusing on something you need to concentrate on like homework or paperwork or understanding something complicated, any noise or movement is an intense distraction and makes it impossible to keep focused on the task. (I have better luck if I have music on, but only if the music isn’t new and interesting to me, but rather music I like but have listened to many times before, so it’s predictable). 3.	If your senses are bombarded with stimulus (a lot of noise, a lot of commotion and chaos, a lot of sights), especially if action, work, or concentration  is required of you, do you zone out because it’s too hard to work with so much going on? Do you zone out or start thinking about unrelated stuff when you are overwhelmed and overloaded? 4.	When talking to someone, especially when you are trying to make a case or bring up a point, do you stop halfway through a point or thought, because another point came up in your mind that you then turn to without completing the first thought (new thought is more interesting, you don’t want to forget the new thought, etc)? Gets to the point where there a lot of half-finished points and you have to go back to a previous point to finish it, and it ends up being very disorganized, not very well planned out, and all over the place?  I’m sorry for the length, I didn’t want to leave out any important information, but thank you so much for taking the time to read :)  tl;dr:  I have these traits which aren’t specifically in the DSM but I think might indicate I have ADHD inattentive type, please let me know if you do or don’t have these traits : 1. Having many browser tabs open and ‘reading’ several tabs at once 2. Can’t tune our noises to focus 3. Zone out or get lost in thought when overwhelmed or bombarded by senses. 4. In conversation moving to a new point without finishing the current point several times, makes it hard to form a well-structured and paced argument/point  Thank you ^^

I have to call him to tell him which dose works best for me, but I only get 3 days on the 60 and it's hard for me to tell that quickly if I think it's too high for me or not (though I guess if I"m not in a terrible state maybe it's ok.) I don't know what symptoms to look for besides focusing too much, being incredibly irritable, or feeling like a zombie (I don't feel like that, just more tired but I think that's just my insomnia acting up). I figure there has to be other cues, especially more subtle ones, to keep an eye out.  .   So my question. **Have you ever been on too high a dose of vyvanse** (even if later you had to push it up to that dose later), like if you were titrating and found out a lesser dose was better, **and what did you experience that you knew it was too much?**   .  Also a tack on if you care to answer too: **what was the best thing you did/changed to get the best effects from your medication** (maybe certain eating patterns, way you take it, etc). Thanks for any assistance, I really appreciate it :)  .   **tl;dr:** I have to tell my psychiatrist which dose of Vyvanse is best for me and not sure how to tell if 60 is too high for me. Have you been on a too high dose of Vyvanse, and how did you know it was too high? (like symptoms you felt)
