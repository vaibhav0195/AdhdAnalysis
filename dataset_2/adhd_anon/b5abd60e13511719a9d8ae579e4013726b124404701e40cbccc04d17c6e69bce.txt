I also have severe anxiety, and I take some benzos for it. I started taking some Ritalin shortly after being diagnosed.     - So far, I take 30 to 50mg a day, and it works really well.    - The thing is, I haven't drank a drop of alcohol in about 2 years now, because I was afraid of mixing with the meds. Drinking a beer or two with benzo was fine, I've never had any real side effects. The only thing I noticed is that I was getting drunk faster. I'm not really into being completetely drunk, so it was fine, I learned how to control myself and just drink a bit.   - Now that I'm on Ritalin, I'm curious to know if I can drink alcohol. I'm talking just a bit, like a small glass of wine, or a beer.    -  **TL;DR: I'm on benzo, and I started taking Ritalin, can I have a small glass of wine once in awhile?**   Thank you.   -  **edit/update:** so I tried drinking a very small amount of alcohol (small light beer), far enough from my last dose of ritalin. I didn't felt really drunk, but sleepy instead. Not even happy or joyful (like I used to feel when I drank). It's kind of a good experience though, I was "missing" alcohol for a long time, but now that I know how I react to it, I don't want some anymore. Thank you all for your help!
