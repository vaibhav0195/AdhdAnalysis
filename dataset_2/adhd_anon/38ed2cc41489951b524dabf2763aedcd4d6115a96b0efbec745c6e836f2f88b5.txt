38ed2cc41489951b524dabf2763aedcd4d6115a96b0efbec745c6e836f2f88b5;;;High sensation seeking and ADHDers;;;I have been reading up on different career choices I'd like to make and stumbled upon high sensation seeking personality types. A man named Zuckerman began doing research on those with personality types that get bored fast. He called them high sensation personalities. It seems as though these types seek higher levels of stimulation not because of getting bored faster, that's just a result, but because the brain of them processes information much faster leading to the craving for high stimulation. It has also been theorized that those with adhd also have this quality. So my question is, is this why we are given stimulants, to satisfy the brains need for higher sensations so that we can allow ourselves to focus on a single task? Also does anyone have any advice on a career(s) that provide this?  Source:http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensation_seeking
