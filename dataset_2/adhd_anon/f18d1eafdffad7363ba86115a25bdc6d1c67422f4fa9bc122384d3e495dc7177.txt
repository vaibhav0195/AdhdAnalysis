I have ADHD [22M], and take medication for it. Sometimes when I'm sitting down and trying to do work, I have this sudden urge to satisfy some sort of need or craving to do something. Its rather hard to explain, but to put it simply, it like being horny, or hungry - but none of those things feel like the right answer. Its not violent, and never really makes me frustrated. I'm not sure if this has anything to do with my ADHD, but I feel like it does somehow. Sometimes its intense, and i have to get up and take a walk or something to take my mind off of it, but sometimes its mild and I can easily push it away. Does anyone else experience this? What is it? If so, what have you found that works for you?  TL;DR I have weird cravings to do something and nothing satisfies. I might be a serial killer or maybe Im just hungry.  Edit: I think its a weird urge to do ANYTHING else. It usually happens when im trying to study or do some other boring mundane task. It feels more like a gut craving than a mental disinterest, how do I deal with this?
