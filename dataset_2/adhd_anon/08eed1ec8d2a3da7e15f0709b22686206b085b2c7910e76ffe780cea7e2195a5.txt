I am so fucking excited to tell you **I FINISHED A BOOK**.  I haven't done this in years!!! I enjoy reading again!!!!  The book is [Driven to Distraction](http://www.amazon.com/Driven-Distraction-Revised-Recognizing-Attention/dp/0307743152/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1341864405&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=driven+to+distraction) and it's really helped me understand my ADHD.  I'm buying a copy for my dad so he can better understand me.  I was diagnosed with ADHD four months ago, tried Wellbutrin, didn't work, now on Zoloft + Adderall and it seems to be the perfect combination!!!  However, I still really need help **balancing my school and work life**  It seems like I always pile too much on myself but I like being busy...  Basically: Still have a few papers left to write that are due in a few weeks time Have some exams to study for.  How do I plan that out and prioritize that?  How can I fit this in with work and other personal projects / fun?  Is it ok to accept some amount of failure? Some points I know I can't get back but I still feel too guilty to start on stuff I can get full credit for.  I know it's stupid but some encouragement would be awesome.  **tl;dr Need help balancing school / work life.  How do I prioritize tasks and split up large projects?**
