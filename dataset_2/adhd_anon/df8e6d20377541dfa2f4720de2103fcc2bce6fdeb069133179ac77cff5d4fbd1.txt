df8e6d20377541dfa2f4720de2103fcc2bce6fdeb069133179ac77cff5d4fbd1;;;Dr. just raised my Wellbutrin from 150mg to 300mg, will this help my attentiveness?;;;Ive been on Wellbutrin for about a month and a half and at first saw some differences in my mood and anxiety but my inattentiveness was still present. It has helped with my thought process as far as not thinking of a million things at once. However I still get distracted easily and not as organized as i want to be. Ive even implemented reminders, alarms, and a calendar. I just cant seem to stick with it.  I was prescribed Wellbutrin 300mg today, from what ive read online and heard from people is that wellbutrin works better for depression (which i have a mild case of) but not as well for ADHD.   Seems like my Dr. is started me from the bottom wellbutrin 200mg daily and is gradually raising my dosage. Im hoping 300mg helps or she prescribes a second med on top of wellbutrin.   Will i see a difference taking 300mg and will i experience side affects like i did when i first started wellbutrin?   **EDIT: Title error i meant to say Im on 200mg daily and dosage was raised to 300mg daily**
