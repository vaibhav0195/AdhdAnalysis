e97a776bcac6b2b55305fa3a14c622e17aea508095571ad8dce583fe12710de3;;;I'm new to all of this...;;;I've been looking for a place to ask questions and get advice from people who know how I feel... About a week and a half ago I was diagnosed with ADHD.  I'm in the 1st percentile (meaning 99% of people my age can sit still and concentrate longer than I can, but you probably know that).    First of all, I want to explain myself.  This disorder has been getting progressively worse over the past couple years.  I'm 17 and a junior in High School who is taking mostly honors classes.  Now, me last year would have tackled these classes no problem.  I'd be doing homework every night, and studying for tests for hours, ensuring I do exceptional.  However, this year is not like last year.  I develop cases of the "Fuck-its" where I say I'll do it later.  I'll do it later.  I'll do it later.  And then forget about it.  I also have had some episodes where I will get extremely emotional. This varies from excitement, to depression, to anger.  I'll burst out crying, laughing, or I'll punch the nearest wall or slam on the desk I'm sitting at.     It's a endless nightmare and it's killing me.  I need advice on how to calm down, how to sit and study and how to get shit done.  I want to do a lot of things, but I try to do them all at once and none of them get done.      TL;DR  I want to get shit done and calm down.  How would I approach this? And should I try the medication they give me (Is it worth it)?
