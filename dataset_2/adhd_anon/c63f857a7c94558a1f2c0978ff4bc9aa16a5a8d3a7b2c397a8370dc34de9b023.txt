The diagnosis may have been clinically correct in that I meet the diagnostic criteria, but so far, the belief 'I have ADHD' hasn't [paid much rent](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Making_beliefs_pay_rent) [timesink warning: link directs to LessWrong].  I've tried a lot of drugs in the past year, a really absurd number of drugs, starting with the obvious ones in the stimulant class. Most of these drugs have done nothing, or made matters worse. Some work really well, but only for a short time.  **Stuff that's supposed to help but doesn't**  Low-dose Adderall produces more ADHD-like behaviors rather than less, while high-dose Adderall promotes 'scrubbing the floor with a toothbrush' activities. Ritalin at any dose exacerbates negativity -- I fixate on anything that seems like a 'problem', but in an inflexible deterministic way that precludes action rather than promoting it.  Outside the stimulant class, atomoxetine is pure nihilism in a bottle at any dose, SSRI's make me paradoxically suicidal, and even low-dose modafinil produces violent outbursts of rage.  **Stuff that helps a lot but then suddenly doesn't any more**  The only ADHD med that helped at all with the core ADHD impairments was guanfacine. Guanfacine was a home run. Despite all the side effects, I'd be glad to stay on guanfacine for the rest of my life. Unfortunately, the benefits abruptly crapped out after 4 weeks, are not recovered by any reasonable increase in dosage, and don't return even after several weeks of abstinence from the drug. Combining guanfacine with stimulants is not better than guanfacine alone, tried that a few times.  Outside the ADHD meds, I get a lot of benefits out of caffeine and nicotine. Both of these are much more effective for me than classical stimulants. However, like with the guanfacine, I experience rapid [tachyphylaxis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachyphylaxis). With all of these useful substances. the problem does not appear to be drug tolerance -- the effects don't gradually diminish over time, and discontinuation is not accompanied by a uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms or by a rebound to symptoms above baseline. All damn things just abruptly (overnight) stop working after a few days or weeks, and it takes an indefinitely long period of abstinence before they start working again.  **Baseless speculation**  Having also ventured into more obscure 'cognitive enhancement' supplements (including memantine, which did not 'reset my tolerances' as it's often purported to do) , I've had many experiences where a substance will be helpful only once, after a single administration, and trying it again after any length of time does not recover the original benefits. It's like my brain becomes 'immunized' to any particular helpful stuff.  In some ways, this issue with the medications seems reminiscent of one of the issues with the ADHD itself, in that a subject or activity that I find interesting/stimulating today is dead to me tomorrow, and it takes a long period of disengagement before a given thing can be 'fresh' and engaging once again. It's almost as though I get rapidly 'bored' with the medications the same way I get 'bored' with everything else.  **WHAT DO?**  The obvious solution would be cycling different substances. Guanfacine, nicotine, and caffeine, for instance, theoretically have quite different mechanisms of action. Frustratingly, this hasn't approach hasn't worked either -- after one effective substance craps out, all of the others seem to work poorly for a long time as well. It's sort of like there's one thing they're all hitting indirectly to produce their benefits, and that thing becomes desensitized.  At the risk of turning this into a 'DAE' post, what the hell is going on here and how does anyone else deal with this sort of thing? I venture that I'm a reasonably smart guy, and I've devoted a lot of (scarce!) attention to this, but I'm honestly at my wit's end. I'd be ready to give up on medications altogether, but the briefly-transformative power of some of these substances makes every cognitive and behavioral approach I've tried look like twiddling my damn thumbs by comparison.  **TL;DR: If you made it through all that text, maybe your meds are working better than mine.  Long struggle with ADHD medication has gone poorly, some 'atypical' drugs are spectacularly helpful, but everything that's helpful craps out rapidly. Much frustrate.**
