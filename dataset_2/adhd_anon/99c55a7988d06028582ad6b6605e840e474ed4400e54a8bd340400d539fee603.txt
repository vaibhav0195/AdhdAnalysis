I'm probably one of the most inconsistent persons I've ever known. I can't manage to take my meds consistently for more than a week even though I'm usually at my most motivated, most inspirational, most composed person I've ever been when I'm on them. Essentially, my meds turn me into the person I've always wanted to be.  Yet, despite knowing that person is within my grasp, I can't seem to take my meds...and so I'm left with the self who struggles.  How about you guys?
