8ec4d78d31217c30008bf196ebaf1ddede944941bd7cd950c3643bd2fcb1ed6f;;;Long term ADHD medication use;;;A little background first: I'm a senior majoring in chemistry and was diagnosed with ADHD a little over two years ago. Since then I've been off and on different stimulants and have now settled on vyvanse since it seems to be the most effective drug for me with the least side effects. In the past I've tried regular adderal but had the worse crashes off of it and adderal xr but experienced the same problem. I've been taking 60 mg's of vyvanse about 3-4 times a week since the fall with occasional breaks when I'm not in school.  However, while I love how alert and productive vyvanse makes me I really hate some of the side effects(crashing off of it sucks and it definitely changes my personality and reduces my emotions almost to nothing) and am worried about how effective it will be for long term use since I am already at the maximum recommended dose. So I was hoping to get some feedback from people who have been on ADHD medicine for the long term and what their experience has been like. I had a few specific questions to ask but any input you have would be helpful.  Do you actually take vyvanse/your medicine every day and if so did you expierence problems with it stopping to work and what were your side effects like?  What about your personality? Do you feel like your medicine has had a negative effect on it?  Again these are just a few general questions and I'd be grateful for anything else you have to add. Thanks and have a great day!  **TLDR** Anyone here take ADHD medication every day for a long time and if so what is/was your experience on it?
