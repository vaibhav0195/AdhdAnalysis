aa22d19d34995c646cf3f66637316f9cfdc02b5c30afb261b9bfc9e8c387c0c6;;;Please i need some advices , i'm just starting the last year of medical study and i'm allready freaking out ( tl;dr );;; Hi , i'm a 27 years old french medical student , i'm in the last year of the theorical verse of medical study , ending by a national final wich rank will determine our speciality and town of practical practicing.                                                                                                                My craving for advise mostly focus about  medication , in france adhd treatment and adhd in general are not a big concern and we don't have many different meds nor protocols .                                                                                                          My psychiatrist precribed me ritaline lp ( i don't think LP ring any bell for you anglo-saxons it means delayed delivery / long period of action ) , initially at 60 mg / day ( 6 years ago ) now up to 100 mg /day .  my weight is 107 kilograms , 235,895 in your non metric system .                                                                                                         My question is what dose should i take , how , when ... By not knowing i just totally loose my mind . The only doubt of taking to much bring the fear of insomy issues , and the fear bring insomnia .       Same mecanism with taking not enough , and beeing affraid of not focusing .                                                                                                                                                                                            The saddest thing is  that i have to trust myself on how to read and interpret my symptoms and find the good posology , but i cannot do that , cause i know i'll freak out , i'll feel tired for no Reasons , i'll just stimblow my brain out for nothing but misinterpretetion and anxiety and impulsivity .                                                                                                                     I actually spend my days at the hospitals in the mornings and afternoon studying , i only take pills the afternoon for studying , because a morning without ritalin in this 7/24 studying life is like holliday.      What dose should i take for an afternoon of work .    Thanks for reading this definitly tldr post , and for your advices , i can , did and will look on the internet but the diversity of answers i find and the time spent away from actual study snowball my anxiety. Thanks for your help
