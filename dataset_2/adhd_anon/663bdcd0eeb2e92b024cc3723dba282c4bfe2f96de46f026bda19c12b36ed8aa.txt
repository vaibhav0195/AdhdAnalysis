I was reading a link to ADDitude listing Inattentive ADHD symptoms.  I'm going down the list, check, check, check.  Then it sort of hit me,  I don't remember formally talking to my son about his situation beyond stating he had Inattentive ADHD.  It just sort of evolved over the years.  I was considering sharing the article with him so he knows what we see and why we know he has ADHD.     However, being a young teenager, I can also see him using this as argument ammunition every time he doesn't want to do his chores.      "Dad, you *know* I forget things, so why are you punishing me for playing my video game and not doing the dishes?"             What are the pros and cons of having a dialogue about his condition?  What happened when you did this with your kids?
