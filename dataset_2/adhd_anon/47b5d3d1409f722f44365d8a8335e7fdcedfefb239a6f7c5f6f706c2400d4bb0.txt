Makes me a little unbalanced emotionally.  I have another sample bottle for one more week, thats my last sample then its up to me if i want to use my prescription.  Really not sure what to do, if i dont feel anything within the next week i dont know because it can take a month to work. but what if it really doesn't work for me?

The school wants to put me in the full day ESE class. MY LIFE IS FUCKED. my mom tells me there is no magical pill to help me but i dont know what im gonna do  i dont do a lot of my work because i dont understand any of it, i cant focus, everyone puts me down, the teachers yell at me and tell the class were dumb. Im sick of this life. I didnt choose to be born. i was put here against my will

You cant god damnit! ). I told him i know more than him when it comes to ADHD. I have read russell barkleys books and speeches, yet my parents dont anything about it.  They say oh well you obviously can focus because you read the ADHD books you were interested in. you focus on video games for 12 hours  HOW DO I EXPLAIN ADHD TO SOMEONE WHO IS SO FULL OF STEROTYPES!? for the love of god someone help me, my parents dont understand me the slightest bit, and i dont wanna grow up with us hating each other for the stuff we dont understand

I do not notice the 15mg to much basically. I take it at 6am(Classes start at 7) it wears off at 12, when i still have 2 classes plus stuff i have to do at home. I am considering just switching to instant release adderall because im not sure what else to do. I also want to switch to 10MG IR or 20MG XR, im just not quite sure, i feel the adderall but don't know if its enough
