Reading all your amazing stories gives me hope.  I'm a 23 year old medstudent (f), now in my second of six years of medschool. I almost failed my finals last year, which was the point where I started questioning whether there might be something wrong with me. I got diagnosed with ADHD a few weeks ago and tomorrow will be the day I get my meds. I read all these amazing stories about how it was just as "putting on glasses", but I'm scared that it won't have the same effect for me. My therapist tries to prepare me by describing it as "getting a cane but still limping". I'm just so sick of procrastinating, feeling worthless and like everyone around me is better at literally everything. And I still feel like it's me and not my ADHD causing all this, but I hope it will go away. Will it go away? I need some encouragement...  Tl;dr - I'm afraid my meds won't work as well as some people say they do and I need some encouragement.  Thank you, guys!
