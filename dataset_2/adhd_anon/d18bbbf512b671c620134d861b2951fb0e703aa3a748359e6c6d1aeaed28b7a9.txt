I was started on 10mg Adderall XR every morning for 30 days. A few days ago I met with a new psychiatrist in the town where I go to college, and after a lengthy discussion--that went far beyond just the ADHD--he decided to not up the dosage of Adderall XR. Instead he prescribed the same Adderall XR 10mg, but also Bupropion XL 300mg (mfg: Actavis) saying that it would act as a reuptake inhibitor? I complained about feeling a crash later in the day with the XR, so he said that this would be the ideal course of action opposed to increasing the XR. After reading up on it, I'm worried that this combination of prescriptions could be a risk to my health. So far, I've noticed I do feel a longer and more consistent focus throughout the day along with amplified emotions, however, I also have felt moments of extreme anxiousness. Does anybody have past experience? Thoughts? Knowledge? Thanks.
