I did take it previously a couple times in college (literally two times) I was diagnosed last week and decided to take my adderall yesterday morning. Initially I felt very drowsy and and at unease. I felt tired but then half an hour I was able to focus for a little while and then it would go away. Overall in the day I thought it helped. When I got home my nose was a little runny. I thought it wasn't a big deal. At night it got worse and I couldn't sleep - which was okay with me because I know that's an initial side effect. But then I woke up and I felt sick and it felt like I had a really bad cold. My nose was soooo runny and clogged it wasn't even funny. I took an Allegra and was able to get 4 hours of bad sleep. Is a runny nose and congestion a common side effect or is this going to wear off over time because last light was the worst night I've had in a while. Please let me know what you guys think. I'm going to go to my psych pretty soon and tell him what happened. Also one of eyes looked noticeably smaller than the other which I thought was weird.
