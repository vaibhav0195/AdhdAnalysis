(Huffington Post);;;Read [this](http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/9055288) article yesterday on a friends Facebook wall. It's not specifically geared toward ADHD, but I can still definitely relate on a rather uncomfortable level to the "man" in this scenario.    Me forgetting to do certain small things is an ongoing thorn in my relationship's proverbial side; and this article reminded me of an argument we had one time where my SO wanted me to do something (I can't even remember what it was now) and I blurted out "it's hard because it's just not important to me."   He took it as me saying that his feelings weren't important, whereas I meant that task itself wasn't high on my list of priorities in general and that made it more difficult for me to remember to do.   This article reinforced that moment and made it a little easier to understand from his end. I'd love to hear other peoples thoughts/experiences and any advice on breaking out of this rut in genera.
