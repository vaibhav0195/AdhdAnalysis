It's been such a long ride that I can't believe it's actually happened.       I'm a computer science major, and the thing is, when you initially start out, you have to get through what's called the entry level courses before you can actually be promoted into the major.        I've been stuck in entry level CS for the past two years.  I've been stuck in the data structures class for the longest time.  In fact, I took it 3 times.  The first time?  I had a huge mental breakdown when I took this class, and my performance tanked as a result of it.  I made a C-, but you need a 2.5 major GPA and a C or better to advance.  I didn't get that.        It was the following summer that I had taken my friend's advice on getting checked for ADHD, as he and some other friends of mine had seen symptoms of it in me.        With my medication in hand, I could see a change coming and told myself that this semester would be the one where everything would turn around.  For whatever reason, they let me go into the next level class, computer architecture, and it was *difficult*.  By that I mean, "I wanted to cry because it was so hard" difficult.  My semester quickly turned to shit, ending up with me dropping this class and my calculus class.  I fell under full time and it was horrible.  Even with medication, I still wasn't doing well.  I was losing hope fast.      Seeing the rigor that was computer architecture and my then weak knowledge of data structures, I decided to backtrack in my degree plan and retake it with one of the best instructors here.  While I managed to learn a lot this second go round (this considering I barely remembered anything the first time with a different instructor), I unfortunately made a D.  Bearing in mind that you can only take a given entry level class twice here... I was going into panic mode.  CS is my life and for it to slip out of my fingers like that?  I wasn't going to let it go that easily.      So, the same instructor taught the same class this summer and I figured it'd be a wise decision to take it then, since I was already familiar with his style and what to expect from.  Along with the one month history class I put myself through... I was actually nervous about failing again.  The funny thing is that... you kinda get tired of failure after failure after failure.  I was so sick of settling for less all the time... and my motivation to do as well as I could went through the roof.  And I guess you could say that's when it "clicked."  I saw the true purpose of my medicine and... results began showing.        I definitely worked harder than any other time in my life, and... I *finally* made the B that I needed to get out of entry level.  I still can't believe I'm out of entry level... it's so surreal.  But I actually, legitimately did it.        I just wanted to shout this somewhere, because if I hadn't been diagnosed with ADHD... if I didn't have the medication as a tool to help me make it through... I don't know what the outcome of all of this would've been.  Reading you guys' stories proved to be encouraging throughout of all of this.  And I have to thank you all for that.  I have my motivation back.  My desire to do well is in full force... a desire I haven't felt in *years*.      I'm not completely out of the woods yet, since I have to retake computer architecture -- and it's my last attempt.  But I know I can make it through just fine.  I got this. :]      **TL;DR: Was stuck in CS entry level for 2 years, *finally* made it out thanks to meds and using them to build better work habits.**
