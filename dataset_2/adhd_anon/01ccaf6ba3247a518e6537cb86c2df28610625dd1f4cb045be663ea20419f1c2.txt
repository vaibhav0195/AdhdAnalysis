Literally changed my life. I had few negative symptoms and was able to concentrate for once. I didn't need to constantly tap my leg when studying or get distracted or whatnot. I didn't feel a "crash" or anything after. I take 10mg and that lasts me about 3 - 4 hours which is alright for a study session.  I'm just worried that Ritalin will lose effectiveness, has anyone experienced that? I don't want to get my hopes up too high. Also I didn't experience that 'euphoric' feeling or whatnot. Does that mean I don't have ADHD?
