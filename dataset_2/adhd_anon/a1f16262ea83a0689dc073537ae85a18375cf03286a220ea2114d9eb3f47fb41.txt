And I can't seem to focus on anything because of the anticipation.;;;TL;DR: The anticipation of potentially getting meds in a few days is getting me so excited I can't focus at work. Any tips on patience?  After several months of talking to a psychiatrist, and him confirming that it is very likely I have ADHD-PI, we were looking into medication options. But my blood pressure was too high at a measurement he took! I panicked for a while, thinking I may never be able to get help with this, but I was also pretty sure the blood pressure is due to elevated heart rate from anxiety (which is mostly ADHD induced). I bought a blood pressure monitor, measure it religiously at home morning and evening, and I am actually in the normal range unless I am stressed out or anxious (which happens often during the day, particularly in the presence of people I'm unfamiliar with). So problem solved. I should get my meds in a few days time, when I see my psychiatrist again.  The problem: that's all I can think about (barring a few things I am hyperfocusing on occasionally), and it is really affecting my performance at work. I end up staring in space and zoning out more often than not, which is bad, since I have some deadlines coming, and it's still a fairly new job that I don't want to mess up.   On the one hand, I keep imagining just how awesome it would be to be able to control what I focus on (oh the irony!), wondering what aspects of ADHD it will help with (memory? time perception? emotional regulation? impulsivity?), and fantasising about how much easier some everyday tasks may become. On the other hand, I worry that something else may pop up (psychiatrist still not convinced about blood pressure issues, or some other health issue), or that the meds may not work, or that the starting dose will be too low to help me in any way, or nasty side effects, etc etc.   My focus had been getting a bit better in the past few months, through mindfulness, exercising and a better diet, but it has been feeling worse than ever this past week.  I guess I mainly needed to rant to someone who would understand what this feels like. But any advice or tips are also welcomed!

I was thinking of getting one that specialises in ADHD (since I've been diagnosed with that by a psychiatrist), but lately I've been reading about BPD (borderline personality disorder) as well, and I relate to what people are saying about it quite a bit (unlike a lot of other disorders I've been reading about). **I am trying to determine which kind of therapist to go to first** (I will switch of course if it doesn't work out).  I guess my question is how common are the following among other people with ADHD:  * **no real sense of identity**. I often feel like there are 3 different people living inside me, each pulling in different directions. Some days I feel like I want to focus entirely on building my career, other days I just want to go out partying in a self-destructive binge, and in yet other days I just want to be entirely altruistic and focus on helping other people. I don't feel like I belong anywhere, and whatever I start doing, I want to be doing something else  * **black and white thinking**. I often become "infatuated" with a person, to the point where they are perfect and I see no flaw in them. I want to dedicate my whole life to make them happy, since they are the most amazing person ever. It gets to the point of obsession. Then they do something to disappoint me, or reject me because I become too needy and clingy, making it obvious they aren't as perfect as I imagined, and my whole life feels shattered. I tend to withdraw in self-loathing rather than lashing out at them though (unlike many BPD people).  * **intense emotional outbursts**. The way it works for me is that if something bad happens, it's as if my brain can only focus on memories of other bad things happening, forgetting any good things I may have going for me. The initial slight negative emotion spirals down uncontrollably until I start having suicidal thoughts and self-destructive behaviour. The opposite is also true for happy feelings, making my life feel like quite the rollercoaster. It is different than bipolar, since it isn't a cycle, and is always triggered by something real. It's just that I can't regulate my emotions and just say "stop it, it isn't so bad, it will pass"  **How often do you experience something like that?**. General tips on how to choose a therapist also welcomed.
