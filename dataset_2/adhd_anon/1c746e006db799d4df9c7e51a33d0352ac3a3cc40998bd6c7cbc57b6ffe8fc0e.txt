1c746e006db799d4df9c7e51a33d0352ac3a3cc40998bd6c7cbc57b6ffe8fc0e;;;I find myself struggling with reading on Vyvanse: Is it normal?;;;I've been taking it for a couple of weeks now. The first day it seemed to be working as intended; increased attention (slightly), and it felt a little easier to get things done etc.   Few days later: I noticed i had a harder time reading. It was jumpy and choppy. Harder to comprehend what i was reading, and got stuck on--not to complicated words quite often. At times finishing a sentence; confused with what i had read; to realize i had put one word in-front of another, or simply misread. This is something i normally don't struggle with.  However: Its been a couple of weeks now, and it's still persistent. I tried taking a few days of (4); it didn't help. I can also find my self zoning out easier, you know when you literally lose focus; like a camera, and get left glaring into, whatever is in-front of you. Anyone recognize this?  Got in contact with my psychiatrist; got her assistant. She said it could be a problem with my vision, something i had already ruled out: Seeing my psychiatrist in a week roughly.  TL;DR: Hard time reading on Vyvanse; get words mixed up, or put them in the wrong order - it's choppy.
