I was diagnosed last month after having a really rough month to the semester. I'm 19, in my sophomore year of college, but my mom always suspected I've had ADHD. After the interview the doc said "well I haven't gone through the numbers yet, but I can tell you have a lot of ADHD." I ended up maxing out all the scales.  So I went to my psych Monday, she (very reluctantly) gave me a prescription for 10mg Adderall twice daily. I took the first pill yesterday, and within half an hour, I felt like a new person. I was able to read an entire article without skipping around to different paragraphs, I sat through all of Civil War without wanting to get up or look at my phone, and I could talk to my friend and stay engaged in the conversation.  I feel great. I realize it's only day two and I'll probably have to make some adjustments up the road, but I'm just so happy that I know I can feel like this.
