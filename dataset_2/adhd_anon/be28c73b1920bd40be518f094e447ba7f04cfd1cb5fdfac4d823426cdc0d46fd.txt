LMHC;;;TL;DR - Deciding between what type of therapist I should see: clinical psychologist, Licensed Mental Health Counselor, or other. Please provide your thoughts and experiences, as well as what types of therapy (DBT, CBT, etc.) you've done and how they've worked for you. Thanks =3  ---  Hey, I was just looking to get people's opinions and experiences with clinical psychologists vs. Licensed Mental Health Counselors. I currently see a psychiatrist who I've been seeing for 3+ years who has diagnosed me with ADHD but feel like he's never been really that helpful beyond giving me access to medication. I definitely have wanted to address issues regarding my impulsive decision making, failure to learn from experience, and sensation seeking behaviors and so I decided to seek out someone who does psychotherapy, specifically someone trained in DBT (which focuses on emotional regulation skills and mindfulness) because I did some of it through a friends and family group I participated in while dating a girl (now ex) with BPD. I found it really useful and want to continue it, along with pursuing other things that would help me better cope with my ADHD, such as getting help developing my habits around school and homework and figuring out how I best learn. Anyways, would love to hear people's thoughts on what type of therapist they recommend or what types of therapies have worked for them. Feel free to ask me any questions.
