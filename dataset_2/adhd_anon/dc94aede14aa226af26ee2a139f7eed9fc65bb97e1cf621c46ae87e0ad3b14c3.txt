I'm naturally a anxious guy, this can be confirmed with my OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) syndrome (now in controll) and maybe my social anxiety.    My point here is, how others psychologicals ill's can affect directly our ADHD? look, the fact i have social anxiety make me be always over thynking, to the point my mind get tired. So i was before a normal guy,  my parents had said to me a couple of times i had ADHD, but i never belive it, since i never had problens with it. But now this is a REAL problem to me, this get worse and started to prejudice me and i perceived that this came after my over thynking experience and OCD experience.  I thynk my mind is tired and maybe it boosted my weak and no problematic ADHD to a powerful one.   Can someone explain better what is going on with my head? Thanks everyone! i apreciate every help :)
