734274f248bdff100defd4886487cf5d1b8e08096157af95d8b1b5ed64f645ae;;;Occupations...;;;My son was diagnosed with ADHD last summer. He's six and seems to be all over the place sometimes. He likes school but has a tough time focusing on his home studies. So my question, if I may be so bold, is to ask what are some of your occupations? I worry about him sometimes. I just want to know that his ADHD wont inhibit him from being successful. Thank you in advance.  Edit: thank you very much for your responses. This community has made me feel much better about how my sons future will shape up. I will stay patent with him and continue to lurk in here to get a better under standing of this. I do believe ADHD is genetic. My father was diagnosed at 45 and my brother in law has always taken meds for it since he as about my sons age. It's really the anger that worries me. I want to find an outlet for him (besides video games. He gets so pissed at them). Just not sure what yet. Thank you again.
