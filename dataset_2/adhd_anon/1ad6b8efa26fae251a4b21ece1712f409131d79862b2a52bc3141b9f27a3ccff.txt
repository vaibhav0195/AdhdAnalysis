He also has Aspergers. It has been a big change for us to adjust to the diagnosis (though my husband and I have suspected for awhile), but we've been busy plowing through a lot of reading material to ensure that he has the support and help he needs. We are also in the process of getting him on medication.  He will be going to a new school this year, and I'd love some advice on how to best help him adjust.   As a family, we discussed what might help him, and though he says it'll be annoying, he thinks an after-school schedule would be beneficial. I agree, after doing so much reading that says schedules and routine are helpful. I have a few questions on how to approach a schedule though.  1.) When he sits down to do homework at a specific time, how much involvement should I have in making sure everything gets done? I don't want to hover or nag, but I know he gets distracted easily.   2.) Should his homework/study time be broken up (i.e. study, then break, then study, etc.) or should there just be a block of time to do it?  3.) Is there anything else I can suggest to him that might help him study/do homework? I've heard listening to gentle music can help.   Thank you so much! Any other advice would be greatly appreciated, as this is still very new to us all.
