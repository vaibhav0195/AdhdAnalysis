24d17a6c90a2ba52b11760c29bd10c34d610c4cfbdc2415dbc3f4fb46f84cfb9;;;Any short to the point adhd podcast recs? Eric Tivers unfortunately doesn't work for me;;;I've heard such amazing things, but the intros are too long for me. I don't want to take a seminar, I don't want to listen to people who have.   I finally figured out how much space to skip to start the podcast, bu by then, with the waiting for it to load, making sure I skipped enough but not too much.... i get too excited about the topic and it takes too long to get into it so i go on to the next video to see if it's quicker... then on to the next... the next... the next. Before I knew it I had clicked on what seemed like 50 episodes.  So then I googled adhd in the search and found tonnns of podcasts, most weren't my thing, the person talking has to have adhd, i can't take advice from people who don't. Is that weird? Anyway, i found one, she was great, but i lost it when I parked to get gas. Never found it again :-(   I typically love podcasts, but they have to grab my attention right away or I'm over it. And none of that teasing thing then onto sponsors webinars, etc etc etc.   His topics sound awesome though, he should have a tldr version for every podcast. Anyone know something similar? Oh, also need a soothing voice, loud noises freak me out lol :-/
