755b5ea13447d4a8435ed55d1bce34f8264952fa5e7ba6758a26c77fc557db82;;;3 yrs since first diagnosis and treatment...going back to square 1 to ease my family's speculation;;;Hey guys....so I've been through straterra, vyvanse, adderall xr, vyanse, adderall IR + XR, and, most recently Adderall XR 2x's daily. After recently taking more than prescribed on many occassions (1 extra b/c was either not "feeling" the effects, or was just in a poor enough mood resulting in not noticing its effects), and being left at the end of the month with 10 days without pills, thus increased amounts sleeping and getting little-to-no work done at work...I've decided to ask my doctor--based on my family's suspicions, opposite my own--if we were right with the diagnosis in the first place.  So...I've been given a name and number to call tomorrow to setup an appointment with a doctor who will administer a 2 hour computerized assessment to see if my issues are ADHD related and/or if there are other problems therein.  **If I see an interest** in a follow-up on the details, assessment, results, med change, etc...**then there will be more on the story as it develops.**  Stay tuned...**and feel free to ask questions in the mean time!**  *Also*...I've made the switch back to Vyvanse 70mg, *once-a-day* again, just until we get the test results.  **FINAL EDIT: I finally scheduled my appointment tomorrow, at 1pm. I'll follow-up after testing is through, or as questions are posted.**  **Ok...I guess *this* will be the final edit until I get my results. THE TEST: *see "My psych eval" comment* below.**
