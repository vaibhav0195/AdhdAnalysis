Basically in the last 5 years or so there has been a growing awareness of some attention deficits and just random, crazy weird things that either I have noticed or someone close to me has noticed.   The one that started it all was nearly ten years ago when my then girlfriend noticed I had neatly folded a shirt and put it under the toaster in the kitchen cupboard...  Fast forward a decade, we married, she squeezed out a kid, we are divorcing. A lot happened obviously, but it all ended up with me deciding to pursue diagnosis for adult ADHD. I have never been a good listener, and that has been the most damaging thing in my life to date. It has ruined relationships, caused stressors, etc. I know a lot of ya'll can relate.  I met with my primary physician, he told me I was clearly diagnosable but he wanted a psychiatrist MD to do it. I met with the shrink, got the diagnosis and was immediately prescribed Ritalin. A very low dose, 10mg q daily.  I just took my first dose, and while I feel like I am noticing some significant changes, it is too early to tell how much is psychosomatic and how much is legitimate. So my question to ya'll is...  How have meds helped or hindered? What kind of challenges have you faced with your ADHD and how did you handle them? Will the appropriate use of medication help with my listening skills and interactions in relationships? I'm tired of causing damage and losing friends. I'm naturally an extrovert and have been so lonely for the majority of my life. I wish I had pursued diagnosis earlier.  TL;DR Newly diagnosed ADHD when it should have happened 25 years ago, new to meds (low dose Ritalin), lonely AF cause my lack of listening skills ruin most relationships, help?
