Should I try get a proper diagnosis or try deal with it myself.;;;**Tl;dr** - Was told I'm dyslexic and possibly have ADD. But was told getting a diagnoses might not be worth it because there's not much a psychologist can do to help. I also have ten repeat exams in 20 days. Do you think i should get diagnosed, is it expensive.  **I've always had these issues:**  * **Inability to pay attention** no matter how hard i tried.  * **Terrible concentration** and inability to stick to a task.  * An over active or **restless brain** that just won't stop.(Sorry if this one dosen't make much sense I find it hard to explain)  * An **inability to sit still** and relax.  * Always had the ability to do well, but could never focus or hand stuff in on time.  * Lose phones, keys and id's all the time.   * Constantly late for things. e.g miss bus or have to sprint to bus stop every morning.  * This list goes on, there so much more but i dont know which ones are related to ADD.   **So this is what i did:**  * Went to my GP for help and he refereed me to an educational psychologist because he said i was probably dyslexic.  * Did my assessment, **told I was dyslexic and possibly have ADD**.  * She said she **wasn't qualified to give me the diagnoses**. but she has helped people with learning difficulties before and said she could notice how difficult i was finding it to listen to her without getting distracted. She said i was constantly annoying her by drumming on the table and constantly moving and stretching.  * But she told me getting a diagnoses **might not be worth it** because there's **not much a psychologist can do to help**.  * But now i'm reconsidering it because I have **10 repeats in 20 days** and want all the help I can get.  * Plus i feel like ADD would be so relieving to be diagnosed with becuase **it would explain soooooooo much.**
