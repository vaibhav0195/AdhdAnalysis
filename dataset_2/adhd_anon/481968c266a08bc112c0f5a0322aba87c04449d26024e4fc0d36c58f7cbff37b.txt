But honestly the past two sessions I've gone I have no clue what the hell is going on. I keep losing track of the questions I am asked and it's getting increasingly difficult to express myself. I keep contradicting myself when I talk to the therapist. Also, I totally forgot what was discussed at my last therapy session. All I remember is she told me to try and plan out a day with a schedule, but I haven't gotten around to it.
