Seriously getting frustrated and ready to give up.;;;So I got diagnosed last year. My usual gpa per quarter went from a 2.8-3.5+ . My parents were extremely impressed and said that it has to be the meds working. However, I still feel nothing, after trying 4 different kinds (First aderall, then vyvanse, then ritalin, now concerta).   My doctor even put me on 60mg of vyvanse and I felt nothing....  What are some tricks or tests to see if my meds are working? In class I literally just blank out still and learn nothing. It is becoming a huge issue, and I feel like I will not survive college at all once it begins. I am in desperate help.   Obviously you guys will just comment "Talk to your parents or doctors" , but I want to come here first. Thanks guys
