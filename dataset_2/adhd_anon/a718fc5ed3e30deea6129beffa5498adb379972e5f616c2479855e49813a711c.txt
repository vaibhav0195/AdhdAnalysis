I'm really excited but kind of nervous.;;;Biggest reason why I want to switch:  I'm sick and tired of "having two minds."  I take my concerta in the morning and i do awesome, but after 6 hours I'm a useless piece of shit.  I feel so different on and off medicine and I really just want it to be a constant thing in my life.  I can't develop any positive organizational habits because I forget all about them/don't do them the minute i'm off my medicine.    Also, this whole no stimulants things makes me tired as shit.  I laid on the ground after work today and I fell asleep while my wife and I were mid conversation.  But i'm pushing through.  Let's do this!
