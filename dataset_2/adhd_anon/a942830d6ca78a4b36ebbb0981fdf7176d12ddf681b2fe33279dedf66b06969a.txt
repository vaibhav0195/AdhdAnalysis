Went to the doctors about 7 months ago to discuss the usual anxiety/depression and he referred me for assessment to look at ADHD. Seen 2 people so far and now have an appointment with a speech and language therapist next. Just seems like appointment after appointment with no resolution. Next appointment is a few weeks away and it's playing on my mind a lot. Just looking to vent a bit really. No light at the end of the tunnel right now and still struggling to do all the things the majority of others take for granted. Anyone else have a similar experience trying to get a diagnosis?
