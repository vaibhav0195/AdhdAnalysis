Wanted to say thanks.;;;Almost two years ago, I was browsing /r/bestof, and someone had linked a post from this subreddit. Something along the lines of "What it's like to live with ADHD." I read through it and thought, "Wait a second. It isn't normal to feel this way?"  I started browsing /r/adhd a lot, and the deeper I dug, the more I realized there was probably something wrong with me. I was teaching in Korea at the time, so I didn't really have much access to psychiatric help, but I started a running list of symptoms I noticed. It turned into a full two pages of ramblings of my day-to-day struggles. I moved back to the states about 5 months ago, and I just started a job with full benefits, which opened the door for me to finally get checked out.  This morning I spoke with the psychiatrist for the first time, and he's pretty convinced I have ADHD-PI. He instructed me to taper off the massive amounts of coffee I drink, and come back to see him in 30 days, at which point we will discuss medication. Speaking of medication, he's letting me choose my own after listening to his description/opinion of each. Is that normal?  Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you to everyone here who has shared stories, information, encouragement, and all around good vibes.
