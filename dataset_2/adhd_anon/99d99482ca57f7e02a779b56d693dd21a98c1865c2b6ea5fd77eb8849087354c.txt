I was on medication when I was younger but was taken off rather quickly. I was always an A student, I would just get bored and cause problems.   In college I finally got back on medication when I realized that I could not drink 15+ cups of coffee everyday. I was put on 30mg vyvanse, and for the first time I was able to sit down and plan stuff out. I no longer lost time without knowing where it went. I take it as needed as I usually love my hyper and creative self.   Some years later I am about to graduate and have a job lined up. I recently switched to generic aderall ( cost was too much, and the vyvanse crashes are terrible). I am finding it very hard to finish the most basic of assignments or outside work.    I feel the focus of the medication but I seem to have some motivation issues with getting "easy" work done. I have always been on the impulsive side so motivation was never an issue.  This feels more difficult than before I was medicated. Any advice?
