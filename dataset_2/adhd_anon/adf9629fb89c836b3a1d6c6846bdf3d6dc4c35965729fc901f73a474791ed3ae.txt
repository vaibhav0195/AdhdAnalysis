What can I do to be less impulsive?;;;I'm not good at a lot of things, but I am really, *really* good at making friends. I've moved a lot. But I'm only good at the making part. Anybody close to me comes to be sick of me pretty soon after. It's either because I get too comfortable around them and start acting obnoxious, or I get really angry at them and decide to shut them out of my life forever, only to make up with them the next day. Severe mood swings etc.  I've always been incredibly impulsive throughout life and recently got diagnosed with ADHD. Will medication improve my impulsiveness? What do you do to help remember to chill the fuck out? I thought maybe I was a helpless asshole but I'm starting to feel like I might be salvageable.
