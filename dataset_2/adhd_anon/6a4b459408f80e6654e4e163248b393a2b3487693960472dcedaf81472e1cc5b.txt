If you have any suggestions for that content, or any other improvements you'd like to see in /r/ADHD, reply to this post!**  **EDIT: update as of saturday oct. 1st: have the FAQ about half-written, just been busy with schoolwork, etc.**  Hey all,  Since the previous mods of /r/ADHD had been inactive for a year, I submitted a request to take it over, and I've been approved!   The reason I wanted to do this is mainly because I felt the main page isn't living up to its potential. I want to compile a lot of useful information to link in the sidebar, so that all the "I think I might have ADHD" posters have a list of high-quality information to start with. I'd like to see this subreddit be both a supportive community and a hub of reliable information.   My approach to ADHD is one that's fairly scientific and pro-medication. I haven't yet mentally ironed out what my policies will be, but right now I think it will be like this: I may control what links go in the sidebar, but I don't downvote people with whom I disagree. (I might speak out against your ideas in a public reply, though!) As moderator, I have no plans on tampering with anyone's posts or comments, unless you're spreading misinformation to a dangerous degree, or otherwise being a dick. Standard reddit code of conduct will apply, and I'm sure I don't have to explain that.  A note about merging with /r/ADD, because I know people will be asking: my answer is, I don't know how or if that works, but I'll talk to /r/ADD's mods and we'll see what we can find out. I'll update you when I have more to report.  I'm reasonably busy, and this is also my first time moderating on reddit, so I'll have to ask you to bear with me, especially at first, while I get the hang of things and roll out my planned improvements for this subreddit as I'm able.  Having said all that, feel free to start commenting on this post with ideas for what you think should go into our FAQ, list of helpful links, books, etc.! And if you don't mind, upvote this so more people see it!  Thanks everyone.

Take your semester one week at a time and kick it off with a solid plan! It's /r/ADHD's Kickstart Sunday!;;;#### Needless to say, everyone is invited to participate in Kickstart Sunday every week, student or not.  **/r/ADHD it's time for [Kick-Start Sunday] -- guaranteed accomplishments if you actively participate!**  Kick-Start Sunday is where [/r/adhd](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/) shares the goals, tasks, or habits we want to accomplish this week.  You will be held gently accountable (which is a good thing!) and we can check in with you...helping YOU get things done.  *I suggest you read the whole post to be MORE successful, so put in the little extra initial effort and continue reading....*  *** ## Choose the participation method that works for you: * **Most important task** - Share one (or a couple) **HIGH-PRIORITY** tasks that you really would like to finally finish.  *(Ex. Set a doctors appointment, finish assignment, clean the kitchen...whatever YOU think is most important.)* * **Make a list** - Post a list of all the things you want to accomplish this week.  *(I highly recommend identifying the top 3 priorities.)* * **Feed your soul** - Sometimes by relaxing and having fun we have more energy to get more done. **List a couple FUN items to make your list more exciting.**  **Need/Want to copy last week's list *verbatim*?  Absolutely DO SO!**  *Those might be your keystone habits. Once you start doing those regularly you are able to do more. soon they will be automatic and you can put your focus elsewhere.*  *** By sharing our goal(s) with this understanding community, we can keep each other **accountable**...and **celebrate our successes**, large or small!  **Don’t forget to return for [Win Wedenesday] to flaunt your successes!**  ;-)  By getting one small task done it creates **momentum**, **trust** in yourself, **confidence**, and you will feel like doing more.  *** ## Suggested Guidelines * **Prioritize your list.** One thing you want to get done (or start). What is the most important thing for you? (If making a list works best for you feel free to do that too!) * **Add a finish OR start deadline.** By committing to a date/time, we can check on your progress. * **Edit your comment when done.** - Come back and edit your comment when you have finished your goal. We can celebrate that (and then people won't check on you). * **Small start.** - Share what SMALL (under 10 minutes) commitment you can make towards your goal.  *I found when my clients didn’t reach their goals 90% of the time they never started...this will help you break through the initial barrier.*  *** ## Tips * Your tasks/goals should ideally be S.M.A.R.T goals: **Specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound** * **Measurable** - Make sure you can be able to say YES I DID THIS. **Study enough** is not measurable.  Study 2 hours is. * **Break it down** - Instead of saying clean my room...it might help to say, “Clean room for 10 minutes or pick up trash in room.” * **Write it down elsewhere** - Sticky note by computer.  Google calendar.  Agenda.  Write it down so you don't forget.  Our working memories are flaky.... * **Start small...build up slowly** - We want to build on small successes so committing to cleaning your entire house might be a bit too much to handle.  Pick a room (or a task like ‘pick up dirty laundry’)  instead. * **Want to study for 2 hours a day?** *Commit to studying 30 minutes to make it easier on you.*  *** ## Examples from previous weeks: * Wash clothes. * Finish my math class early.  **Done!** * Eat! * Run 2k. * Don’t burn down my neighborhood.  (In re: fireworks, I hope.)  ;) * Apply for ONE job. * Send rent. * Remember passport, ticket, etc. for trip. * **Start** *[something]*. “Spend 5 minutes on writing my paper.” * List unneeded items for sale on eBay, CL, etc. * Floss * Clean my room to see the floor.  *** ## *It’s now easier to respond!  Just copy/paste the below into your comment.*  	## Daily Habit / Procrastinated Project / Soul-Feeding 	* **What?** - 	* **How much time?** - 	* **When?** - 	* **Potential Obstacles?** - 	* **Check in on me? When?** - 	* **Small Start** - 	* **Reward** - 	* **Something fun you want to do this week** - 	* **Daily Habit** -  *** Daily list template, if that suits you better.  	## Monday --   	* Item 	## Tuesday -- 	## Wednesday -- 	## Thursday -- 	## Friday -- 	## Saturday --   	## Sunday --  *** Don’t forget to **brag about your accomplishments in Win Wednesday** on Wednesday.  **Celebrating/acknowledging your wins is just as important as actually getting stuff done.**  *** **TL,DR: Share what you want to accomplish this week and how you will do it. Having people check on you via Reddit is extremely helpful!**
