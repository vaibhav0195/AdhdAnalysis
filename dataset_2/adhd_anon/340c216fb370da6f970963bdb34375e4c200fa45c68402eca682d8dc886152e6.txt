She told me that I probably have ADHD combined with anxiety and she referred me to a specialist and said to wait about 3 weeks until i'd get a call from them. However, I received a letter in the mail 2 weeks later saying the wait list is 9-12 months for new patients! I also just found out that my dad has diagnosed ADHD. I can't wait another year because I'd almost be done highschool by then and I need the treatment mostly for school! What do I do?? Because I can't wait another year!
