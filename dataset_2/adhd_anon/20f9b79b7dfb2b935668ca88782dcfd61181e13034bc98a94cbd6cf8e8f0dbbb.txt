I have a strict set of values that I hold dear to my heart. I am a deep "feeler".  I have met many guys.  I was intrigued by this one guy. I ruined it because I liked him a lot and felt I had no chance and ran and asked questions that were to personal to early on. but I have never met anyone that i have found so intriguing before
