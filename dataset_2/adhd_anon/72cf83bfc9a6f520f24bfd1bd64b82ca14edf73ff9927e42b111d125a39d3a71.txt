72cf83bfc9a6f520f24bfd1bd64b82ca14edf73ff9927e42b111d125a39d3a71;;;30 year old male recently diagnosed with ADHD, any other people diagnosed later in life?;;;Hello, so my wife has been encouraging me to get some screening done for years now, she says she's concerned and with recent events at work she insisted even more than usual, she has the tools and knowledge as she's a psychiatric nurse at our local hospital so it's her job to diagnose these things. Well low and behold turns out I have ADHD as well as anxiety as well. Was kinda hard to take at the beginning but as I thought about it it explained a lot growing up till now, it's a relief to know that I have a disorder and that I can learn to cope with it. My wife encouraged me to read up on it, as an avid redditor this was the first place I looked, good to know there is a community online that's easily accessible. That's all I can bear to write at the moment thanks for reading if you got this far, you are to be congratulated!
