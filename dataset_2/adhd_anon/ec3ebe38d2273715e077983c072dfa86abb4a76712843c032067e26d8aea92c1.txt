A doctor had the sense to send me to a psychiatrist who performed several tedious tests.   I filled out the questionairs, I took some IQ tests, I sat in front of a computer for 20 minutes and pushed a button every time I heard or saw the #1 and poof!   I have Adult ADHD.   Which makes sense I guess because my mom was told by several teachers when I was a kid that they thought it was ADD but since it was the 90's my mom didn't believe in ADD and ignored them, and enrolled me in dance class, and told me that I was smarter than how i was acting and to smarten the fuck up and pay attention..ha ha ha   Also my dad's parents were told he had an issue, I don't think they called it ADD but did tell them to go on pills to deal with his inattentiveness and rambunctiousness . Since it was the 70's his parents really didn't believe there was an issue and bought him some drums instead.  good times.   Anyway, here I am diagnosed and on a prescription of 30 mg of Vyvanse per day.  Only issue: EATING! Some of you have probably been on vyvanse.  Here is what happens: I am hungry 25/7, like tummy rumbling ravenous, hungry to the point of feeling like I am gong to throw up.   However, despite my body ques that I am super hungry, I can't bring myself to eat anything...at all and not like ones of those    "*OMG guys I can't eat all the pizza I used to I can only eat two slices instead of five! #sohungry*"  It has been a day since I've eaten anything at all and this week since Monday I can tell you I've eaten 2 pieces of toast 2 eggs and one granola bar. Since Monday... and it is now Thursday that is **all** I have eaten.   I know I am so hungry but when I look at food my mind goes...*meh no thanks maybe later. *  Now I am **not** a small girl. I was 240 lbs, 6 months ago, did a keto diet went down to 180 lbs, so I certainly have the extra fat on me that I am not in danger of wasting away for a while.   I have also been taking  a plethora of vitamins because they are supposed to help with the ADHD and keep me from having this dreaded "crash" I keep reading about on Vyvanse.  I sleep fine. I don't get tired irritable or dizzy like I normally would if i skip a meal. I have energy and productiveness, and  feel great. My blood pressure is fine.   Essentiall,y my body doesn't seem to be giving a shit that I don't want to eat anything. I know this isn't healthy and eventually it will become a real issue. I've dropped 6 lbs this week.  Anyone who has experienced this, any tricks on getting yourself to eat something? when I do eat food, I have to resist the urge to spit it out because it is making me feel nauseated. GIVE ME YOUR TIPS AND TRICKS!!!   **TL;DR holy crap sooo many words!sorry!! How do you make yourself eat on vyvanse? also apparently medicated me talks like a 15 year old girl...I apologize.**
