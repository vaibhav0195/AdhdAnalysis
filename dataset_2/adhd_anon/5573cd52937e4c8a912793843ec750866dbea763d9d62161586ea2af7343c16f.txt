Looking to get one.;;;Hey, I was diagnosed with ADD several years ago, one of the many counselors I spoke to over the years HIGHLY recommended I get a wrist watch. He said it was almost essential to make sure I can keep track of what I'm doing, to make sure I stay on task, etc.  Anyone ever do that? I never got one. But I think I will now. I figure these days there's gotta be something cool.   I'm hoping maybe there's one we can put a calendar on it, sync it with our cell phones, maybe it'll vibrate to get your attention, etc.
