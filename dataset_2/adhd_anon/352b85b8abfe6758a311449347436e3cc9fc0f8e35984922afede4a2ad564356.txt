This week they gave me Ritalin and it makes already a big difference. More clear space in my head, better structured thinking and a bit more active. A lot of little things don't take much effort as before.   I have some small side effects, I eat less and yesterday i got some cold hands. But nothing too serious. What are your experiences in the first week of using ritalin?
