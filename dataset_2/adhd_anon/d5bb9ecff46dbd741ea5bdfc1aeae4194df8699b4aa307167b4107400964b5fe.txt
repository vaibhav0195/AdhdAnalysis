d5bb9ecff46dbd741ea5bdfc1aeae4194df8699b4aa307167b4107400964b5fe;;;Way to ask to try a different medication?;;;I been on Adderal XR and vyvanse, while they do work great they have their dislikes.  Adderall XR gave me to much PNS side effects and felt like i was on something.  The Vyvanse was great until it gave me hive like rashes. I liked the smooth "not on something" feeling. Coverage did not last no 12 hours, 5-6 hours top at 70mg  I read about Dexedrine Spansules and would like to try it. To me it sounds like Vyvanse with no amino acid in a Adderall XR Release style. Or a Levo-amphetamine removed Adderall XR  I brought it up before to Doctor and the convo was immediately switch to vyvanse. I ask wise /r/ADHD what would be a professional way to try asking when i go back to have rash checked?  Also i finished reading Healing ADD by Daniel G. Amen, and was wondering. dose anyone else get "locked" into negative thoughts?
