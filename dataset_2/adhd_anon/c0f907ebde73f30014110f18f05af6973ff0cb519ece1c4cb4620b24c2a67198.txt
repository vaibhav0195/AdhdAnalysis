I have had counslors, taken classes for organzation, studyind and have had numerous tutors over the years and nothing has seemed to help. I found the number of a local psychiatrist, but I dont know if she specializes in ADD, will she still be able to diagnosis? and when I call the office what should say to the receptionist when making the appointment? Thank you for any and all advice
