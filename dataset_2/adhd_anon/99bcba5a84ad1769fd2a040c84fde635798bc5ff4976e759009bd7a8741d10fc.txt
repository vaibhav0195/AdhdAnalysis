So I've been on Ritalin, Concerta, and I'm currently on Vyvanse as of January 2016. I find that the effects aren't as strong now compared to last year even though I'm on the same dosage.   I've searched about that and have read that people have felt they've build up a tolerance as well. I didn't feel that way with Concerta, my only problems with that medication was the severity of the side effects.   Any input would be nice, thank you!
