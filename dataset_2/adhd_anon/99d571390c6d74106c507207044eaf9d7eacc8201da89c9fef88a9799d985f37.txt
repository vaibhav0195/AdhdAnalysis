For the most part I've been doing really well with it. Although, recently I noticed one of my symptoms has persisted. I can never finish books or projects. I always end up stopping midway in favor of another book or project. I think I'm currently in the middle of 5 or 6 books. Some of them have as little as 20 pages left. Yet I can't seem to bring myself to finish them. Any advice?
