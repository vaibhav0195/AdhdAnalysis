How ADHD fuels the anxiety and depression that cockblock my improvement.;;;A little background.  I am 28, diagnosed with ADHD 5 years ago and take a very proactive / self aware approach to my ADHD.  I work as a marking director in a mental health clinic so I am surrounded by support and information.   Depression / anxiety have generally been the presenting issues of my ADHD (as my job/life is ADHD appropriate).    I have been doing REALLY WELL lately when it comes to managing my ADHD.  I have kept a clean enough apartment that I can invite people over.  I am getting my work done, and remembering bills (for the most part).   The issue is that everytime I start to get to this point, the amount of energy it takes to stay at this level eventually eats away at me!      This weekend I met my girlfriends sister/brother in law.  This was a stressful event and I did my best to keep my ADHD in check.  I was good in conversation, didn't talk in to many tangents, and none of them would have suspected I have ADHD.  After being home for 1 day I am crashing!   I can't get ANYTHING done, i am depressed, beating myself up, and worried about every aspect of my life!  This is not the first time this has happened, and the fact that it keeps working out this way just makes the whole thing worse!     Does anyone else ever have this problem?   **TL;DR - After a weekend (and week before) of doing SO WELL with my adhd management I am crashing today beyond belief.**

Not stimulant abuse, but depressants and opiates.;;;I am interested to see what others have noticed.   I am diagnosed ADHD, stabilized on stimulant medication for 4 years now.  In discussions with my psychologist (who is amazing) I have realized that I am using beer as a way to medicate my non stop brain.    When I get home and want to wind down, beer is what tends to do it.  She says that this is common, so I wonder what you guys have to say.  I have tried other "drugs" such as coke, opiates, and E,  none of them interested me beyond the actual use "That was fun, not for me".     Do you guys find yourself drawn to self medication and abuse of booze or non stimulants?   Is it a problem for you? Do you find ways to curb it?
