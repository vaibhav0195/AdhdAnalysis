Whenever I talk to people about it, its almost always talked about like its not a real serious problem, or its not a real thing at all. Almost like a term for someone to use if they think someone is stupid, or not paying attention.   I feel like this may be attributed to how add/adhd is/was over diagnosed. or maybe the term itself has been so overused.   even on reddit, ive seen topics in other threads where add/adhd is just treated like some unreal thing, an excuse. idk any one else get this?  edit: not trying to say people should feel more sorry for people with adhd. but for example, if someone notices something different in my work habits, and i attribute it to my add, it usually seems like not a good enough answer for most people.
