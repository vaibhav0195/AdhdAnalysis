My GP suggested I bring along some school reports, I guess to give insight into my grades/how I behaved in the classroom. I just pulled out all my old reports, and after reading them, I am freaking out.  When I was very young, I absolutely adored school. I put in 100% in everything I did, I got good grades, teachers loved me and was always "a delight to have in their class." This was pretty consistent until nearing the end of high school, where my grades were decent but not excellent. Now that I'm at university they are average. It's nearly impossible for me to get motivated to do something unless it's due the next day, and I've started submitting assignments late which I have NEVER let myself do before. I have very high expectations for myself, but then just don't follow through and I can't figure out why.  Basically, I am absolutely terrified that the way I coped with primary and secondary schooling, coupled with "normal, lazy, university student behaviour" will cause the psychiatrist to conclude that I don't have ADHD. I really want help and the idea of someone telling me that I don't need it is making me break down and I can't stop crying.  If you have experience with this/how a psychiatrist goes about diagnosing adult ADHD, any insight would be greatly appreciated.  TL;DR Freaking out that my good grades in school will work against me in getting diagnosed, does this actually happen? What other factors do they take into account when diagnosing?
