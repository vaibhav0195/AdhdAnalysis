Best medicines, helpful habits, coping strategies etc.;;;I am going to have an appointment with a psychiatrist to figure out a good treatment for my diagnosis. The thing is this is the very first appointment of ADHD treatment for me and I have no idea how I will react to each medicine. Do any of you fellow ADHDers have a suggestion as to which medicine I should try first? Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse? This might be a silly question because it might be my medical professional making the decision for me. Also any tips for a 21 year old male newly and officially diagnosed would be appreciated.
