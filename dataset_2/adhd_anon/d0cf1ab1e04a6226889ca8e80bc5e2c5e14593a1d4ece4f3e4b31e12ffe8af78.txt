We are ready to try meds with her and have an appt for that at the end of the month. I am breastfeeding and unable to take meds right now. I also get about 5 hours VERY interupted sleep at night because both of my kids wake me up at all hours. My temper is short as all get out, I'm yelling, I'm always angry and frustrated, school is out and the 7 yr old and 2.5 yr old are constantly whining. I feel like I cannot be a good parent. I'm trying to teach my daughter how to deal with her feelings in a good way and I can't even do that. I throw things, I swear under my breath, sometimes outloud. I feel like the complete lack of sleep for 7 years has totally fucked me.  My 7 year old is a perfectionist to a fault. She wanted to learn how to do cursive this summer so we bought a book. Literally 2 minutes in and she's scribbling over the whole page, throwing her pencil, telling me come help her then pulling the pencil out of my hand when I do. Which in turn makes me infuriated so then I throw the pencil. Like, fuck, I may as well be fucking 7. How do people do this!?! I want her medicated and going to counseling so that she can avoid everything that I had to deal with but I am setting such a bad example. And I feel like my brain, my emotions, my reactions are completely out of my control, which sounds so childish.   TL:DR; Unmedicated parent trying to be a good example for unmedicated child, both clashing and frustrated.
