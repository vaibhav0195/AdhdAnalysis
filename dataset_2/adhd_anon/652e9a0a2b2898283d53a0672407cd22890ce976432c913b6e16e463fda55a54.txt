652e9a0a2b2898283d53a0672407cd22890ce976432c913b6e16e463fda55a54;;;Going to see a doctor next week;;;(So-So english so bare with me)So here's my story, I'll try to make it relatively short for you guys :  In high school, I was the perfect student. Always polite, A+ in every subject, never got in trouble, etc. Got to college, everything crashed. Failed some classes, studying got way harder, below average grades, you know the drill. Ever since I've started college I've hard a really hard time concentrating in class and memorizing shit. Id read it over and over again, highlighted, made cue cards, nothing works. Got diagnosed with depression a month into my first semester(~1 and a half year ago), but refused to take any meds. Generally got better, but I still have frequent mood swings/anxiety/panic attacks/depressive episodes, more so during exam periods (like now), and I get into the cycle of (Can't concentrate -&gt; hard time studying -&gt; fail exam -&gt;depressed about being stupid and failing my exam --&gt; can't concentrate). I'm tired of this shit. I googled my "symptoms" a couple of days ago, and had a "Holy Crap" moment when reading about ADHD. The constant figiting, zoning out when someone talks to me, being disorganized, procrastination... Now I'm lucky to have very supportive parents, but when I told them I suspect I have ADHD their response was "you can't have ADHD you were an excellent student in high school" and "if you had ADHD, you wouldn't be so good at sports" ( I do LOTS of sports. Lifting, competing in martial arts, mountain biking...) Sports are pretty much the only thing I can do for hours. I can't even read a book without stopping at every page because I absolutely have no clue what I just read, or I need to move around. So this might be ADHD, or might not be, idk. But only good can come out of me seeing a doctor.
