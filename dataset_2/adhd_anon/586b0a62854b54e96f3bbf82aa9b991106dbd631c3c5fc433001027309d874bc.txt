586b0a62854b54e96f3bbf82aa9b991106dbd631c3c5fc433001027309d874bc;;;I was writing down strategies to help with my ADD and looking back on them a few minutes later, I realized I stopped one part of the way through;;;It made me chuckle. I've off and on thought I've had ADD. I remember that while having focusing problems a lot in life, my symptoms didn't seem to exactly match the DSM or whatever guides for ADD.  But I think by this point, it doesn't matter. My focusing problems could be the result of my depression or (what I suspect) some (unknown to most doctors) physical problem that exhausts me and ADD is more of a symptom of that than its own diagnosis.  I basically didn't have focusing problems until the age of 13 which doesn't make sense.  But yeah ever since then, I obsessively have to put *every* appointment in my phone and have multiple reminders go off, I'm always setting alarms. If I don't, I just don't remember. I have like 60 reminders continually cycling through my phone.  I'm a writer/musician, and every time I get an idea, I have to write it down or put it in my voice memos within 5 minutes or there's an 80% chance I'll completely forget it. It doesn't matter where I am. If I'm in the middle of a run, I have to do it then and there or I won't remember. At work I'd write down ideas on receipt paper. So over the years I've accumulated literally at least a couple thousand of those. Likely a lot more.   I loved high school because of the external structure and being able to basically survey a ton of amazing subjects. Well it was hard for me then, but... College on the other hand was hell for me, I failed out, took some time off, and then finished with just mediocre performance. Now I'm trying to follow my passions of music-making and writing, which is fucking hard because I'm doing it all by myself.  I'm really good at spinning pencils in multiple ways  Yep cool thx 4 the read
