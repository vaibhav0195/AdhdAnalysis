f8968f0fe00a0da522cb9f6465e80fa23adb9dd1734b447e086ade4037b8afa0;;;I recently self-diagnosed and need some tips!;;;So, anyway, this is a throwway, since my friends and family don't have clue what I'm thinking of and that I'm seeking help for a condition that seems to be making my life as shitty as possible.  Anyway, I'm in college, first year, history, and there's a hell of a lot literature that *I just can't handle*. No concentration, my mind's a mess, everything each and every one of you is already familiar with.  The thing is, I never had to study, but got away with it because I know with words. It's not that I *never* studied, just never as much as I should have to have straight A's. I went for the pass since it was the easy way out, and studying was torture, no matter how interesting it got; the only thing I got right away were languages and history. And now, college + ADD are making one of my loves hell.  I have no idea how to study, since no method I ever heard from my friends ever worked (which I can now atrribute to ADD), and now I *really* have to study if i want this, and it's killing me that I just can't. The wall is more appealing that the books they give us!  Please, if you have any tips for studying and actually not getting consumed by fear and distractions, share!  Thank you in advance! ;)   **TL;DR - Newly self-diagnosed ADD 19yo needs tips for studying so she wouldn't flunk first year of college and have to go home and give up completly.**  EDIT; There are very few experts on the matter in my small country, and all *four or five* of them are in the capital. There is only one institution and a private clinic. So I turned to the institution for a testing and am waiting for a reply. Will update when/if I get a response! :)
