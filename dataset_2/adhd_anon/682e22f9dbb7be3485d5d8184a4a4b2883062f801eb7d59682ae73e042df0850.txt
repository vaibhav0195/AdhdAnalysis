682e22f9dbb7be3485d5d8184a4a4b2883062f801eb7d59682ae73e042df0850;;;Having a Few Probs with Adderall, looking for advice and others experience;;;I took Adderall about a year ago for a few months and had EXTREME negative side effects. I recently decided to try taking it again. A lot of the side effects I think were caused by unintentional misuse, lack of understanding of ADHD (I thought meds alone would 'fix' me and didn't take a comprehensive approach), and some already existing emotional issues (in hindsight it's painfull obvious that I was depressed for a little over a year and I think Adderall amplified it).  Since this is my second attempt at the med, I really want to make sure I'm doing things "right" before I make a decision on to continue taking it or switching off it again. So I have some questions (my doctor admits he isn't the expert, so I'm hoping I can find some supplementary info here. It sems like people who actually use a drug are better equipped to answer these type of questions). **The paragraphs are to explain and clarify, but I know it's quite lengthy. So feel free to just skim for the bolded parts!**  **How long is Adderall supposed to last?**: I know that everyone is probably a little different. But what's a reasonable window of time to actively be "on" Adderall. I am having a problem where sometimes I experience insomnia. Sometimes it's obvious that I just took it too late in the day. However, I also wonder what the "proper" time window is. Last year, I realize that I was dosed up WAY too fast and that my body didn't have time to adjust. I was basically tweaking at some points. So I don't know how to tell if I just need to take my meds earlier in general, or if it's possible that my dosage might be too high and that I need to lower it for a period of time.   **What can I eat?!**: This one is important to me. A lot of people say that Adderall is an adjustment and that they lose some weight before they figure it all out. However, I don't really have a lot of wiggle room before any weight loss would be concerning. Which is bad, because the worst side effect I'm noticing with Adderall this time is the diet/appetite changes. Since my initial diagnosis, I've used marijuana to help combat this. I'd come home and smoke a bowl and it was a way to basically hit "stop" and come down from my med at the end of the day. I love weed. I'd like it to be a part of my life for a long time. But I was smoking so frequently and so much because of my medication, that the nature of my relationship with weed changed. When I noticed that my use had become more of a habit than a special treat, I realized I needed to change or risk becoming addicted. I've decided to take a extended t-break and to only use it for recreation when I start again. But that also means I need to figure out a new way to combat what's fairly bad appeite changes.  For instance: on Wednesday I hate about half a box of macaroni and cheese. On Thursday I literally ate nothing (I really did try but could literally not force myself to swallow). Yesterday I got so dizzy I had to lie down in the morning. It was obvious that my body was desperate for food. I was able to eat 3 large apple slices (about 1/2 of a standard sized apple I think). Then, very late at night, I was able to eat an entire man-which  The problem is that even though I know I need to, sometimes I literally can not force myself to eat. This has actually been something I've had happened to me before I started taking Adderall (though it was only once or twice and significantly less extreme). I would go try to eat and would literally start gagging. I'd spit up food like a baby or have such an intense feeling of nasuea that I somtimes would have to go to the bathroom for fear I might actually start throwing up. If I smell food that I don't want (which is pretty much all food), I'll start gagging as well. **It isn't just that I don't feel good or like what I'm eating. It's that my body seems to have an actual physical reaction when I try to force it that prevents me from eating**. Previously, it happened during periods where I had appetite loss as a result of anxiety. I was never able to find a way around it and simply dealt with it until I got a hold of the anxiety. This weird reaction to eating when I don't want to make it very hard to be a responsible Adderall user. It's particularly hard to make myself eat during the day because I'm in public (these aren't small gags. You can see, and often hear, them.)   It seems like a lot of people who have problems with appetite loss try to work around it. They eat large meals outside of the window of Adderall and force themselves to eat small snacks throughout the day. I am going to try really hard to do this. But there's also a lot of people who, like me, use marijuana to help combat the food issues. **I'm wondering if there's any 3rd type who knows of a non-weed way to induce hunger and appetite.**  Either way, I'm going to try to eat more and better. I just learned that ideally you should eat a substantial breakfast, wait about an hour, take adderall, and then wait at least two hours before eating again. I also learned that you should avoid highly acidic things while on it as it can mess up absorbtion. I don't know if this is true but **some people also reported noticing an increase in lactose intolerance while on it. I'm already aware of a mild lactose intolerance, so I'd like to know if I really should start being more mindful about my dairy consumption.* (I actually only notice digestive issues if I've eaten LARGE amounts of something, aka a tub of ice cream by myself in 48 hours, but a ton of dairy products will cause my face to break out like a motherfucker). I also learned that people who are lactose intolerant should avoid protein drinks. Unfortunately, this is kind of what I was thinking I was gonna do to make sure I remained healthy.  **I'm trying to find a balance of foods that are nutritious(or at the very least not bad for you), calorie dense (for obvious reasons), that work well with Adderall (like now I know that chugging orange juice is a bad idea), and that I'll be able to make myself eat.**   Most of the food advice I see tend to be about the daytime snacking food. Things like nutrigrain bars, nuts (sunflower seeds and almonds primarily), fruits (bananas and apples), and crackers being the most common. I do need help finding daytime snacks. I couldn't even eat almonds normally, so I doubt me on Adderall could do it. (They're so dry!)  **I'm also wondering about changes in diet regarding actual meals. Nothing I can think of  for dinner (or breakfast) seems appealing, which makes it that much harder to eat.** Since there seem to be overall trends in the snack of Adderall users, I wondered if that meant there were similarities in meals as well. Like an Adderall cookbook or something! (Though they'd probably need a title that didn't encourage people to associate adderall and meth more than they already do)  **What Can I Do about the muscle tension, soreness, and cramping?** I have TMD. I've already learned a lot about how to prevent grinding and jaw problems from my TMD doctor (sleeping on your back or side with a body pillow, using a heating pad, stretching your jaw, having your resting mouth be slightly open rather than your teeth touching). And my jaw got a lot better! But then I started taking Adderall....  It isn't that I'm outright clenching. I don't think I'm grinding in my sleep either (sleeping on your back SERIOUSLY helps with this FYI). But I notice that I'm overall just more tense when I'm on Adderall. I know I need to "loosen up", but I have no idea how.   I'm basically wondering if there's any food or little tricks to help combat the muscle tension and pain. I'm also starting to notice pretty constant low level calf pain (I'm in college so I'm fairly sedentary, but I walk everywhere including to and from home) and starting to get some back pain.   I'm really not a fan of medications and prescriptions. I hate Adderall. But I hate every ADHD med I've tried. I don't think I like pharmaceuticals in general. I seem, for whatever reason, to be more prone to side effects than most people. This is the reason that I've turned down my doctor for anxiety meds. It's also why I didn't pursue anti-depressants. I'd preferably like to avoid having to ask for muscle relaxants (which would be an unreasonable request for my level of muscle problems if it wasn't for the fact that I already had jaw issues before and I was already at risk of re-locking my jaws without the meds). I also want to avoid asking for sleep meds because I know how extreme those are (I can't take diphenhydramine because it gives me restless legs. The last time I tried I literally ended up doing squats at 3 am for an hour because of how extreme it was).   **Is there a way to stop switching from anti-social to overly-talkative?** Last time,I got extremely aggressive and nasty. Now, I seem to fluctuate between avoiding and craving interaction. I don't think that I'm outright aggressive right now, but **I feel like I'm less emotionally attached to people than before.** Like, I just didn't really message/text people back for like 3 days. I'd read the message and not reply to it immediately and tell myself I'd do it later. And then just never do it. Which is weird because these are my friends and I usually like talking to them. I also have no interest in men/dating/hooking up/etc. I just can't make myself give a shit. Last year I ended up alienating myself from most of my friends and it was a huge mistake. **I don't feel as actively annoyed this year, but am worried by my increase in apathy about social involvement.** I don't want to become a zombie who only goes to school and goes home to be alone.  It's particularly weird though because I'm actually super wordy on Adderall (clearly, just look at this post). I talked to my roommate for over three hours a few days ago. I noticed that when texting my best friend, I was saying A LOT in comparison to her. **It's like I swing from having no interest in interacting with other people to suddenly being TOO social.** I doubt there's any physiological way to change this side effect. But I'm wondering if people have had this problem and found any tips/tricks/rules/etc. that have helped them balance this so that they're more balanced rather than this social binge/purge that it seems like I'm beginning.  **what's a good schedule for taking these? I'm not sure if it's good for you to take breaks or not.** My doctor says thinks like "You should take it on days you feel like you need it. Don't not take it when you need it because you think you're not supposed to." But he never really explain if purposefully not taking it a day or two a week is good for you or not. I understand I should take it when I need it and not take it when I don't. But, I'm in school. I could benefit from taking it every day. Because even on the weekends I'm still studying.But I'm also doing significantly less studying. Depending on how dramatic the differences are, I might decide that it'd be better to suffer through studying sans meds on the weekend (or cramming harder during the week so I don't have to study during the weekend).  **How bad is mixing alcohol and adderall?**I'm sure it's not good, but really drinking in general is kind of just poision for your body so obviously anyone who drinks is willing to sacrifice some level of health. I'm just wondering how much worse that sacrifice becomes if you've also taken Adderall that day. **I'm also wondering what to expect if I do choose to drink.** I stopped drinking when I was on it last year. I haven't been drinking recently because I haven't really been going out,and I much prefer getting high to getting drunk. But,now that I'm not smoking, I'm sure that I'm going to start wanting a glass of wine or three on Friday nights. So I have absolutely no idea what to expect or to look out for. I'm also wondering what kind of drinks people like? I mean does anyone notice a change in their preferences similarly to how they notice a change in diet? Because I got a whiff of vodka last week (which admittedly just smells bad in general), and I'm not sure I have ever been more repulsed by a smell in my life. I kept getting ghost whiffs of it for hours after.  **Does Adderall Change what kind of foods you like or simply amplify cravings?** Sugar cravings seems to be common for Adderall. But I've read the theory that this might be due to the tendency of people to not eat enough on their meds. So, instead of adderall=liking sugar, it might actually be adderall=not eating=low blood sugar=your body craving sugar. Absolutely none of the food I have right now is appealing. I'm wondering if it's a good or bad idea to take Adderall on the day I go grocery shopping next time. If the changes in preferences is pretty stable, then it'd make sense to go while on it so that I'll know what kind of stuff my body seems to want or not want. But if Adderall just amplifies cravings, then it'd probably be a terrible idea to go on it. I'd end up buying all the food that I was craving that day, which then wouldn't be applicable to cravings I had for the rest of the days.   **Women: What sexual side effects did you notice (and how did you deal with them if you did)** The only thing I've really heard is that dry mouth also means dry vagina. But I feel like a drug that so dramatically changes so much about you must have more side effects than just needing to start using lube.
