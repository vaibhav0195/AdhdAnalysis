9077429fb7d849969d0538560011a5f7ce7820c39c468dc42be02621e5ef89d0;;;Went to GP today, meeting a psychiatrist in a week BUT..;;;My main goal for May was to meet up with a doctor to talk about my potential problem. June 9th, i finally did it but.. I prepared a note for a doctor and ended up crying within seconds of reading it. I got prescribed medication for anxiety and mild depression.  But she booked an appointment for June 17th for me to see another doctor.  Hopefully i won't end up crying my eyes out then as well. This is so overwhelming.   Wish me luck
