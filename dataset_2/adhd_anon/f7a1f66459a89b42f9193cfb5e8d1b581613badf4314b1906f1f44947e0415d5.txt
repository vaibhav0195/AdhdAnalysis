I love educating people about stuff related to field. I also have ADHD, and recently wrote a big ole nasty paper on ADHD that I used for a qualifying exam (which I passed).   tl;dr I have read about 100 peer reviewed papers/books on ADHD and everything I say is backed up with scientific peer reviewed literature.    **You should always be critical of "experts" taking about ADHD.**  * Often, journalists and other various people who claim to be ADHD “experts” trivialize ADHD with their latest “theories” and “causes,” **most of which have no understanding of the scientific findings of ADHD**.   * **Many of these "experts" are just grabbing for attention at some media outlet**.   * The problem I have with this stuff is that it does a disservice to those of us with the disorder, making it hard for us to get through all the bullshit and see what ADHD really is.  **What is ADHD?**  * **ADHD is characterized by developmentally discordant hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattention across multiple settings (DSM-5)**.   * **School is just one area where ADHD is noticeable.** But people with ADHD are obviously different than their same-age peers at church, scouts, recess, birthday parties, and during TV time.   *  **I cannot emphasize this enough** behavior in settings that are difficult for normal children and people, those with ADHD are markedly impaired/worse. It doesn' just happen in schools.   * **There are three flavors of ADHD**: inattentive, hyperactive/impulsive, and combined type.   **Conceptual framework of ADHD**  Evidence suggests that the primary disability associated with ADHD is with behavioral inhibition.  * The core symptoms: hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattention are influenced by a deficit in executive functioning (See Barkley, 1997). **Barkley’s theory states that Executive functions support many cognitive processes and these deficits lead to a reduced ability inhibit behavior.** Barkley has been cited over 5000 times in peer-reviewed journals, the evidence suggests that his theory is valid and it allows for some solid predictions about ADHD. Put simply, Barkleys theory really explains ADHD.  * **Deficits in these areas of executive functioning make it difficult for students with ADHD to inhibit task-irrelevant responses, execute goal-directed responses, sustain persistence in pursuit of a goal, re-engage after distractions and control behavior from what one has learned previously (Barkley, 1997).**   * **These difficulties may manifest as less time on task compared to peers, disruptive classroom behavior, poor persistence on academic tasks, greater distractibility, and inattentiveness in classroom settings (DuPaul &amp; Stoner, 2004; Barkley, 2006).**  **What causes ADHD?**  * Everything points to the **frontal areas of the brain**.   * Which is why people with ADHD 100 years ago were called **minimally brain damaged,** because we acted a lot like people who have had a brain injury, except there was no obvious traumatic event as a cause. Think of Phineas Gage, the poster child of frontal lobe injury.  * The fMRI, MRI, CT scans, EEGs, studies all show that people with ADHD have different frontal lobe functioning than those without ADHD. *  **Metabolites in urine hint that we produce fewer dopamine and norepinephrine**. We just make less dopamine than those without ADHD * **ADHD is a lot like diabetes**, we don’t make enough of something. This is why stimulants are such an effective treatment.  **What makes the frontal lobe shitty?**  * **ADHD is highly genetic**, twin studies and adoptive studies have proved this. For example height heritability is like .80-.91 whereas ADHD is .75 to .97 and averaging about .78.   * **Non-shared and shared environmental factors are astonishingly low compare to the power of genetics with ADHD, accounting for less than 10% of the relationship**.   * **School, bad parenting, or any other fault of society does not meaningfully cause ADHD.**  **ADHD Is caused by shitty genes, that lead to an underproduction of neurotransmitters, which cause executive functioning deficits and trouble delaying prepotent responses.**  * **TLDR; Its not your fault if you have ADHD. You are not lazy. You are not stupid.**
