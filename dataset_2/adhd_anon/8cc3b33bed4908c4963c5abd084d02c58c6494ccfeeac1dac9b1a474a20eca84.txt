8cc3b33bed4908c4963c5abd084d02c58c6494ccfeeac1dac9b1a474a20eca84;;;ADHD and restlessness?;;;First time posting here although i've been reading for a while, I've got an appointment coming up soon with a pyschiatrist but I have a question for all you ADHDers out there.   Do you feel restless? I don't know how to describe it but let's say your doing something (studying, writing a paper, etc) and you get a feeling in your stomach and you just have to move and it feels undescribable. It's like a knot in your stomach? You can't focus on anything because you just feel inpatient. Restlessness.  No idea what I typed really but can anybody relate? It generally happens when doing something that requires attention that i can't give.
