My psychiatrist said the reason she prescribed me Brintellix was because it could help the symptoms of ADHD while treating my mild depression (which, for the record, I sort of disagree about having).  I started on half a pill for the first week, and within the first hour I would get terrible nausea - I had to struggle not to vomit, which was definitely a problem especially on days I had to go to work. It got easier eventually, but once I started taking whole pills it came back. Now it's not as bad as it first was, but if I haven't slept too well it can get quite bad. I've also started getting nearly daily headaches that go away in an hour or so, but they can get quite bad. I get migraines now and then and Brintellix has made them slightly more common. For the past few weeks I've also had trouble sleeping (waking up too early), but I'm not quite certain about the meds having an effect on that.  The biggest issue I'm having with the medication is that I have noticed absolutely zero effect. My concentration is just as bad and I feel like after starting medication I'm even more forgetful than before. The only effects I've been able to attribute to the meds are the nausea and the headaches.  My psychiatrist said that if the meds don't work out too well, we could either up the dosage from 10mg to 20mg and/or start taking methylphenidate - although after these few weeks on Brintellix I can't say I would feel too hopeful about upping my dosage, I'd rather change to another medication.  I'm having my next appointment in a few weeks, and I'm wondering if I should just stop taking Brintellix or keep going until then. I've been taking Brintellix for 4-5 weeks now (the meds should have at least some effect within the second week). Any suggestions on what I should do?  **tl;dr** Been taking Brintellix for 4-5 weeks for ADHD, still no effect
