I was diagnosed two months ago with inattentive ADD.  I was initially put on Ritalin 5mg 2x daily. I was doing swimmingly, everything was peachy, and then about two weeks ago I was switched over to Concerta 18mg. It was horrible. It didn't metabolize properly, so I was grouchy and tired all the time, with no ability to focus or do anything.  My psychiatrist quickly switched me back to the Ritalin 5mg 3x and when I reported the following week it wasn't helping, she upped to 10 mg. I have been growing continually more anxious throughout the past week. My brain feels like it's stuttering. I was supposed to write a letter to my psychiatrist updating her on the situation, but I couldn't get it together to string it up for three days. My sleep is also way more erratic. In this case, I was worse on the Ritalin than off, because today I have not taken any and I feel loads better.  I have my next appointment on Monday and I don't think I am going to take any Ritalin before then. I am very uncomfortable with the idea of continuing on Ritalin.  Has anybody else experienced this? Could the Concerta have caused this?
