If I get put on meds, would I stop fidgeting/playing with things?;;;For the last couple of years I've considered that I likely have ADHD, and after describing some things to my doctor (lack of focus, forgetfulness) while talking about something else, they asked if I've ever had a formal diagnosis of ADD/ADHD, which I haven't. I'm scheduled to see them again next month, and after reading some things here and on /r/ADD, I'm going to try bringing it up.  However, I've always been a fidgeter. I'm almost always playing with my toes or fingers while sitting (which unfortunately includes biting nails), and if I'm standing around or talking to somebody, I always seem to pick up something and start playing with that while talking.  While it does have its downsides (apparently as a kid I used to break a lot of things in my dad's office doing it) it does increase the number of calories burnt in a day. One article I read awhile ago quoted about 300 calories a day. Added on to the fact that I generally enjoy it, it's something I'd actually fear losing if I started taking medication.  Has anybody around here been a fidgeter before starting on medication, then stopped fidgeting once on meds?
