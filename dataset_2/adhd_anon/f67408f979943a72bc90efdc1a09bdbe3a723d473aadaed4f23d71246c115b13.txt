I take 50mg of Vyvanse every day and I feel very focused and together when I take it. When I don't, my head is so foggy I just want to lay down and sleep all day. I usually get my prescription at the beginning of every month and I'll be on vacation on that day with my family and I won't be able to get it until a week later this time so I'm skipping a few days to make it last and it's rough. Anyone know of anything I can do to feel more awake or clear headed without medication while I don't take the meds?
