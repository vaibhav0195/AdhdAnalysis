They have claimed that over the past 1.5 years (coincidentally the duration of our relationship), they haven't been able to perform up to their potential/expectations in college, and now in the workplace.   They've functioned as a high performer in school their whole life - they made a top university, achieved good grades, landed an amazing and impressive job. Now, they seem insecure that they can't achieve what is expected of them, both by themselves, and by their peers/managers.   My take - I've honestly been pretty ignorant of mental health diagnoses. Right or wrong, I believe that we live in an era of over-diagnoses. I understand that's not a popular opinion, and I don't mean to offend anyone with my beliefs.   As it pertains to my SO, I feel as though they are taking a shortcut/cheating. They can't perform well at work, and want to take a magic pill in order to get them to where they want to be. I disagree with that with every fiber of my existence.   Furthermore, I'm absolutely terrified of the pill itself. I'm not at all comfortable with it's likeness to meth. I don't like the idea of reliance. I feel that once they go down the road, how can you ever decide to not take it anymore? They claim they're going to go month-to-month, but I frankly don't believe it.    They're scared to tell their parents, for fear of disapproval or being labeled as having ADHD for life... But isn't that exactly what comes with the territory if you are going to be taking the medication? Am I crazy to think that even they might think there's something immoral/wrong if they are hiding it from their parents?   Please help. I know that I am pretty ignorant. Help me be better.
