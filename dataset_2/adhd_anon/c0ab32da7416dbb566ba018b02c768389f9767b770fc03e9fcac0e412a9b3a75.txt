I thought I needed it because I've struggled with depression my whole life; I am anhedonic, and recently if I'm off of work, I don't even eat or brush my teeth until noon, and i just can't do laundry for the life of me. So if Effexor decreases serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, while the adderall releases norepinephrine from the nerve endings, do they somehow counteract each other? The reason I'm asking is because I've noticed I simply don't care any more when I'm at work, and it used to be the only thing still motivating me. I am just suddenly ok with being average at my job and I've been flaking, which is super unlike me. I don't like it and I think I probably have to ask for Wellbutrin which I heard was more of an upper and worked better with Adderall. Any input will be greatly appreciated!
