More specifically, where do I start?;;;I (female) was diagnosed with ADD (no hyperactivity) at 17 and I am now 29 and never finished high school. I've had crappy CRAPPY jobs up until now and have decided that I want to finish high school and actually go on to trying university.   I realize that after reading this and /r/ADD is that I will probably need to try meds. I've never had much success with these but to be honest I've never given meds a good try. However, I am still breastfeeding my 18 month old and plan to stop when she is 2 years old. So it will be a full 6 months before I can go that route. Until then I can still work on my single most frustrating problem: Time management.  I'm just not sure where to start. It just seems so incredibly overwhelming. Writing lists is a huge issue for me, I feel so SO stupid having to write out stuff like "Take a shower 9am, do laundry 9:30am, etc.", however I realize that it's stuff like this that is going to help me when I go back to school. Has anyone else felt this way? And if you overcame it, how?  I do plan on more research on this area, but I am looking for advice on a starting point. I think that if I can get the ball rolling, I can move forward with managing my time.
