I'm at a complete loss.;;;On my meds I do actually start tasks, but I'm so damn inefficient and get barely nowhere, even after hours of 'work'.  I'm thinking/understanding quickly for maybe 45 minutes, and then just slip off into hours of mental blurriness and inefficiency.   Before diagnosis/meds I almost never started or did anything, but in the times I actually did (i.e at the absolute last second), I was so incredibly efficient.   Example A - on meds:   Assignment due in 2 weeks. Leave it to last 3 **days**, spend 16 **hours** on only 1 section of it (taking ages to understand content or make progress, as well as getting constantly sidetracked on unimportant things), barely start the other sections, even the 1 section I did wasn't very good. = Failed the assignment.   Example B - before diagnosis/meds:  Assignment due in 2 weeks, leave it to the last 1.5 **hours**, work at 110% efficiency in those 1.5 hours, lazer focused  (+ could understand/learn things so quickly) --&gt; Get mark of 75% on the assignment.   I've tried both Ritalin and Dextroamphetamine (my current medication), at all the different doses. I'm at a complete loss. My psychiatrist thinks since I'm actually doing things (overall I am doing more, although still not very much) i'm going well, but it feels like I used to be really smart and just unable to make myself do anything, but now I'm unintelligent and slow to learn/understand things, and the work I do is such low quality.   Does anyone have any advice/input that could help?   Side note: I'm always really mentally fatigued/exhausted when not on meds, it's such an incredible struggle to overcome that barrier of fatigue to even think about or do anything, in addition to the other typical issues.  HOWEVER, I **was** definitely like this before diagnosis/meds.
