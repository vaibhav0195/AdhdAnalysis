My husband and I both have it, we have different symptoms but a lot is still very much the same and its causes a lot of issues in our relationship. I have looked on my normal places but everything is "you partner does this and your non adhd partner doesnt understand" or some other form of. Everywhere I have seen is that there is one with and one without. Not both.   If anyone knows of anywhere that would be lovely thank you.
