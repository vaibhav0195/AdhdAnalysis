My assignment was due 3 days ago. My instructor made it clear that we only get 3 days after the due date to hand it in with marks off otherwise we get an automatic zero. Deadline has passed.  I was meaning to start on this assignment but I just can't. I feel overwhelmed, depressed, lost.  I have an online test due tonight and a group project due in 2 days which I haven't even started on. It's funny, I feel so motivated to do schoolwork and I have so many dreams. But it's too hard. I'm giving up.
