I got together with a friend to study for an exam. After three hours, he said that I really lack concentration and that he was like me before he was diagnosed with ADHD (or ADD, I don't know what he said, I guess I wasn't paying attention ironically). So he gave me adderall and I have never experienced such a productive stint of eight hours.  So for the last semester, I kept taking adderall maybe one 25mg (or was it 20mg?) pill per week, roughly. I'm usually a 3.4 GPA student, but my GPA last semester was 3.85, and the classes were significantly harder than the ones I previously had.  This semester I stopped taking adderall because I didn't really think I have ADHD and I thought taking adderall to study was like taking molly to party - it helps, but it's not necessary if you really get to it.  Now I'm here sitting, I manage to do roughly 5 exercises per day and I lack absolutely any attention or concentration that school requires.  But I digress. I suspect I have ADHD but I am not sure. I want to get a psychological exam done. I do not want to appear like I'm going to the doctor to get adderall or to appear like I just want to psychological exam to fake ADHD and get drugs. I feel like I have a genuine problem.  How can I ask my doctor for a psychological exam without appearing like a drug fiend trying to get adderall?   Frankly, I don't care about the drugs. I want to fix my problem, and that's it. They can prescribe me any obscure attention helping drug, I wouldn't care as long as it helps me get stuff done.
