Need some advice...;;;Well, my 8-year-old son has been diagnosed by a child-psychologist as ADHD. The psychologist recommended we discuss with the pediatrician, and the pediatrician is likely to recommend Ritalin (or some equivalent medication).  I'm neutral on this (though I would prefer not to medicate him if we can avoid it), but my wife is dead-set against "drugging our child" and "changing his personality". I don't feel like we have enough information to make an informed decision, and every resource I've found on the internet is pretty clearly pushing some agenda or other.  I'm at the end of my rope here. Is Ritalin (or whatever) "safe"? Are there long-term side effects? I've read about higher risk of suicide, heart failure, psychosis, and everything else from hairy palms to hysterical blindness. I have no idea what to believe any more.  To my untrained eye, my son doesn't seem to be hyperactive, but he does have MASSIVE problems concentrating long enough to finish homework or other tasks.  EDIT: Guys, thank you SO MUCH for all your advice. Especially those of you who have lived with it since a young age. I really appreciate it! For now, since it is a verrrry *mild* case, we are taking the diagnosis to his school to get him a modified IEP, and talking with his pediatrician. I think for now we will hold off on the medication, but after a lot of discussion, we're definitely more ready for that, when the time comes.  Thanks again, rADDit!  This is becoming a real source of friction between my wife and I. I feel like I'm being open-minded about potential solutions, and she feels that I'm a monster who is trying to "give drugs to babies".  Please help! (Preferably with medical information, and not marital advice :-)
