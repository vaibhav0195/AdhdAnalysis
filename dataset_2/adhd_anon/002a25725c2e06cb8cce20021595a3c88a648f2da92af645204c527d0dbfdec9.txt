I was previously diagnosed by a psychologist with ADHD-PI and my psychologist sent the write up (or whatever paper it is that says I have ADHD) to the psychiatrist. However, this psychiatrist said I didn't really "fit" the diagnosis for ADHD and I was more likely depressed or something. This was making me very mad that he didn't think that I had ADHD, and on top of that he was kind of being a jerk. He finally gave in and gave me a prescription and said "we'll see if this helps" or something along those lines.   Granted it's the first day, I feel pretty good. Much more focused and I'm less fidgety(I actually could keep still while watching TV!). I don't feel hyper, which is a good sign. My mouth and throat are slightly dry, and my stomach has a little cramping, but I think there are very few side effects. It's 1:43pm and I have a small appetite so I might have a little something for lunch, too.  I was pretty scared to start taking it because I thought it wouldn't work and I didn't have ADHD, but it seems to be working great. Hopefully it continues to go well.
