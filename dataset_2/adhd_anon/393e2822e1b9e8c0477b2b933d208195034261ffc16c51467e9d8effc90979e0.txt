I was doing alright at the old dosage but I noticed the effects diminishing slightly after about 7 months.   She told me if I find I don't like this new dosage to let them know when I call next month to get another script.   So what I want to do is bring my one month prescription to the pharmacy and have them only dispense a weeks worth and keep the rest on hold. That way if after a week I don't like it, I can have it switched back and won't be stuck for a month with meds that don't work well.  My thinking is that the DEA only allows them to prescribe for a month based on days. If I am only given a week's amount, then afterwards I can get more.  Is this possible?
