My [22/F] boyfriend [23/M] has ADD and was diagnosed when he was little. When he was 19, he had to have a mechanical heart valve put in and is on blood thinners for the rest of his life to prevent blood clots/strokes. Therefore, he cannot use ADD medication because it affects how his body metabolizes the blood thinners. I have met a lot of people in my life with ADD and have read a lot about it since I started dating my boyfriend. He does exceptionally well for someone who is not medicated and I understand why he does a lot of the things that he does.   I help him remember a lot of things. Everything from important events and doctor appointments to trying to help him find his shoes and keys. I was thinking that we need to work on developing some kind of system. Right now he just tells me things that he does not want to forget and then relies on me to remember them. I don't have a problem with this, but I was wondering if anyone else out there is in my position or has ADD and has a system that works really well for them. Any and all advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks Reddit!
