a3cabaa511356705c7fa4738e3fd241cc6426082f6d43770ee9c2b4203f1938a;;;I seem to have circled back to ADHD;;;So I have a problem with freezing up?/writers block?/mental blankness?,  some type of block, i'm going to try and describe it best i can.  I freeze up and can't do anything.  I can't be creative, i can't write or draw.  Someone tells me a word and asks me to say the first thing that comes to mind.... i freeze up.  At the same time I've got so many things i want to write... i just can't.  I do have anxiety problems but this happens when i'm not feeling anxious as well.  Does this sound like ADHD at all?      I've been searching for years for a solution to my problem, it's pretty much destroyed any chance of passing anything.  It's also effecting everyday stuff, i pretty much can't look after myself.  And I HAVE been diagnosed with ADHD (without hyperactivity) and Aspergers at different points but my psychologist just doesn't want to address them (I've been told he's shit and I have to go see someone else).
