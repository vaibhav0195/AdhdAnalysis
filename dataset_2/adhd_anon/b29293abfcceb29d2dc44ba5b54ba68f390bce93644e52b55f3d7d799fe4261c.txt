b29293abfcceb29d2dc44ba5b54ba68f390bce93644e52b55f3d7d799fe4261c;;;21 year old, diagnosed with AD(h)D, via psych from another country, got concerta, what now;;;Hello guys, after being told adhd doesnt exist by my psychs and given bunch of ssris and benzos, i went on a little trip. Eventually I found about this one psychatriast who spoke with my mom and me, and said Im a rare case of undiagnosed AD(H)D-er.   He gave me a RX for 18mg Concerta for 3 months , and said to find another psych in my country or pay him a visit.    Although my country does have health insurence , I don't want to have AD(H)D label as it might later become more of a burden when applying for a job or going for higher ranks in law/government jobs.    Anyway, any tips how/when to take it?  Will I build tolerance fast? If I do, how to lower it ?    This chit cost me ~150 euros already,  that's a lot in my country.
