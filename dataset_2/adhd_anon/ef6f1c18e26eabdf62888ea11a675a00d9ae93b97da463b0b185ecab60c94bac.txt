ef6f1c18e26eabdf62888ea11a675a00d9ae93b97da463b0b185ecab60c94bac;;;ADHD and IQ;;;Hi, I was wondering, when I got diagnosed for ADHD I took an IQ test also (I didn't know I was at the time), and my IQ turned out to be 112. It's considered "Superior Intelligence", but many people these days have an IQ of 110+, so I'm not really viewing it that way.   Since then, I have now been being treated for ADHD with Adderall and I was wondering, if I took that IQ test again, would my IQ go up? I have been performing better in school too, much better. My gpa in my last semester in High School was like a 3.0 or something and when I took three summer college classes (that were very fast-paced), got a gpa of 3.4 by the end of it (my high school gpa did not carry over and these were college courses, not high school ones, AND they were fast-paced, too). And it's said that in a study, children with low socioeconomic status that were adopted into middle class ones would have their IQ increase by 15-20 pts. Not the same situation, but they were getting better learning, and I have been now able to apply myself better, so I figured I might just mention that even though surface-level it doesn't have much correlation, it still shows the possibility of how IQ can change a lot.  Also, did I take an IQ test that took into account my ADHD? Meaning, that now that I am being treated, if I took another IQ test (where it would now know I am being treated for ADHD, i.e. a regular IQ test), then would I just score the same? A 112? Does ADHD tests require the IQ tests to take into account that person has ADHD, or does it vary depending on the test? My Psychologist also said that when I was taking all these tests, it would account for more than just ADHD. So, there's that too.
