What was the etiquette for doing so? I know if you just switch doctors for other reasons, they can send over all the notes and medical history from the last one, but since this guy technically isn't a doctor anymore I'm not sure if that would work, or if I would just need to start new...The latter makes me nervous as I'm two days from starting college again.    The reasons for him losing the licence are pretty unrelated to his medical practice by the way, not like he was giving out bad diagnosis or anything.
