Have you had any success with **legal** alternatives or methods?;;;Hello /r/ADHD.   I have been diagnosed and treated for ADHD for 14 years. My ADHD diagnosis has been confirmed several times by multiple psychiatrists as I moved throughout my life. With my medication I was able to get an engineering degree from a top university. From there, I was able to skip a masters and get a doctorate in less than 4 years. During my doctorate, I published 5 papers, presented at a world conference, applied for a patent, wrote a 300 page dissertation, and even found time to learn some french on the weekends. Afterwards, I accepted a job offer to work in France as the project leader on a multi-million euro project. But this was the normal me - the me on my medication.   Here is the problem. ADHD medication is highly controlled in France and the French health care does not acknowledge ADHD as a real issue. I have spent 2 years in France talking to doctors, psychologists, a neurologist, and none have done anything to help. Without my medication I am useless. I haven't published anything, my research is a mess, and my lab notebook is non existent, and i honestly feel like i am failing my current employers. I am not the same person I was.   So, with that said. I am willing to try anything to help same my job, career, and personal life having gained 60 pounds in these two years. I have heard about sleeping more or lower sugar intake but have you guys had any success with anything?Maybe no coffee? Tons of coffee? Teas? Exercise? Vitamins?  Anything at all. It must be legal, I am looking to save my job, not looking to get deported.   And please don't say talk to your psychiatrist. They have told me they cant help me.
