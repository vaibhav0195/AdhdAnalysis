I'm struggling with feelings of guilt and shame that I thought I had put behind me a long time ago with the treatment of my depression.  It feels like I've failed in some way.  I know that this isn't true, and I hope to get over it in time, but I could use some support or words of advice at the moment.  I haven't felt this worthless in years, honestly.  I'm also looking to move to the UK at some point and I'm wondering how it will all work.  I was reading some of the wiki material for this subreddit and how you can only be diagnosed by an ADHD specialist in the UK, and that can take up to a year.  Does that mean I'd have to go without medication and treatment for a year, or does it make a difference if I've been diagnosed in the US first?  Did anyone else experience feelings of shame like this when they were first diagnosed? I haven't even been able to tell my spouse yet, I've just told him I've been put on a new medication.  I'm not normally like this about mental health issues (I'm known for being really straightforward and vocal about them) so it's been hitting me pretty hard.  Thanks in advance for any help!
