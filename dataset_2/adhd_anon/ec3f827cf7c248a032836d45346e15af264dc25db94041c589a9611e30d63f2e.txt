First, a little context. I go to a very academicly challenging boarding school, and love it. I thrive in a busy environment (like many of you, I don't deal well with downtime). However I am having a lot of trouble doing my junior year AP US reading, it is very dry so it is really hard to concentrate. Every night we have about 20 pages of reading, and some nights I will start it and not finish it, other nights I won't even be able to start it. This is effecting my grade, I have a C/C+ average in AP US when in every other class (including other AP courses) I am in the B+ to A+ range.   I take 40mg of vyvanse every morning at around 7:30. This has worn off by the end of the day when I sit down to do the reading. Because of the hectic life of boarding school I don't have time to complete reading during the day, only in the evening once my meds have worn off. I really don't want to take more medication in the evening simply because it would screw with my already wacky sleep schedule. So are there any tricks that veterans of this class or others like it might have to share with me? Are there any ways that I might make it more interesting (I have tried rewards systems with candy, but my self control is really low and I just end up eating it all before I finish). Any suggestions would be MUCH appreciated!   PS. Forgive any weird typos, I am writing this on my phone.  **TL;DR Anyone have any tricks for getting boring or tedious tasks done without the use of medication?**
