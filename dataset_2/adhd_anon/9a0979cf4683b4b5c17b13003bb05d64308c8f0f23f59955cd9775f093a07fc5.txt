My son has been diagnosed with ADHD and a sensory processing disorder by 3 professionals.We have done all sorts of behavioral therapy and interventions with him. He is also in a special Pre k program for kids with disabilities. He is very bright too. The doctors and therapists have suggested meds. Im scared they will hurt him. Do you think it's ok for a little guy to be on them?
