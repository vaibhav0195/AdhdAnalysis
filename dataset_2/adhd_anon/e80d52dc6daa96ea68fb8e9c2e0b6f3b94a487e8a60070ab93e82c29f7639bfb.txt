But I have also met a lot of others with the same condition and atleast a 3rd seemed to have the exact same thing I have. And some of them were just complete assholes. But blamed it on adhd. I have noticed more people at my age, 23 still using the same excuse.   Anyways my point is, I feel a lot of people who have adhd, who are also shit heads blame their adhd for it. Honestly you can be a good person and it's not hard to make changes within yourself. Adhd isn't preventing you from doing good things. Some people make life worse because they think it goes deeper than it really does.
