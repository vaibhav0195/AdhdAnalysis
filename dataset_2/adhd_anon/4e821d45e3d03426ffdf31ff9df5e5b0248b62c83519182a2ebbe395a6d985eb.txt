4e821d45e3d03426ffdf31ff9df5e5b0248b62c83519182a2ebbe395a6d985eb;;;Ran Out of meds and my doctors office is closed until Monday. Any alternatives work (vitamins, caffeine pills) that might help me get through.  ;;;Hello all,   First of all, this is a great and very helpful subreddit.  Next, hopefully this is the best place for this post.  I called my doctor to get my script written since he writes it for one month and I need to pick it up from the doctors office which is a city away ( live in Michigan but might be a national law since its a controlled substance ).  Turns out he is out for the entire week.  I've wanted to go to a different doctor in town but I haven't been diagnosed with ADD per se I just know that Ritalin has save my engagement and has landed me a great job in my field.  Now that I'm without meds for 6 days, is there anything I can do to help?  Will the pharmacy fill my script for a few days to tide me over?  Would I need to see another doctor?  Should I just make due and tide my brain with caffeine and vitamins?  Any help would be greatly appreciated. Important weekend as I'm the best man in my cousins wedding.  Thank you for your time.  Edit: Credit to my past self for saving Ritalin that made me jittery and occasionally nauseated.(Of course more karma to the people that posted helpful  suggestions! :) ).  Not anything I would take for an extended period of time but I plan on spacing out what little I have left and just making sure if it causes any side effects to stop and only take what is needed.
