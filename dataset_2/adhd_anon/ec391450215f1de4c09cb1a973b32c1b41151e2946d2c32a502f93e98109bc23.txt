(I'm in college now.) I'm currently prescribed 36mg of Concerta daily. Recently, I've had to have a physical with health services to get medically cleared for athletics. BUT, since I've been in college and on the concerta, my blood pressure has been on the high end of normal. I've never had blood pressure problems before and when I checked it at home over break, I was at low normal.  Are there any other medications out there that might help? And how would these vary from the concerta/Ritalin routine?
