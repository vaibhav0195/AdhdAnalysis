I've noticed mouth dryness, shakiness, a weird feeling in my teeth/gums, and decreased appetite.  I've been drinking coconut water for more electrolytes, flossing/brushing more(still have a bad taste in my mouth), and trying to eat healthy small meals.   I've heard stories about hair loss, skin aging, and teeth problems and they scare me! I'm a 29 year old female and don't want to be smelly breathed and wrinkled lol.   I figured since I just started I should ask those of you with more experience. Thanks in advance. And it is helping a ton, just want to avoid the bad stuff.   Edit: I totally understand everyone is different but I'd love your advice either way.
