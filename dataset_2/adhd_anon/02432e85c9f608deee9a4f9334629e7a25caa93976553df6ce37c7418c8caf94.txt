After sticking with my music hobby for 3 years I finally made my first music video;;;Sorry this is a bit long.  About 3 years ago I started listening to rap. It was good so I started making songs.  For almost 3 years, there was always an excuse to not make music. I didn't have the money to buy a microphone. I didn't have the time to get a job to make money because it took me forever to do my homework.   3 months ago I got diagnosed with ADHD and started taking Vyvanse. My grades jumped a letter grade and I only had to do about half as much work. So now I have a few hours a day. I'm spending about 40 hours a week playing Grand Theft Auto and some other video games, feeling like I'm wasting my life. I need to change something.  When I got diagnosed, the doctor told me about how my verbal intelligence was so much better than my ability to focus, that I would be able to do anything language-related- IF I really wanted to.  I took this as a sign that I should start taking music seriously.  1 month later, I decided to finally do what I have been putting off for years- getting a proper setup and learning how to record. My mom was very surprised that I actually took the time to do something (she has not exactly been supportive of my creative pursuits- in fact, she will often tell me about how stupid I am for wasting my time with music).   2 days ago, I had finished a song- the first song I am truly proud of- and I decided I needed to make a music video.  I am sure a lot of you have heard about how people with ADHD are more creative. So I was reading about how people usually make music videos. They hire:  1) A director  2) An assistant director  3) A lighting FX guy  4) A sound FX guy  Etc., etc.  I thought about this for a while. *How am I going to make a good music video for free?* I was quite perplexed for a while.  Then I realized. I can just put my phone camera right up against my alarm clock and hit the record button.  **So to say to all of you who have just gotten diagnosed, or feel like you're worthless, or you are "too stupid" to do X, or you can't focus long enough to do Y, you're not. You will reach your dreams. It will take time. But you and your goals are worth it.**  What else did I learn from this?  **If not for my ADHD-style idea bouncing, I would have never come up with a nearly as impressive music video.**  **TL;DR you'll get where you want to go.**  [Video in case you want to see what my ADHD mind thinks like and as a reward for you getting this far] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0LTpEhAR3k&amp;t=9s)
