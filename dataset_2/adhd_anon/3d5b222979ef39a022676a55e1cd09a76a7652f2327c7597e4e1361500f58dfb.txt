3d5b222979ef39a022676a55e1cd09a76a7652f2327c7597e4e1361500f58dfb;;;So I for to take my night pills for sleeping...;;;and it was horrible. I couldn't sleep for hours, my head was racing with thoughts, I could hear my own blood flow racing through my head, I started having conversations with myself in english though I'm not a native english-speaker. My boyfriend went to sleep at 2:30am and woke me up. I had to take the f... pill at almost 3am because I was afraid that I couldn't get some hours of sleep and I had to go to work this morning. I ended waking up two hours later than I usually do and arriving "late", thanks to all gods my work has a flexible worktime and that is not a problem for them but today I need to work late. I need to go shopping after work because we barely have food or drinks at home and I don't wan't to. I don't know if I'd be able to sleep early today or not...  Today is going to be a really loooooooooooooong day. It sucks to be us sometimes.  TL;DR: Didn't take night pills and today I'm going to suffer the consequences.
