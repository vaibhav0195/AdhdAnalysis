c9457c6133ef28aed6e22309913a07a125c2ddb81c395ef5d997fad094113dc0;;;ADHD and relationships;;;I'm new to this subreddit, and glad I discovered it. 25 M here, diagnosed at 16 with ADHD, auditory/visual processing disorder, and generalized anxiety. I'm happy to report I have a great job, supportive family and girlfriend.   However, I've been having issues with my relationships lately and I suspect that ADHD and my other learning disabilities may play a role in my behavior. I sometimes feel that I have missed certain social cues that everyone else has managed to pick up on. I was wondering if anyone else has had similar issues, or may have general advice or resources.   To simplify, I will break down my observations into a few bullets, and I hope others can relate.   *I find myself much more careful around people I don't know well. I'm more reserved and tend to be shy and mask my true personality. But, as I get closer to people, I find myself being comfortable and I let my guard down. Here, I become more socially unaware. I say things that are unintentionally hurtful, thoughtless, stupid, or embarrassing. I hate the cycle, and it causes me to distance myself from others to avoid the embarrassment.   *I seem to have trouble with intimacy and romance. I feel love, but I seem to be unaware of how little I show it. I often forget or miss something that would otherwise be thoughtful. It's as if I need to make a "to do" list of how to be a good boyfriend.   *It takes a long time to adjust to from one social situation to another. If conversation quickly changes topic or emotion, I seem to have trouble keeping up. For example, moving from a joke to a serious discussion, or moving from a confrontation to a resolution.   **TL;DR New to this subreddit, mid-20s guy who feels that ADHD/LD/anxiety has negatively affected his ability to socialize and maintain relationships and would like some general advice or resources in this area.**
