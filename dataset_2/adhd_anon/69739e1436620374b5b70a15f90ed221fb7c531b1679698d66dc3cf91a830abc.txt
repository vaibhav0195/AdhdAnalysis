But I could hardly focus in class or do anything except sports. That was the main thing I can excel at. I was on Ritalin as a kid and they took me off of it when I was 12.  But now that my professional sports dream is down the drain and I am going to school while working in the "real world" I am struggling.  School is not hard but my organization sucks and I daydream while listening to lectures.  I feel unmotivated and depressed. I isolate myself from others(mother says I am just an introvert but thats not the case. I like being around people I am comfortable with.)    My mother says that "I am over it"  which I think is completely untrue.  In the military I struggled with remembering daily tasks and what not.  So I am thinking about getting reexamined  by someone in the VA (Lets see how long that takes lol) so that I may see what treatment I need. I am also thinking of getting CT scan of my brain. I have been having pretty bad headaches since the military and I think I need to get checked out.  What do you think?
