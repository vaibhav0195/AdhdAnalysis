I now have a new set of  questions. I am highly enjoying how productive and focused i have been but I have a worry that I might build a tolerance too this. So I have 3 questions! 1. How long before my body begins to adapt and build a tolerance? 2. How do I prevent my body from building the tolerance? and 3. If I do build a tolerance how do I basically reset?
