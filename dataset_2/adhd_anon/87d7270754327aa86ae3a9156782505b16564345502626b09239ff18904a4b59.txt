Doctor covering for him responded tomee and after I explained for 10 minutes the entire situation, he said "well it sounds like the medicatino is giving you side effects of muscle cramping. You can either stop taking the medicene or try to deal with it"  - WTF? Great job doc. Real great job. - What should I do? - Do we think a different medication like adderall or vyvanse would produce same effects? - Is there a prescription drug or prescription formulation of natural products that could help with cramping?
