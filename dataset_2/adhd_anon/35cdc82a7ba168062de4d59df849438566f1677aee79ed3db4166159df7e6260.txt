35cdc82a7ba168062de4d59df849438566f1677aee79ed3db4166159df7e6260;;;Feelings of hopelessness;;;I am a 26 year old male recently diagnosed with ADHD. I feel like there is no hope for me. I have so far lived an empty and lonely life without accomplishments, filled with self-hatred, cynicism and negativity. At this point I feel that’s what I am destined to be, a bitter &amp; lonely man who will never amount to anything. I wish I could be positive and happy but when your life has only consisted of failures it seems logical that you become bitter, maybe it’s just a bad excuse. I have never been able to finish things I started. For the second time I’m about to flunk out of university. I spend most my days procrastinating and playing video games as a form of escapism. When I compare myself to my friends at the same age I got nothing to show for. While they have girlfriends, apartments/houses and well-paying jobs I’m stuck in a downward spiral, having to struggle for rent and food.  It’s not like I’m contemplating suicide, I just wish I could see the light at the end of the tunnel. At the moment everything feels hopeless and every attempt I make seems futile and the motivation to even try is long gone. I don’t really know where I’m going with all this. I guess it just feels good to write my thoughts down.
