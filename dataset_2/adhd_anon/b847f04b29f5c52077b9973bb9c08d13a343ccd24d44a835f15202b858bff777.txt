Presently I only use it when I anticipate a task which requires a large amount of concentration. When I use it I do notice substantial increases to my ability to concentrate on my tasks. But often I have problems with the side-effects: most notably an increased heart rate, which makes me feel anxious, and a reduced appetite, which Im not too bothered by, as well as a dry throat.   I have been looking online about the symptoms and side-effects of ritalin/adderall use amongst both normal people and people suffering from ADHD. I was asking myself that if it helped me concentrate, why not normal people? Apparently, many students do think this as well. But then the articles go on to say that the effects can be harmful, most notably leading to heart problems.   Then I'm thinking, why do ADD users get this drug prescribed on such a massive scale if it is known to lead to heart problems? Articles on other similar drugs say that this type of drugs (Amfetamines) improve performance, but at a costly price.    My question is really, as a sufferer of ADD, what is this price to me? Do I also have an increased chance of heart problems (Being an otherwise healthy person, you know: Balanced diet, regular exercise, etc)? Would it be better to look for alternative ways of dealing with my concentration problems and abandon medicinal treatment altogether?
