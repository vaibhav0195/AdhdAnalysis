1ff223a9af248beb31b3285fed15e8f428dbcbeb2bb377f1e62cdd3ef094bebb;;;Before and after medications;;;So, here's the deal. All my life, I've been kinda flaky/flighty. Shrugged off homework, ditched plans with friends, etc. My parents and teachers always attributed it to my intelligence, and as they were essentially calling me smart, I went with it.  But, in recent years, I've started to suspect it was ADHD. I've had problems with several drugs, all of which I ended up just walking away from for a new crutch. My mind never stops moving, even when I'm trying to sleep. It also just kind of wanders, often pondering random things that nobody would ever care about, but which amused me in the moment. I haven't been able to hold a job for long, and whenever I get paid, I tend to spend it on shit I don't need; I just say fuck it and buy stuff. I'm divorced at 22, and none of my other relationships have lasted long.  Anyways, I ramble. I'm going in to get it diagnosed Monday morning, and while I'll let the doctors worry about whether I have it or not, my question is, did you feel any different after starting treatment? Like, did you look at things differently, or have a different thought process or anything?
