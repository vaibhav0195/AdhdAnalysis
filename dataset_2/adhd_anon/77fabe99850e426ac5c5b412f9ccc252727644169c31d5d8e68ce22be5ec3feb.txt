Adderall is my "miracle drug".   It hits me fast. The sky is blue, the sun is warm, the birds are chirping. I feel perfect.   My social anxiety is nowhere to be found. I am finally able to be myself without feeling ashamed.  Studying is not only effortless, but *fun*, because I love learning deep down but hate the struggle.   I have no anxiety over possible failure; I feel capable. I feel peace. I can relax.   I feel the connectedness and empathy for humankind that has been missing all my life. I love the person I see in the mirror.   My to-do list is scribbled off and tossed out of the way before dinnertime. I have no side effects; I eat, I sleep, I don't crash. I am myself, potential unlocked.  **But**...I've been keeping myself on Ritalin since getting pseudo-diagnosed this past spring. It clears away the weeds in my mind to let me do what I need to do, but it's still up to me to do it. I don't have the drive. I don't eat. IR gives me chaotic ups and downs; XR keeps me up all night. Half the time, the only indicator I've taken it is a pounding heart and a restless body.  I tell my doctor "well, it's better than nothing", and walk out with a prescription for 90 more 10mgs once a month. I've been complacent with this.  Why?   **I fear addiction**. It's as if my brain was a specially made lock for which Adderall is the only key. As if I were wired to just *fucking love it*. I keep my supply an armslength away at all times and have to keep complete self-control. I trust myself with anything else (ex: the 30-day supply of Oxycodone and the 2 weeks' worth of Xanax still sitting in my medicine cabinet, untouched in months), but Adderall is...too good.  Just a little too much Ritalin gives me heart palpitations, an antsy stomach, and cold sweats. I've learned my lesson there. Having 90 at my disposal to disperse throughout the month isn't dangerous.  Even moreso, I **fear losing my panic switch**. Just knowing that there's a drug out there that can make me exactly who I want to be is the most comforting thought in the world. I feel incredibly lucky that such a drug exists. I know that if life suddenly becomes overwhelming, and I managed to put off that paper for three weeks, I can bang it out in a few hours and do an amazing job while having a great time. I know that if I fall behind, I can catch up. This fact relieves more anxiety than you can imagine.  I don't care about the "high". I care about the impact that my very occasional use has on my life.  If I take it daily or near-daily, and those effects are eventually diminished or lost, what do I have left to get me through those god-awful days where I just can't get my shit together? Even using it every other day, I feel the drop-off. What do I have to fall back on when my own determination and brute strength isn't enough? I love knowing that one 30mg pill can be divided up into three "panic switches" to have on hand, just in case.  I know Adderall is perfect, and that's why I stay away from it. But, does that even make any sense?

I had hope during a time that was my most challenging yet, thanks to this damn pre-vet undergrad boot camp of a class list. I got my first prescription for Concerta after midterms had me strung out to what I thought was my breaking point.  I was dealing with what is notoriously one of the toughest courses at my school (Zoology), that dreaded "weed out" class with the cold, stoic professor that breaks down even the most hopeful, put-together 4.0 student. I put in at least six hours every single day for that class alone. I sacrificed my Trig grade and can no longer say the lowest grade I've ever received in college is a B. I'd heard rumors that *no one* gets an A in the class, and you have to be a genius to even hope for a B.  I gave it every single drop of perseverance I had left. I was going to fucking *own* this class and show up that professor who made me feel like stupid, incompetent scum every day that I saw her. I was going to crawl on my hands and knees through her own shit just to prove that I was dedicated.  I walked away from the first exam tired, but feeling good. It came back as a 77. I was already giving it my all. I had to ask, "How much more do I have to give?". I didn't think. I set out to find out.  I spent hour after hour reading that boring-ass book even though it took me half the day to read 10 pages. I made diagrams, I made charts that I couldn't even reach to hang up on my wall due to their size, I made over 1300 e-flashcards, I made supernotes of my supernotes and led multiple 9+ hour hardcore study sessions with my classmates. Preparing for the final was like training for a marathon, but I was in it, and backing down wasn't an option.  I got a B.  When it was all said and done, I cried my first tears of joy in months. I felt traumatized, battered, exhausted. I literally did not know what to do with my free time, and was still too tense to enjoy the new warmth of spring. I still walked away with the worst semester GPA I can claim for my entire college career. I walked away with an overall GPA down 0.27 points, barely competitive for vet school.  It was a huge fucking achievement, and I felt awesome about it on some level. Five months later, I can still probably rattle off taxonomy and anatomy as well as the day before the final.  I was supposed to take a summer class or two, to make up for those credits I lost while transferring. Come time to register, I recoiled. I was still too burnt out. I needed more time.  I was supposed to go back to school the Thursday before classes started, but I hesitated. I was still too burnt out. I needed more time. I got fully settled in to my new room the night before my first 8am class.  And here I sit, about 5 weeks later, still guarded, anxious, and tense, like a war vet with PTSD. Last semester, I had a drive, I had a spark in me that let me appreciate the little miracles in life so that I could cultivate genuine interest in the most boring aspects of the classes that drove me crazy. I got by on those little wins, that hour or two of free time I might find at the tail end of the night, those little bits of rare information that made me stop and think, "Damn, life is complex and awesome".  Now, I open a book, and see thousands of words mocking me. "You're so smart and capable when you apply yourself, but you can't. Sucks for you!" My reading comprehension is worse than it has ever been despite me feeling the Ritalin still kicking in strongly. I might as well be reading hieroglyphics, unless I slow down enough to read a sentence six times over and think about it in-depth, which I don't have time to do.  ...Until I'm reading something genuinely interesting, in which case I will fly through it, crave more, and tell everyone I know about what I read, whether they care or not.  Now, when I hit a paragraph full of things that will be a serious challenge to understand, I panic. My first instinct is to slam the book shut and go dive under the covers for comfort. I'm still so traumatized from that Zoology class that my brain shuts down the moment it has any indication that failure is inevitable no matter the effort.   My poor brain has been so conditioned over time to believe that no effort can bring the rewards it seeks. For so long, that idea was driven into it by teachers, parents, professors, and anyone else that could get a critical word in. It had no idea that it had a legitimate disorder and wasn't just stupid. It took me *years* to coddle it, gently show it how to *learn* again and be creative and use itself for better things, to regrow that sense of self-assuredness and blossom, even if it's late in the growing season.  And now, all I can think about when I turn the page and see some massive and complex diagram of some metabolic pathway with all the different molecules coming in and out and the chapter-long explanation with all of the molecule names and functions and structure, is...  "*Iamgoingtohavetotrysohard, thisisgoingtotakesomuchoutofme, I'malreadyrunintotheground, howmuchlongercanIkeepthisup, willthisbetheclassthatruinsme, nowaitIgotthisfar, Icanfinishthis, butatwhatcost, I'msofuckingtired, I'msofuckingoverwhelmed, Ishouldgodoanythingelse, nowaitI'lljusttryandparaphrasethis, I'm2sentencesinandIneedabreak, ifItakeanymorebreakstodayI'llgetnothingdone, it'sprobablynotashardasitlooks, ohnowaititISashardasitlooks...*"   And back and forth I go, fighting myself for some tiny shred of motivation. Finding none. Picking up whatever scraps I can find and running with them. Trying to drive 100 miles on a gas gauge reading "E". Flopping into bed after only getting halfway there, burnt out. Waking up an hour early just to lay in bed and feel the warmth, dreading what I have to do that day.  I spent every spare moment of the last week writing what I thought was the most bulletproof, well-written research grant proposal for a study I've been dying to get working on. I wrote it all by myself, taking it head-on with a rare bit of enthusiasm I managed to scrape together, even though it was a group assignment. I got a grade of a low C back earlier today, every page looking like a murder scene with all the red ink. Half of the "mistakes" were through no fault of my own.  But I push on, even though my attitude of "bad grade? Take that anger and make it determination to prove you're fucking brilliant at the next opportunity" is wearing thin.  Just 2 1/2 more years of this, I tell myself. Just 2 1/2 more years, and then I can *maybe* worm my way into the 4 more years that will *actually* tear me apart, in hopes of finally doing the only thing I've wanted to do my whole life.  It's only week 4 of 16. Here's to hoping that I find that spark somewhere along the way, and soon.  My ADHD college peers, we really have the odds stacked against us, don't we? Shit's crazy, but we're still at it. Here's to not giving up, even when we're looking at rock bottom from below.
