That people are boring to you. That you feel like an outsider.  As a non ADHD person, how do I keep your attention enough so that we can have an active friendship?      Edit: Okay - thank you everyone. My honest feedback is that:      * I've epically failed a new friend. I think I did every "do not" on your combined lists.  * I am incredibly intimidated by this list, and I will be really self-couscous if we ever hung out together again, trying to do/remember all these things.  * Some of these typical reactions, are the exact same signals used to drop a person from your social circle. For example, never calling. Short brief communications (texts). Disinterest in conversational topics. Not showing up.     So how do I tell the difference between someone with ADHD who is reacting normally, or if they are just not interested in being my friend? (because continuously reaching out in the wrong context would be pretty embarrassing)
