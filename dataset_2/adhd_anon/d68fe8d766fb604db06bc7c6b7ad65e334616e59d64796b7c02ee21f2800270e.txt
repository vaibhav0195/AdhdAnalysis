Based on the quick 1 hour meeting, they believed I had GAD and suggested CBT and also switched me to another psych for this.  I'm still under the belief that I have ADHD and I haven't really seen any purpose to this CBT.  What I'm frustrated with is they changed my medication from Paxil to Wellbutrin.  This seems like they are treating ADHD with "might work" (NDRI) instead of diagnosing and treating with "might work with higher success rate" (Stimulants)  If I do not have ADHD then I am fine, but I want my doctor to explain why she believes that.  Is there a series of tests that can definitively take ADHD off the table?  I've run the gambit of SSRIs and SNRIs and can't handle the try (for months) and see method anymore.  So has anyone else been in this position, and did they eventually move from GAD to ADHD?
