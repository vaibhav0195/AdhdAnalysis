39e09e3a68c3655998a32ba745e4a1c5de1711d2a5ec5f7e6f98fbc805a70c90;;;Fellow canadian/quebecois how long does a diagnostic last in the systems ?;;;ok so when I was 13-14 in foster care I was if I remember right diagnosed with ADHD than prescribe Ritalin but than I got back with my parents and they forced me to go off the meds because they were bad for me.  now I'm 25 going on 26 this year and yes I've failed high school and want to try to complete it, my problem is  I would want to see if my diagnostic is still in the system to get back on my meds or get a follow up on my original diagnostic  and see if I can succeed with them.  anyone know if my diagnostic would still be in the system after 10 years and if not where do I need to go to get reevaluated ?
