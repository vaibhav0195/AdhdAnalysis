Maybe this is wrong place to put this, but I thought I might as well see if anyone else with ADHD here shares this.  The issue in question is a general lack of ability to care about my life. If I had an off button, I would have pushed it multiple times over, not because I'm feeling sad or depressed about anything, but just because I don't really have any motivation to continue living in general. I've been raised in a great environment, my parents love me and have provided excellent parenting throughout my life for myself and my siblings, and I honestly don't feel any kind of constant negative emotion (Sure, I'll feel negative emotion towards specific unpleasant scenarios, but my point is it's not a depression.). The few goals I have have nothing to do with any sort of self sustaining lifestyle, and even those fade after a short time of separating myself from the environment that briefly stimulated them.  At this point I'm fairly certain that I wouldn't even do anything if I were forced to provide for myself. Obviously this kind of neutrality isn't normal, so I'm wondering if this has been a problem for anyone. I've been on vyvanse for two weeks now (started on 20mg, went up by 10mg every three days until I hit 50 and am staying on that for a month), but although I noticed somewhat of a boost in ability to hold onto focus, it seems to be fading already. Even when I was noticing a difference, it was only for 5 hours or so each day. Right now it just seems like a big Catch-22; I need motivation to get motivation, so the only option I really see is waiting for some combination of meds to work.  TL;DR - Can't give a fuck. Has anybody else had this issue like this/how'd you deal with it?
