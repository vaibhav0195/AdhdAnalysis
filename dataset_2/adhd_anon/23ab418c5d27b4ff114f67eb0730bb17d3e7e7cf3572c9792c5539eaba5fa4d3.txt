Help?!;;;As the title says, I was diagnosed with ADHD halfway through my second year of university. My GPA is low, just under 2.0, and most grad school programs want a 3.0 GPA, either overall or for the last two years. Has anyone around here been through something similar? I mean, this semester is going fantastically, but I don't know if even this rate will get me to where I need for grad school. I'm resigned to taking an extra semester or two of classes, but is this realistic at all?
