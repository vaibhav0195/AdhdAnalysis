My brother AND my sister were diagnosed as children with ADHD. They exhibited many of the hyperactivity symptoms. But me, I was not "hyper" so I believe that I was overlooked although I have many of the symptoms of ADD.   A few years ago, I went to either a psychologist or psychiatrist in a different state that I live in ( used to live in Louisiana, now in Georgia). He basically dismissed my concerns and said if i wasn't diagnosed as a child, I wont be diagnosed as an adult. That rejection has caused me to feel pretty hopeless in getting help for something I am pretty convinced I have.   Is it commonly a struggle to have a doctor take your concerns seriously? Now that I am in a new state, I want to try to go to a doctor again, but I thought I would ask how have others who were diagnosed as adults what they did to have their doctors to agree that there is such thing as ADD/ADHD and help get the diagnosis?
