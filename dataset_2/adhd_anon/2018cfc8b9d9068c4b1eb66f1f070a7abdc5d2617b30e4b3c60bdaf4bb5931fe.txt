Now I'm 25, in school for photography, and feeling incredibly overwhelmed recently so I've decided to finally use the disability services to ask for help. Problem is, I'm not sure what to ask for. I'm currently in 4 lab classes, and I never really had issues testing even if I did have lecture classes right now, so that rules out testing accommodations. What else is there?  Oh, and if it helps, my biggest issues are feeling overwhelmed and executive dysfunction, and my anxiety/depression/social phobia also.
