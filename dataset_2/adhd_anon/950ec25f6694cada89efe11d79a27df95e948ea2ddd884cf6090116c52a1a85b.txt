Unfortunately it's in the middle of a semester, and I have **not** done well so far.  I had to drop a relatively easy gen. ed. required class because I failed every exam no matter how much I studied, I am doing poorly in a lab course where the average grade is an A, and I'm on the verge of failing organic chemistry.  I'm currently in the process of getting a disability accommodation for my ADHD (I have some already for my Type 1 Diabetes, which I tend not to use because I don't need them for my Diabetes). I'm really hoping when I give letters to my professors they are understanding and may potentially give me extra assignments to bring up my grades. But I'm also nervous my professors will dismiss me completely and only comply with the university mandated accommodations.   I'm wondering what I can expect in terms of accommodations, and if you guys have any experience in a similar situation? Bonus points if any of you have applied to professional or grad schools and how lenient they may be when ADHD affected grades (I'm a first semester junior *still* aiming for Vet school with a gpa lower than 3.0)  TL;DR I was diagnosed with ADHD in the middle of a semester, getting horrible grades and about to register with the disability office, but am also wondering if my professors will be willing to allow me to improve my grades before finals.
