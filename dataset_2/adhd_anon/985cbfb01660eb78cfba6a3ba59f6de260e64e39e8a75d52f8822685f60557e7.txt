985cbfb01660eb78cfba6a3ba59f6de260e64e39e8a75d52f8822685f60557e7;;;Finding a doctor;;;i am having a difficult time finding a therapist in the Washington D.C. area.  I am looking for someone that can affect change and who is well versed in adult adhd vs. someone to prescribe medication.  I have gone that route but need someone that understands medication, dosages, and therapies to manage ADHD in adults (late diagnosis with the reprecussions that it embodies)  but I am having difficulty finding someone online.  Any advise or recommendations? thanks in advance.
