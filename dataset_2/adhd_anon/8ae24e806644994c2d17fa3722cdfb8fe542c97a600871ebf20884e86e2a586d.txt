I left my doctor's office today with what I understood to be a 90-day prescription for my medication. She handed me three separate pages with concurrent dates, and said that I needed to give them all to my pharmacist in order to receive the 90-day price.   My wife and I have a strict budget, and it's important to make sure that my medication fits in that budget. Simple request, I would imagine.  When I head to the same pharmacy that filled my last prescription, I'm told that it will be $300, which is ***not*** what I discussed or researched with my doctor.   Lo and behold, she wasn't using my pharmacy insurance (which I handed her) to find the price and instead was giving me something else.  She tells me that they cannot hold each prescription and they cannot fill the 90-day version on this series of scrips and that my doctor needs to re-write it. She tells me the (now corrected) price of the 90-day and the 30-day versions and asks if I want her to fill the 30-day.  Doc says she can't write it like that, and to just use one at a time. Fine, whatever. This price still works, just not as planned. We can shift things around.  When I return to this pharmacy, I deal with another tech to whom I hand one month's worth and my prescription insurance card. She sets the card down without looking at it and walks over to another tech saying "Do we have this? Do we have this adderall?" rather loudly.  After receiving confirmation, she comes back and says    "We'll have it done in an hour."     So I reply:    "Yeah, I have work soon, so I'll come by after I get off, since you'll still be open."    Which prompts:     "It'll be *ready* in an **hour**."    So I repeated myself and thanked her, then asked to confirm the price I spoke about earlier, since apparently my insurance card didn't remain on file, and I get:  "She told you the price earlier."  "Right but there was a mistake earlier, I just want to make sure we get it right so I can afford -"  "The price will be $XX.XX."  I thanked her and as I walked away I could hear her talking under her breath, but I couldn't make it out and I needed to be at work. Been steaming all day thinking about it. Next month I'm finding a different pharmacy.  ---------------------   #TL;DR: I love dealing with bitchy people while trying to get my medicine.
