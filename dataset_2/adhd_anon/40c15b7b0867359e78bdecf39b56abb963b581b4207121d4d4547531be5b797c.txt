I've been taking 20mg and I do notice some difference. I probably wouldn't have if it wasn't because I didn't know how other people felt and would still be thinking that it wasn't working for me. I think I'll keep taking them for a while, and see how it goes. Thanks again, you guys are great!  I've been prescribed 10 mg. It literally did nothing for me. I took it for about a 10 days and I just said fuck it, and took 2 to see if a larger dose would make a difference. I *might* feel some difference, but really, nothing like other people report. No extra motivation, no imnsomnia (I've actually taken a nap about 2 hours after I'd taken it), not even side effects (appetite lost, that "coming down feeling" most people seem to hate so much)..not much of anything; the 20 mg does help me a bit, but honestly nothing like I've read. I told my doctor and he said that I should try it for at least 20 days before we decide on another med. It's my understanding that Ritalin works right away, so, why would he tell me to wait 20 days?. Also he said that if this one doesn't work, we'll try Straterra; I don't have much hope on that one either since it's pretty much the same thing as Ritalin, isn't it? Where I live doctors won't prescribe Adderal, Vyvanese or anything that's an amphetamine. It took me about a year to finally be prescribed Ritalin (tried Wellbutrin before, it improved my mood, but did nothing for my adhd).  So pretty much I'd like to know if anyone around here took Ritalin for a while before it actually started to work?  tl;dr: How long did you take Ritalin for before you decided it was working for you?
