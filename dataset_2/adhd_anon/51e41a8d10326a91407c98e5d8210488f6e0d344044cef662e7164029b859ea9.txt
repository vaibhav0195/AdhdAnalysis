I felt as though I had completely figured out how to cope with this disorder up until a few months ago but I now realize it was because I was touring in a band full time and living a "rock star" life style. At that point my brain had no other choice but to reward me with some dopamine here and there. Long story short, life has slowed down a little for me and my ADHD has come back to haunt me HARD.  I'm going back to school for Graphic Design in the end of January and I think I need to try medication again. I can't even hold a normal conversation with my girlfriend who I love very much so the thought of going back to school is making me think more and more that medication might be a good idea.  I've heard some horror stories about what ADHD medication can do to your creativity so I was wondering if anyone had any stories of ADHD meds helping or hurting your creativity because at this point in my life it's all i feel I really have a hold on.
