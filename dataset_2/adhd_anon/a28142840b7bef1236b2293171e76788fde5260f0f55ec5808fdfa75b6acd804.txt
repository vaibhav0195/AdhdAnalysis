My doctor was pretty unfamiliar with adult ADHD, but willing to work with me. She prescribed me Adderall, 5mg XR, which I've heard is a very small dose. It had minimal effects, mostly on my energy levels and a barely noticeable increase in focus.  She's since bumped me up to 10mg XR. I've been on that for a month, and I've noticed since the first day any effects I felt from the 5mg are gone, and I'm not really noticing much difference at all. I figured I'd give it time to build up in my system to start feeling the effects, but nothing after a month.   I have an appointment next week and I'm not sure whether or not I should ask her about going back down to the 5mg, or maybe increasing my dosage again. She seems to be looking to me for answers as to what dosage I feel comfortable with, so I wanted to do some research.   Has anyone else experienced something like this? Could the effects of the 5mg have been placebo? I've never taken stimulants before and I'm not sure if they usually fluctuate in effectiveness or what, so any insight is appreciated :)
