96dd7ae9dce737188b9ce601e8e0ed196f3665b0fb4bd27ddb85a734fa5056ff;;;I think I may have ADD;;;I have been playing with the idea for a month or two now, and it just makes so much sense to me.  I have had trouble in school in the past, and that is my main concern as I am currently back in college.  If I try to sit down and study, I can read maybe a single page out of my reading before my mind starts to wander, and then a few minutes later I realize I don't even remember what I read.  It is the most frustrating thing I have ever experienced.  Sometimes I forgot important things that my girlfriend wants me to remember, and that sucks. I used to study for 10 hours on a single subject and not be able to finish my online homework.  I feel like there are just thoughts that don't stop popping into my head among other things.  I feel that a diagnosis would first get me some relief in knowing that what I have tried to do for years is not fully my fault when I try so hard.  Is there any advice that you guys might have for me?  I am going to be calling my local medical center to set up an appointment, but it even feels nerve-racking just doing this.
