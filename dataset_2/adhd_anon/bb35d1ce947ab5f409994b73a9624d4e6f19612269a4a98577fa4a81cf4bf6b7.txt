I'm 22 now, in my first semester of nursing school. Studying with add is hard but I'm disciplined enough. It's the clinicals that are getting me messed up. It's hard to understand all the directions the instructor is giving. I keep making mistakes because I didn't follow directions. Sometimes I didn't even hear her say something because I got distracted by my own thought. Sometimes she'll say something and I cling on to what she said and totally miss out out what she's saying after. It's becoming a big problem and I will be written up if I mess up clinical again. I'm seeing my doctor tomorrow to talk about my adhd. What can I do right now to help my problem? What drugs work best? What techniques help to follow and listen to verbal instructions? How do I use add meds? What are the side effects?
