The thing is that I haven't made any progress the last few months and that is killing my spirit. I use ritalin on a schedule and I have an app for that. That is going great. The rest of my daily routine, yeah...  I need to sleep more but I think quite a few can recognise the fact that it has magically become 2am. Besides that eating regularly is a real struggle, I LOVE to cook but I just don`t have the structure to actually do that often enough. There is many more things related to my daily schedule that I am not happy with but I think you get the picture.   I have managed a few times to have a good schedule but after about a week I drop out it and it is just so hard to get back in.   Do you guys have any tips on how to create a daily schedule and how to stick to that?(for longer than a week)   I study computer science so tips on apps to use/website are also very welcome.  I finally found the energy and motivation to start working on myself again and become a little happier, step by step I will manage but a small push in the right direction could be very useful.  Thanks in advance, you guys already have given me so much inspiration just browsing this subreddit :)
