About a year ago I decided enough was enough and came off all meds. Since then, I have felt a lot better but my ADHD has worsened. I am wary of going back to the Doctor's office but I really need to get this under control. Life is falling to pieces. I am not looking forward to the meds game where "let's try this one" is said at every visit. I guess I'm looking for input on what works best or things I can try before drugs.

I figured out that I am allergic to Nuvigil and quit taking it immediately (per Doc's orders). I had previously started Wellbutrin and it kicked in this week! Man does it make a difference!     We have been "planning" a trip to my in-laws. I have never been good at pulling this sort of thing together in a timely manner. This week started off tough but I have really pulled it together. I accomplished tons of stuff on my to-do lists and managed to get the kids back in school with everything they needed (big win!). I got my van cleaned out and the fluids checked, got the laundry done, packed, even dealt with a lice scare and all before we needed to leave. Usually I am scrambling to pack at the last second and end up leaving hours late or not at all. This time I got everything done in time to take a minute to sit down and write this! I just needed to share how awesome I feel! My husband is oozing pride and that is the most awesome thing ever! Well, got to go! Have a great Labor day weekend! TLTR: I got everything done for our trip in time to relax and share this huge win with y'all! The best feeling ever!
