My fianc√©e knows, my parents know and my boss knows. That's it. It's not that I'm ashamed. It's that I don't want to feel like I'm making excuses for who am and the flaws I have; I also feel like people won't understand and may dismiss it. Is there anyone else that keeps their condition to themselves?
