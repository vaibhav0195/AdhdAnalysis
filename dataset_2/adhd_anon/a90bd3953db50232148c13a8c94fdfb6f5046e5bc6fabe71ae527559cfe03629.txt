a90bd3953db50232148c13a8c94fdfb6f5046e5bc6fabe71ae527559cfe03629;;;anyone else?;;;alright so I was diagnosed with ADHD I guess as a child, my parents, mom/dad whoever had me on medication's practically all my life (untill the age of 18 where I said I was not going to take them anymore) I'm also left handed :D, anyways I'm somewhat disapointed a little in how things are? I'm a very energetic young man who likes to have ALLOT! of fun, i.e. it is quite hard to maintain a job, and some other things.. wich I have not yet expereienced... also in advanced feel free to spell check me because I'm not googleing any words for I dont really care XD (quite the good speller/talker when I want to be... or whatever) the reason why is because I like to talk, I talk allot and try to make people my friends while also doing my job.. but everyone likes 2 have a problem with me, wich is fine but gets quite anoying when you have to find a new job every 3-4 months because you cant hold a job down (currently 21 and have had no more then 5-6 jobs, current is mc.donalds), I honestly really dont know right now haha, but I was just wondering if anyone else get haters for doing you.. I Guess! meh whatever just a random rant I sapose  OH also! what is a throwaway account?
