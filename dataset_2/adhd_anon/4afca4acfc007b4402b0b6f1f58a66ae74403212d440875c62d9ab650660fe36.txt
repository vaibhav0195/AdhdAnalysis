4afca4acfc007b4402b0b6f1f58a66ae74403212d440875c62d9ab650660fe36;;;30 Male recently diagnosed with ADHD and seeking for inspirational stories;;;Hi I recently got a diagnosis and I will most probably take medicine very soon.   While I recently worked very hard to get the habit of training regularly ( https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine ), eating very well, running and sleeping 8 hours a day, I still feel that I am not ready to become who I would like to become.  I am in my thirties and I am ashamed to say that I have not achieved much. I did start many things, but I am still working in a shitty minimum wage job that I hate and I cannot concentrate in order to learn about my world. I don't really understand economics, my history is lacking, I don't get science... I know a little bit of everything here and there, but nothing that allows me to understand the world the way I'd like to understand it; it frustrates me very much.  I never really did simple tasks like paying bills on time, doing my taxes... I am a mess.  My question is the following. Is there hope for me? Is it possible to become someone I like with so much bad habits? I feel powerless and I see this diagnosis as a possible salvation to get me out of my torpor. Am I too old to become more educated, to have a job that I like and am proud of?  Any similar real life stories would greatly inspire me.
