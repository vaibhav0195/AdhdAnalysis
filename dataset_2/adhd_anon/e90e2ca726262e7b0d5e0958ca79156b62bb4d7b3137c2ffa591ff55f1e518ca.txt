I brought up getting tested once to my mom in high school, but she told me that nothing would actually change by getting diagnosed, so I let the matter drop. Looking back I'm wondering if she either didn't believe me or was worried about the medication. I've dealt with it in my own ways over the years, but it's getting to the point where I feel like it's interfering with my life. I can't finish any projects I've started, I feel frustrated and restless, hell, I can't even keep my room clean for more than a day. My question is, is it worth it to go through all of that to get a diagnosis?
