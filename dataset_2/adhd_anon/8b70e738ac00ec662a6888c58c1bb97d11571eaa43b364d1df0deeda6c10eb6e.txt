I have ADHD, OCD, and BP1. I basically haven't consistently exercised since the age of 19. I'm not overweight, but I feel terrible, and I want to exercise, but when I do, I either injure myself, or get scared that I'm going to injure myself, and so I don't.  Main impediment to lifting weights is an injured oblique I obtained from squatting in 2013. Main impediment to running is an injured menisci on left leg.  Also, I'm worried my heart is going to explode with exercise in addition to my meds (50 mg Vyvanse). I have this stupid obsession that I have some undiagnosed heart problem, and it fucks with me to the point where I feel de-motivated to exercise, which, if I really do have said undiagnosed heart problem, is probably making it worse.  tl;dr How do I go from couch potato to consistent exerciser?
