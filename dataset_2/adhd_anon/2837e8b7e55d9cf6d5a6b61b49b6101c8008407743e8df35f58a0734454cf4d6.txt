I was generally discharged from the Air Force about three years ago, attempted a job in the same field I was doing while serving - Nondestructive Inspection. I failed at that and was fired, so now I'm in college. My wife and mother-in-law persuaded me to get tested for ADHD, so I did. Was diagnosed with anxiety and ADHD, so that's exciting.   Now I feel like I'm drowning; I've tried Ritalin, Adderall, and Straterra. The latter two seemed to work in their own ways, I was more attentive and less spaced out and everything seemed to be more manageable...   Until recently I feel like my life has fallen apart, though. I failed all four of my classes last semester, was fired from my job at the beginning of the semester and have yet to find another job... I'm not sure why it's taking so long to actually get a new one... My marriage is gradually degrading - my wife and I are constantly at one another's throats and we have steadily had less sex, it's been three weeks compared to the typical once a week deal...   Now everything is worse than before... I'm finding it impossible to get anything done and I'm not sure what to do to make it better, I don't mean to be this way... My wife swears I have to do something because she can't deal with this forever and she's afraid that when we have kids they'll be like me... My school is giving me a grace semester to get my GPA up, but my wife isn't sure if I should even bother. The college also says I owe 1500 bucks for not attending classes....  TLDR - my life is a mess and I'm making it worse. I'm not sure what I should do and I wish everything wasn't such a clusterfuck.
