On paper this is the perfect solution for me since I find the tedium and routine of paid employment crashing.   I got my first contract and I made many tiny errors even with the preliminary work I shared with them. Errors they caught and made clear were unacceptable. Well, i started paying closer attention which considerably slowed me down. Add to that that my distractbility went into overdrive last few days and my speed slowed to a crawl. I sought extensions which they reluctantly gave. Missed those new deadlines and have now lost a job. Two weeks wasted. Broke as hell too. I feel worthless.  **TLDR: Freelance work. Cautioned for making easy errors. Slowed down to catch errors. Lost job. Wasted two weeks of life. Enthusiasm for work fading AGAIN. 30 something year old who cant get adulthood right. Feel like shit.**
