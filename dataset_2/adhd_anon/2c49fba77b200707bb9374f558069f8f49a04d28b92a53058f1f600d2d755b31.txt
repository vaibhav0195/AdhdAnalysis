[Norway];;;Now, a bit about my back-story just to cover that: After several visit to the doctor and even an MRI for my pounding tension migraine that's lasted for years, they finally decided to check me for ADD. The results from all the tests are positive, and there's also a lot of things about my growing up that fits pretty much all the signs and symptoms.  So now, at 21, i'm finally seeing a psychologist specialized in ADD/ADHD. But, the thing is: The state (or "statan", as it's commonly called here) has noticed that there are people who sell their medication on the black market, and thus pretty much refuse to give it to adults. I find this extremely unfair, seeing how i have no contact with crime, do no drugs, no tobacco, and even no alcohol.  What they do instead is suggest ways to try and cope with it, but that will take a while and they're not even sure if i'll be able to read a book again. All they can try to do is to reduce my suffering.  So, /r/ADHD, my questions to you: How can this possibly be a good solution? What are your opinions on this? Is it neglect from the health department? (I for one find it incredibly sad that otherwise healthy drugfree youth with their whole lives ahead of them, are refused medicine and a chance to function normally like this.)  (Edit: Another thing that saddens me about it, is that doctors suggested anti depressants for me a bunch of times - but when it's clear what it is i'm being refused any medication. How can they write out anti depressants like it's candy but restrict proper medicine?)
