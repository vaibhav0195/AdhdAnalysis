I'm noticing that around that time of the month (both when it starts and a week beforehand) my anxiety and ADHD seem to get worse (just more that I'll start feeling the symptoms when I normally wouldn't). I'm already aware about the whole "meds are less effective" thing.  In short:  1) Is it normal for my anxiety and ADHD to "ramp up" around that time of the month?   2) How do you manage it when that time comes?  3) I work in a shared office with 3 other people. Would it be more beneficial for me to be working alone around that time of the month (or in general) to ensure that I'm not likely to cause further issues? (I've already found that working somewhere that's not my office tends to increase my productivity). Alternately, any tips for helping this? My coworkers and boss are all aware about my issues (my boss also hired me knowing full well I have anxiety)
