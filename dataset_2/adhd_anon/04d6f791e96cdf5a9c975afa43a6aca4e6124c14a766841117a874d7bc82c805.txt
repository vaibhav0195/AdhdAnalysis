I want to pick something different. I have two options now. I might focus on self-study program, that means I will get certificates and small modules but on same level as Unviersity Bachelor.   Or go to Unviersity Bachelor, but that means there are a lot rules attached to it. Deadlines, classes and so on.  While selfstudy, the rules it is totally up to you and the exam that you have to make, is up to you as well. So you can pick any date that you want and the speed of studying as well.   Anyone here experience similar here? Would love to your stories before I make the decision.   FYI, i just got diagnosed and got ritalin now from this week.
