I took a sleeping pill, took theanine, still took 2 hrs to fall asleep. Extremely disappointed, as it takes like 1 hour to "get going" after waking up and taking medication, it takes like 20 mins at least or 30 to eat breakfast, so i try to get up earlier, becuase time goes by too fast

If so why? I'm looking to switch to Vyvanse in 3-6 months because I really like the idea that I can eat/drink what i want.. Not that I want to go out and consume a ton of acidic stuff, but it'd be nice to not have to consider when to eat or what to eat.  And has your vyvanse made you focus as good as your adderall xr?
