At what age kids are old enough to understand this condition?;;;I'm a 27 yo mother of 2 kids: 4 and 5 years old. I'm gonna bring my youngest to a specialist this summer to diagnosed (or not, but I find he seems to have the same problems I have) if the father gives his autorisation.  I will see a psychiatrist next week for a plan of medication for myself and I've been thinking if I should talk to the kids about this condition. I receive often questions such as "mommy, why you NEVER remember this or that??" Because as a single mother, I ask my kids to remind me some of their stuffs (like I need cream because my skin itshes or where are these exacts toys in the house)  Anyways, I'm not sure if they are old enough but I'd like some experiences from other parents:)
