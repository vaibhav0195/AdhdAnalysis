Its not depression per say. Its just a lack of motivation lethargy and basically not caring enough to want to carry on.  Lately I have been fantasizing about different ways I could die quickly. The though of death has not scared me for a.long while, but this is a different feeling. Yesterday I was driving on a empty road and I had this overwhelming desire to just close my eyes and put my foot down on the gas. I have also been staring down from my office just imagining what would happen if some one pushed me out. There is a big problem of terrorism in my country  and when I see news of bomb blasts killing people I imagine just being there. Just going in a second. No pain . I know its a horrinle though but I envy those people.  do you guys ever go through these wierd phase. Should i be worried. I dont want to discuss this with my doctor as he will think i am suacidal.and put me.back om antidepressents. I hate them and dont want to ever go back.
