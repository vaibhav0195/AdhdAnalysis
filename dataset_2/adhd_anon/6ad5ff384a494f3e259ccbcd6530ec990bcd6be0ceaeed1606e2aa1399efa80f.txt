6ad5ff384a494f3e259ccbcd6530ec990bcd6be0ceaeed1606e2aa1399efa80f;;;Should I see a psychologist or psychiatrist?;;;Okay, so I'm 26 and I was diagnosed with ADHD by my old primary family doctor a few years back.  He gave me a prescription for adderal XR 20 mg twice daily.  It seemed to help a lot for the first year or so I was on it, but within the last year or so, I've been having some issues.    Ive been getting mood swings, and bouts of feeling depressed.  Sometimes its the smallest things that make me tip over the edge.  I always thought that I was good at handling stress and it's just been really tough the past year or so.    Also, I've always been a really social person, and my job relies on me being social, but as of the last few months it's been really hard for me to interact with people, and I feel like I haven't been doing my job as well as I could.  I'm avoiding interacting with people, and it just makes me feel like shit, to be honest.    Anyways, I know I need help, and reading a lot of what you guys go through has really made me open my eyes to how many things that I experience with ADHD that are normal.  I've never actually gone to a psychiatrist for a specific diagnosis or anything.  I'd really just like to talk to someone about things I can do and how my disorder is affecting the things that have been bothering me lately.    What are your experiences with psychiatrists and/or psychologists?  How has it helped you?  Do you have any suggestions for me?  I'm just a little down and lost right now and haven't been feeling myself, so any info would be really helpful.  Thank you
