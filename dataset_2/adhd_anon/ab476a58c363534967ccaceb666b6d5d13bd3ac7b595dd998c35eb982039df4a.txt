Pretty much since I stopped growing and finished highschool. Getting my meds back in North Carolina was super easy because I had been going to the same doctor since I was diagnosed as a kid. 3 months supply of Concerta? "NO PROBLEM! I know you're not abusing." Plus my mom was always the one who handled the medication. All the names, doses, pickup, etc....  Now that I am married and have moved to Virginia, the past two years have been such a headache. Seems like no matter what documentation I provide, nobody wants to prescribe me the meds I need until I go to a psychiatrist. Finally make an appointment with psychiatrist for a month later...Doctor has moved. Make another appointment for a month later....Appointment canceled. Make another appointment for a month later (a month is always the soonest they can get me in.) Meanwhile, I'm going from "emergency refill" to "emergency refill" giving me JUST enough to get me by, all the while being met with skeptiscm as to why I have had to get so many. All of my backup, emergency stashes are dwindling and I hate not having the peace of mind knowing I have a few extra days if I run out...The people that abuse the medication really make it tough for the rest of us to get what we need.
