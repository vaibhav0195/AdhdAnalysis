I have dry mouth and suffer from sleep loss but honestly those things don't bother me. I know I am better on the medication than off of it. Yet, I keep finding myself not taking it. Like I look at the bottle and I know I should, but I don't want to. I don't want to take this thing that makes me a better person. And I've thought about it, I really have, and I don't know why I don't want to. I have no reason not to want it, I have nothing stopping me, just like...this urge saying "not now." Why is this happening?
