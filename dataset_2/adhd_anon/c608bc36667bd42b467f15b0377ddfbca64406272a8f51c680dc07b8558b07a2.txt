It's not the taste of the food, but the texture. Most fruits and vegetables cause me to gag and sometimes vomit. I was looking into potential ways to get over this texture issue, and I came across a few articles that claim that there may be a link between food texture issues and ADHD.   I was diagnosed with ADHD in second grade, and now I am 22.   Does anyone else here have a problem with food textures? Also does anyone have any suggestions on how to introduce new foods?
