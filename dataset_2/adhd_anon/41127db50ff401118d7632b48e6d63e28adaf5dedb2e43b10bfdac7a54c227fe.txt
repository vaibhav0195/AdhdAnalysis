I think it may be too high;;;Hello I am a 16 year old boy and my height is 5 feet 9 inches and I weigh 225 pounds. I was just diagnosed with ADHD last week and received my prescription today. The prescription is 50mg of Vyvanse. I am wondering is this too large of a dose for someone who has never taken ADHD medication before? Also, my parents are afraid that it may be addictive because it is such a high of a dose. Thank you to anyone who replies to this.
