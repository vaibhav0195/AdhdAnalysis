It's like the third time that I start writing this post because I'm drunk and I click other Safari tabs. My english is a crap, sorry.  OK. My therapist diagnosed me with ADHD a month ago. My life is a pure mess (lionel mess) right now. I was fired like 3 months ago from a cool company in the biggest city of my country and now I returned to my small hometown with my parents. I'm talented for what I professionally used to do but I need that + of effort and FOCUS. I can't.  I feel deeply unmotivated with almost everything. I'd spent like a week alone in my parents' house (they are on holidays) on the internet, jerking off with Tinder fatties and watching tennis. I don't feel the impulse of being with my friends/people. I love them with all my heart but I feel pretty bored. And now while I'm writhing this I'm feeling like guilty, but is my reality.  I only feel stimulated if there are women around. I think that this shit happens to me since always; I suppose that I'm seeking approval because of my insecurities or child/family experiences.   I'm attractive but I have being reading a lot about pickup on the internet and that shit destroyed my natural and authentic game with women. I used to be magnetic, lol.  So what?   I can't push me to go out with friends because my energy simply drops. If I don't hang out I am not going to improve my sociability. If I don't improve my sociability I'm not going to get the pussy or I am not going to be so successful in my career. BUT I CAN'T, I FEEL BORED AND WITHOUT ENERGY.  Does this sound familiar to any of you guys? Do you think that maybe it has something to do with ADHD? with fapping? with introversion? any advice? life is a game.  Hugs and thank you for reading
