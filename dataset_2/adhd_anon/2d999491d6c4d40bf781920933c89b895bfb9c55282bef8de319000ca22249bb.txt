Being diagnosed with ADHD/ADD and all?;;;I understand, this might probably be the last thing you want to hear.  Sometimes this thought might come across your mind when you're struggling with work or when you are thinking about yourself as person; using ADHD/ADD to define yourself, your thoughts, your actions, and everything about you. I do it too.  But recently, I got really tired of it. I wasn't mad at myself, I wasn't mad at my teachers and the people around me, I wasn't even mad at my ADHD/ADD.  I was mad at the fact that ADHD/ADD has become the answer and reason that has prevented me from reaching my full potential. Yeah, having accommodations at school help, having understanding teachers and family is great, but it seems like I'm the only one who doesn't want to say, "You know what? Fuck this ADD. Why does it have to put me on another platform without anywhere to go. Why does it have to be some sort of characteristic that I am bound by, with everyone around me treating me like a special human with special needs, unable to go left or right, up or down?"  I see posts here all the time saying how nobody understands what they're going through, as if they are restricted by an idea that they are and *always* will be slower than others.  What? Really? Doesn't anyone want to overcome their ADHD/ADD? Is everybody just relieved they've found a reason?!  I am not saying ADHD/ADD is false or a real thing, we have all experienced these symptoms as they are very similar and relevant to one another, but can't we have a sense of initiative and drive?  Does ADHD/ADD settle things with one single diagnosis? Has your fate been sealed?  **NO**.  I am tired of going through these struggles and being placed on another special platform. I want to pave my own path according to my initiative and drive; in this way, let ADHD/ADD be an obstacle, not a burden.  LET ADHD/ADD BE AN OBSTACLE. A TEMPORARY HURDLE. NOT A LIFELONG BURDEN.  It would be so easy to dismiss this post and go about your day, being another human with ADHD/ADD. Wouldn't it?  It's not about being lazy, it's about being indifferent and unmotivated. That shouldn't be related to ADHD/ADD shouldn't it?  **TL;DR I'M TIRED OF BEING HELD DOWN BY ADHD/ADD. WHY CAN'T WE TRY AND OVERCOME IT INSTEAD OF ACCEPTING OUR FATE?** ***LET ADHD/ADD BE AN OBSTACLE, NOT A BURDEN.***
