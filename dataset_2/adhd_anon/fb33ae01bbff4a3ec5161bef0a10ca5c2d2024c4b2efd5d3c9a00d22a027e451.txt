fb33ae01bbff4a3ec5161bef0a10ca5c2d2024c4b2efd5d3c9a00d22a027e451;;;dose not as effective;;;Hi all. I was diagnosed with adhd, mild ocd and gad a few years ago. I have been on 40mg of adderall xr for about 2.5 years (started at 20 and bumped up to 40 about 18 months ago).   We tried several meds in the beginning, as my insurance at the time allowed me to see a psychiatrist. I was formally tested. Concerta sends me into a blind rage when the meds wear off, adderall ir stopped being effective within about 3 months.  Now my insurance does not cover a psychiatrist so I see a general physician for my refills. He has access to my records, as he is in the hospital network that my psychiatrist was in.   The last 1-2 months, I feel like my meds are not effective. I'm spacing out a lot, getting disorganized, distracted. I'm not sure if it's related to stress or if it's related to my adderal dose not being effective. Honestly I think it is the adderall. How do I go about discussing the dose with my dr? My previous dr was experienced with meds so he would evaluate where I was every 3-6 months on dose and change based on his notes, my notes, and my therapist. I no longer see a therapist.  I just don't want to come off as a junkie or something.
