c709928ca89f745ba07da11ae2fb6a3e8dfa431fb8a693b43371abcff2de7384;;;I am scared...;;;**Too Long; Won't Make It Through**: I suck at change, but thanks to /r/adhd and a couple of other people I've got my first appointment. *Sorry for long post, just needed to get it off of my chest.*  **EDIT**: [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1fl0vw/to_those_of_you_with_adhdpi_have_you_experienced/) post hits home more than I would like it too sadly   I’m scared. I’m scared of the typical things people are scared of such as heights and needles. I’m scared of the not so common things such as not knowing how to do something or not living up to the expectations of those for whom I perform (TBH, sometimes I have trouble remembering what I’m actually like). What I’m scared of the most? Being different - being like everyone else.    For as long as I can remember, I've been the guy who forgets about his homework assignment until he’s walking into class, the guy who, when approaching his friends of 3+ years of daily interaction, forgets their names completely, the one who can’t remember what you said to him 10 minutes ago as he was walking from the lunchroom to class. I've been normal. I wasn’t no fool, however, and I knew that my normal wasn't everyone else’s normal.    Half-way through my senior year in high school, I found this neat little corner of the internet filled with people incredibly like me. The next logical step would be to interact and get the support backing of this community, but instead I did the internet version of running away – I closed the tab and ignored the subreddit. I was scared of the truth. I was scared that if I got the community backing and support, I would slowly become different – and that terrified me. I didn’t know how to handle different, I didn’t have coping mechanisms for different, I didn’t have a ‘routine’ for different.    One day it sort of just hit me.  I was awake late into the morning (much as I am now) and had gotten lost in my mind (nothing good on reddit(yay for getting 700ish posts in on /r/all) or YouTube anymore) and decided to give /r/adhd another peek. I started reading some of the all-time top posts and I realized that all of the sudden I had been crying – not because I was scared or upset – because I was actually happy. I felt like I had found ‘home’. Reading a bit more about other people I finally decided to give thinking about getting help a chance.  So after a lot of contemplating (and tons of note-taking so-as not to forget) when my first paycheck hits from my new job (delivery driver for Domino's) I’ll be starting to process of getting diagnosed and hopefully on the track to become a different me. I’m scared but hopefully it’ll work out.
