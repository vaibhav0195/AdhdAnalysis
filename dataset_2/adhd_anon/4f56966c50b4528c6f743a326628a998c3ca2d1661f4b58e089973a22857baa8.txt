I was diagnosed with ADHD around the age of 28, I'm 31 now. I've been seeing my family doctor and using Adderall XR to treat my symptoms for the last 2 years. I've never felt like the meds did much other than take the edge off my symptoms which was fine before I started taking on more responsibility in our family business.   &amp;nbsp;  Fast forward to this year. I'm the sales manager out our company, I do all of our tech work and I report quarterly sales figures (ugh I hate data entry). I've got strict deadlines to meet and people counting on me to get things done. I've also managed to piss of my sister and brother-in-law by being not so dependable. To put the icing on the cake their morning people who are frustrated with my old routine of come in around 9 AM and work later than everyone else. They get pissed if I'm not in the building by 7:45.                                                                          &amp;nbsp;  So I made the decision to finally get some extra help. I met with my new doctor last Friday and I feel like the first appointment went well. It was more of a "getting to know you" meeting. Lots of questions to establish what type of ADHD I have and to get us comfortable with each other. I go back next week for my second appointment.                             &amp;nbsp;  I'll keep everyone updated on how this helps with my ability to live and work with ADHD. If anyone has questions about my progress or what it's like working with a psychologist and a normal doctor feel free to ask.  I'd also love to get some advice on how to get the most out of this from people who have been there and done that. &amp;nbsp;                                                                                                                                                              &amp;nbsp;      **TL:DR - I finally decided to meet with a psychologist about my ADHD so that I don't get fired from work and destroy family relationships. If anyone has been on the fence about seeing this sort of Dr. feel free to ask me questions as I go through my treatment. Also would love to get advice from people who have had this type of treatment on how to make the most of it.**        Thanks. &amp;nbsp;  Jason  &amp;nbsp;  PS. Sorry about the lack of paragraph breaks. Reddit seems to like making it hard to format a post.
