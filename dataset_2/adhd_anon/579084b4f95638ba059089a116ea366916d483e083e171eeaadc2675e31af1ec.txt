I'm a 16 year old male and I'm being tested with a QB test tomorrow. I've always thought I was different my parents put it down to Aspergers syndrome, (she worked with autisic kids) but now I'm being tested for ADHD, I know roughly what the test is.   But what I really want to know is what to expect being diagnosed as ADHD. I'm worried people will treat me different because there is a guy with ADHD in my year, he is the nicest guy but he is always picked on by others, I know that even my closest friends have joked about it. Thanks guys, I appreciate any answers, I hope this wasn't to long.  **TL:DR** How do I live with ADHD in society?
