02c4fe3f651537108e5a6824cd3fdfee04bc4fbe9831d804b34bfd94b6827aed;;;Eating problems anyone?;;;I have a problem when i dont take adderall. i have to eat constantly just for the sake of chewing. i even started crying one time because i started eating paper because i had forgotten my medicine and it was too late to take it. i have to eat constantly. sometimes chewing gum helps but if there isnt any around i have a serious dillemma. i even wrote a short horror story based on it called "The Fat Man" about a man who begins to eat everything in sight. does anyone else have these problems?
