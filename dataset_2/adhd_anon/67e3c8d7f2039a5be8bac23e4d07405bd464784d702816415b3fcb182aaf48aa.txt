My doctor told me and I felt... nothing. Mostly because I wasn't surprised haha.   I've been living with this for as long as I can remember, and it was a random askreddit thread post that really opened my eyes to the idea. I've been lurking in this sub for the last month and decided to get a diagnosis.   Now onto treatment and medication.  Just thought I'd pop up and say hello instead of lurking forever.
