So i went to the therapist and he said that i was exhibiting signs of add/adhd. When he told my parents they refused to believe it. I have no focus, and i constantly get in trouble for doing stupid shit. I try to control myself but its nearly impossible.  I've gotten meds (aderall, ritalin) from my friends who have add/adhd. And they seem to really help. Im more relaxed, and more focused. I also smoke weed on the daily, that also seems to help (especially with my classes where creativity is key). So what I'm asking is , does anyone else have this problem? and if so how did you get past it?  tl;dr: cant get meds, impossible to control myself, any advice?
