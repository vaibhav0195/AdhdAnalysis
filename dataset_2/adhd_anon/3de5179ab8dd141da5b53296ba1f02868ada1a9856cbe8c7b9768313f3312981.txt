3de5179ab8dd141da5b53296ba1f02868ada1a9856cbe8c7b9768313f3312981;;;Just another career advice post..;;;I know this sub gets a fair amount of these types of posts, however I'm feeling a bit lost lately and figured it couldn't hurt to ask Reddit! First, a little bit about me! I'm 26 and was given my (at the time ADD, now termed ADHD-PI) diagnosis at age 8, subsequently I was put on Ritalin followed by concerta and have finally settled on adderall about 10 years ago.  I've held jobs in several fields of work and have not gone without a job in 9 years. I have a AAS from a local tech school in automotive repair and have a fair amount of other schooling that I have attempted (read: get bored and stop going) as well.  My true passion has always been cars and anything mechanical/motorized. When I was younger, I was very into computers and loved taking things apart (sometimes I'd even put them back together!!! Lol). Currently I work for a local major aerospace manufacturer and have been here over 4 years.  During my time here I've held an entry level manufacturing job, as well as been a team lead (focus and time intensive position here) and acceled decently at it for someone with my attention span. Currently I'm working as an electrical systems install tech and find my attention not being held by the tasks at hand no matter how I try and organize/ plan out my day..  What I'd like to hear from you, Reddit, is suggestions as to what I should do about my waning interest in my current 'career', as well as other career paths that I could persue that may be unknown to me at this time! Thanks for reading my life story..
