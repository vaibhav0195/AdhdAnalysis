This person was very patient when i myself am going through stuff (i never met anyone as patient as this person my whole life); i want to give back and do the same. I wonder if you guys can drop me some tips on how to take care of the likes relationship/friendship-wise? How do i deal with the persons highs and lows? This person is also already off medication and mood stimulants; i feel like it takes a great deal of effort on their part to stay focused without the stuff, or is it true or not? Is it okay for me to constantly bug this person to bring things to attention and remind them things they have to do or not? Also do you have any tips on what food/diet is best for their health? Thank you in advance!
