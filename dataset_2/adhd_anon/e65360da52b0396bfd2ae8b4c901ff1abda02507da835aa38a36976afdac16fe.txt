e65360da52b0396bfd2ae8b4c901ff1abda02507da835aa38a36976afdac16fe;;;New to Reddit and ADHD. Just diagnosed. What now?;;;     So, before I start I want you to know that this is my first post on reddit.  I've read all the rules and stuff but if there is something I've missed please  tell me.   So earlier this weak I was diagnosed with ADHD, I had been diagnosed before when I was very young but ignored It until now. It didn't seem like much of an issue at the time but now that I'm 19 I've really seen my life around me crumbling due to the lack of focus and drive. My question is what should I expect now that I've been diagnosed?       Ill be getting a prescription hopefully on the 29th and I really hope it helps.  I'm really hoping that my meds will help me focus even a little, because as it is now I can't even watch 5 minute youtube videos or read a page of a book. Has anyone here had any really good results with meds? I'm terrified that they won't work and I'll be a waste of potential my whole life. I consider myself to be a relatively smart person (who doesn't) but if I cant ever focus on anything for more than two seconds I might as well be stupid. My biggest fear is that nothing will work and life will go on  with my potential being locked in a steel cage.  I hope I haven't broken any Reddit rules or anything with my post. And I hope this wasn't too choppy or hard to follow.
