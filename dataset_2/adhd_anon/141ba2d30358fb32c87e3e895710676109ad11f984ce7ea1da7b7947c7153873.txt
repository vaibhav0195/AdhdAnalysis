141ba2d30358fb32c87e3e895710676109ad11f984ce7ea1da7b7947c7153873;;;Diagnosed with ADHD but I have a family history of depression/anxiety, could that be presenting as ADHD?;;;Just wondering because I am using Vyvanse right now and it works okay for the first few hours then it drops off pretty quickly. I am on a 60mg dose right now. My psychiatrist is stuck on this ADHD diagnosis but I'm just wondering if possibly it could be something else.
