Count.;;;One thing I haven't been able to control for years is preventing myself from spacing out in the shower (daydreaming, basically) and causing it to take much longer than it needs to.  As a guy, I USED to be able to take a 2 minute shower if I was in a hurry.  Years of business travel spoiled me into using standing in a nice hot shower as 'me' time because it was an unlimited supply of 'free' hot hotel waterâ€¦.
