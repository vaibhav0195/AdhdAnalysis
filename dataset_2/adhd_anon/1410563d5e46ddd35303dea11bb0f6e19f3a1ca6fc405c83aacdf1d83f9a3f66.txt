Graphs.](http://i.imgur.com/mZfC9.png)  [Graph 2 - wears off sooner](http://i.imgur.com/xZoqD.png)  (**edit**: graph updated to have units. whoops)  Context: I can only get the 10mg IR methylphenidate pills, as opposed to any of the extended/sustained release stuff - I was diagnosed about three months too late, thanks Australian rules saying XR/SR is only subsidised if you're diagnosed at &lt;= 18.  Taking an IR every four hours isn't quite optimal, though, since it gets a bit crash-y and it's somewhat uneven and basically just not ideal.  So I wondered what the graph would look like if I started with a 10mg IR, and then had 5mg every two hours after that. That's the blue; the pink is 10mg every 4 hours, and the yellow is the data straight from the PI for 10/10.  [it's obviously not perfect; I got the data from the PI and just subtracted the time-shifted first peak from the second peak to get what it might look like if you'd only taken a single 10mg; then added half of that on every two hours.]  tl;dr very rough graph of methylphenidate plasma level estimates for 10mg every 4 hours vs 10mg then 5mg every 2 hours.  Gonna give this a shot and see how it goes. [and yes, I have the psych's approval - don't try this at home, IANAD, etc.]

He said it's a relatively common thing that's done for autistic people with comorbid ADHD, and I was mostly just wondering if anyone else has tried the combination or knows much about it.  Thanks :)  edit: obviously I've talked it over with my psychiatrist, and I'm happy that it's a good enough idea for me to be comfortable trying it, and we talked about the pharmacology of it, etc - I'm mostly just curious for "how it feels" if anyone has taken it before; obviously taking into account that everybody's different.
