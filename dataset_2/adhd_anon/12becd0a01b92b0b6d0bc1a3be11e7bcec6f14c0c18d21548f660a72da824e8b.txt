I only recently 'found out' that i had it, however the symptoms have been apparent throughout my life. The main area of my life where problems occur involves my studies, however It does affect my work somewhat. I dont think my ADHD is severe, although It definitely has an impact. **My main question is that; given how soon I finish Uni, is it worth me getting a prescription for 'real life'?** The main area it affects me is my studies..but they will soon be over for good. What would you recommend?  **TL;DR: Title.**
