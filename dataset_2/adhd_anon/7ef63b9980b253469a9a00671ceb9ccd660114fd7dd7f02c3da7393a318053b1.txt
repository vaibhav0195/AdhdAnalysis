7ef63b9980b253469a9a00671ceb9ccd660114fd7dd7f02c3da7393a318053b1;;;I have yet again lost my ID, how does this keep happening?;;;i haven't posted on /r/adhd in awhile, in fact i haven't thought about my adhd in awhile. but its starting to really get to me.   so heres my story: i lost my id card case that had my student id, military id, my debit card, and the keys to my dorm, also the keys to have safe. I lost it this weekend when i was visiting my boyfriend who lives an hour away. So i can't even look for it.  Hes been looking for it but with no luck.   I'm super upset with myself, i've already lost my dorm keys and student id once this year. and they charged me $150 dollars for it.   My moms going to be super mad at me because i now have no form of identification. In order to get a new military id i have to file a police report then go to the military base and get a new one.   I hate being this unorganized. I hate being forgetful. I lose things min 5 times a day. :( this is after taking 50 mg of concerta a day. :(   What do you guys do to make sure you don't lose things?
