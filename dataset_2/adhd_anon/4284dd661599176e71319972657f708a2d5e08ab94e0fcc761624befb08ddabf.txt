Anyone else?;;;I had gotten testing (WAIS-IV, others) and the results were ADHD-PI , which wasn't surprising, but what was surprising was my learning disability in language comprehension.  Specifically it said I had a 7th grade level of language comprehension. I also was shown to have a high iq (125+) and problems with concept of reality.   After 2 months of bringing myself down to earth, I am starting to second guess my initial diagnosis. Does anyone else have ADHD and a learning disability like this?   I feel like I'm going insane with the endless wondering and would like to know if this is common or if anyone has this too and can share insight.  Thanks
