The thought of how much money I've lost because of late bills, forgotten fees, missing appointments, purchasing organizational tools that I never use, and losing stuff scares me.    My most recent blunder is carelessness with my expensive dental retainer/night guard. Instead of putting it in one safe place when I took it out, well, I didn't do that. Sometimes I took it out at the kitchen sink when I took meds in the am instead of putting in the case in the bathroom.   The retainer was a clear plastic color which, to be honest, i couldn't even see without my glasses because it disappeared into the background. It was missing. I looked everywhere. Then my stomach flipped over as I remembered scooping up paper and plastic grocery bags from the kitchen counter. I knew the retainer got scooped up as well.   A new one is costing $500.00! This time I'm getting it in PINK!   Do you have anything similar to share?
