67d5af3f358655473ded96f6a61fdfb017cb5d29bfc0c6a90caad41ed970c951;;;frustrated at lazy friends who suddenly also have ADHD;;;I know this is going to sound bitchy, but does anyone else know people who one day decide they have ADHD so they can get and abuse huge quantities of adderall? One of my classmates saw me taking adderall, asked me details about my symptoms and told me he had taken it (unprescribed) in college. Next thing I know, he has his OWN prescription, an ADHD diagnosis, and is pulling all-nighters fueled by adderall.
