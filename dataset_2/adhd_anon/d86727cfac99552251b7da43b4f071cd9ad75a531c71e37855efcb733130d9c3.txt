I'm on my last week of my first fill and I haven't really felt anything different at all; side effects or even benefits.  I am still as fidgety as I have always been, and it is still hard to concentrate on things, especially when it involves a lot of thought (just like how I'm avoiding writing a program in Assembly at this very moment).  During a single day about two weeks ago, I was just extraordinarily thirsty in my Physics Lab. I figure it was something to do with dry mouth. That, with the occasional jaw pain (I already clenched my jaw well before starting medication, so it may just be coincidence, but I figured I'd bring it up) and slight elbow joint pain at times (it comes and goes), I haven't really felt anything different while on medication.  I guess what I'm asking is, could the case simply be that my dosage is too low, or that Vyvanse isn't for me? If it's any help, I'm a 19 year old, ~180lb, 6'0" male.  Any and all information or advice is appreciated. I'll be emailing my doctor with information such as this and my HR/BP I've had checked weekly probably come this weekend.
