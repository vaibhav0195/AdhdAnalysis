I've never posted here before but I thought you all may be able to answer my question/ease my anxiety.  My son is 5 and has been on 1mg of Intuniv for 2 months. It was an absolute miracle pill for him. I am not even kidding. His doctor said that some point we would probably have to increase dosage to 2mg. We were hopeful that it would be in the distant future. Well, a couple weeks ago, our old friends anger, defiance, aggression, bossiness and bartering showed back up. I called to make a follow up appointment, and instead his doctor said to give him two 1mg tablets and see how that works. If there is an improvement, he will prescribe 2mg tablets.  I don't know why the idea of giving him 2 1mg tablets bugs me more than the idea of 1 2mg tablet. Is it the same thing?? He is on XR, so I am just nervous that it won't have the same affect or will have an adverse affect.  Any advice/thoughts is/are appreciated!!  TL;DR - Is two 1mg tablets of Intuniv XR really the same as one 2mg tablet?
