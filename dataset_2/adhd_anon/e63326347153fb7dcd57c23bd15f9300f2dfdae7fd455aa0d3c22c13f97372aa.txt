It worked for me for two years. However, since moving to Western New York (from somewhere more towards the middle of the US) I have found that NO ONE wants to prescribe things for ADHD. Period. I am very confused because it isn't as if I am asking for something I don't have a history with or a confirmed diagnosis of. People here say it's because so many people abuse drugs in the area, but I really, really don't think that's a good reason to resist medicating ADHD in someone who has it.   Does anyone else have this problem? I am curious why this is such an issue here and if it is similar elsewhere. If you have had this happen to you, how did you deal with it?
