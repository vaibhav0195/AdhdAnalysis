I can't remember a goddamn thing. Did I do that Calculus homework? Did I check my email? Did I take my medicine(15mg of extended release adderall). Did I brush my teeth this morning? Did I set both of my alarms?  etc etc. I have been rock climbing at the Universities rock wall for about a year now, and have been really enjoying it. I bought some $70 shoes for myself, and have used and enjoyed them quite a lot. Well apparently I've lost them. I can't find them in my room, at the gym's lost and found or anywhere. I lost a pair of Chacos sandals this summer too. I've lost countless keys, papers, my wallet numerous times, anything. I am a broke-ass college student, so whenever I lose anything more than $10 it isn't exactly easy for me to replace. $70 climbing shoe? Forget it, no way. And I fucking love rock climbing, but it looks like that wont be happening for awhile now. It is, or was my source of exercise, my way to vent out frustration and relax. I've forgotten friend's names that I've known for almost a year and have hung out with on multiple occasions. Many people think I'm an asshole I'm sure because I keep 'forgetting' their names. Nope, I just can't remember a fucking thing. On top of all this I'm doing poorly in school, my parents are getting divorced, and was recently diagnosed with depression(shocking!) for the first time in my life.   TL;DR I'm losing at the game of life
