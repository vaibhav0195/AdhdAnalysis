I scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist for tomorrow in approximately nine hours. I was diagnosed as a child(4th grade) and stop taking meds after a while and completely forgot about all of it. I had mentioned to a friend a while back that coffee makes me tired and he told me that I may have ADHD. Then I forgot about that.  Fast forward to last week, two cups of coffee, 10 AM, ready for another eight hours of sleep. Then I remember what friend said and called for an appointment after matching up symptoms to myself and ADHD. I wasnt sure that ADHD was my problem until an hour ago. I got on this subreddit, hit top&gt;all. And found that I am able to relate to every single fucking thing everyone has posted.  It feels very good to know where to go from here.
