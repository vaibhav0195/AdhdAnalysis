[UK];;;First things first. i am making an appointment tomorrow with my GP to see a specialist. i have done a lot of research on this, but nothing actually productive.  When i was at school, from Primary school (5 years old - 12/13?) I was always hyperactive and usually distracted everyone in my class. nearly all my reports were consisted of *"intelligent, but needs to apply himself or focus on the task at hand"* and i ended up being moved to a different school due to my parents disagreeing with the teachers who called me a problem child. so i ended up in a new school and it was the exact same, i ended up doing a lot of stupid stuff, so the school got a behavioural dude who said i may have ADHD, something which, again, my parents disagreed with them and nothing was done, and it was eventually forgotten about.  Life went on, highschool was the same, college *(the first 2 times on the same course)* again, the same. and i ended up doing a multitude of jobs, none of which lasted more than a year, i got my own house and since then it's always been the same. i am terrible at organizing things/paying bills/doing **ANYTHING** that needs to be done. my home is a mess, i haven't got around to getting carpets yet, i am useless at paying things on time and i have pretty much, as far as i feel, destroyed my life. i have lost my job, my girlfriend, and pretty much on the verge of losing my house. i **know** i need to do things, i need to pull my finger out of my ass and do things, but it feels impossible. i wouldn't sleep for days, and went to the doctors about it, which ended up with me on Zopiclone to help me sleep.  Anyway, one night as i was internetting, i came across [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3d1SwUXMc0) and a lot of the stuff he said fit into place, i actually cried and laughed as i could relate so much to the content and i remembered the old behavioural dude my parents ignored.  Ever since then i have soaked up everything i can about ADHD and can relate to near it all, i don't think i have as much hyperactivity as i used to, i still have spells of it, but no where near as i used to be. I am hoping things go well for me tomorrow, i am not expecting a quick-fix cure-all for anything, but just knowing that i **do** have a problem and can at least make steps/get help with my disaster of a life is helping my mind. i hope through methods/medication i can get rid of that 4am *life crashing down around me* feeling and i can finally be "normal".  edit:- I'll update thread tomorrow on the outcome of the appointment. *someone wake me up*  **Next Day EDIT:-** *Spoke to the Doctor, a different one than usual (good thing?) and made an Appointment to discuss it further and in-depth on Friday.* Made it on time though \o/
