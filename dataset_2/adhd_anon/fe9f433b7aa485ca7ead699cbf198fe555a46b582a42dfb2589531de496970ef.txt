Since then i did about a year on straterra, 2 years on concerta, 4 years off meds and now im back on concerta, 36mg. I've been fighting with something that i thought was part of my ADHD and was brought out by stress (i recently changed jobs and took on a LOT more responsibility). I'm starting to wonder (simply from observing when it is i feel it) if it isn't a side effect of my medication.  It's hard to explain, but it feels like my mind is just noisy. I function betteron my meds, so it isn't necessarily detrimental (and i wonder if it's always there and i only notice it when im on my meds), but it sure is distracting as hell. The best i can explain it is its like im standing in a room, right at the center. In front of me is the person/task i am working on. I have 100% focus on it, i'm not distracted from it, it's perfectly clear and normal. The room in front of me is entirely empty, except for this one thing. I assume this is what people with working brains feel like. But the other half of the room, the half that is behind me, is full of people, animals, video games, cell phones, tv shows. And i can feel the weight of all of it pressing up against the back of my mind. Again, it doesn't distract me from my task, though i do notice it, im aware of it at all times.  Physically it feels like theres something between my skull and brain and its absolutely buzzing with energy, looking for an outlet. Its like my meds take all of my ADHD and kick it out of my brain, but not out of my head.  Ok, so thats me trying to describe a mental ailment and maybe 3 of you grasp what i'm trying to say. I just wondered if this was something else other people with our particular gift dealt with.
