I recently started on Zoloft for my depression, and I feel like it's made my ADHD 10 times worse. I'm all scatterbrained, my focus is much worse, I'm fidgety and jittery and all over the place on time management.  Im only a week into Zoloft, so I'm likely still getting side effects, but has anyone else found antidepressants magnifying their ADHD symptoms?   I almost feel like my depression may have been an unconscious coping mechanism to slow down my ADHD.
