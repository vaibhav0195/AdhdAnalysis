ae3a0067c9deb38546867f43c1f78804d7befe485e405484c813fee3e6176129;;;[UPDATE] So I finally had a follow-up evaluation and a diagnosis.;;;I went with the specialist treatment center, as I would have had to wait for a new PCP to give me a referral and wait again to be seen by a psychiatrist.   And well, I was officially diagnosed with ADD, or ADHD-PI, on Tuesday.   I found the appointment pretty surreal. On one hand I am glad to finally be addressing this issue, and on the other I just never saw myself as having the disorder. I have seen countless therapists over the years to deal with short-term depression / depressive episodes and the SSRIs I was put on were zombifying. I always assumed I'd be in and out in treatment for depression; it was not until a therapist urged me to complete further evaluation that I even considered ADHD, even with my diagnosis from college.  My psychiatrist told me that medication would be helpful for me. I took my first dose of Adderall XR (25 mcg) on Sunday, just to make sure it wouldn't do anything unsettling during the workweek. It was not as bad or different from myself as I thought it would be, but it's still very different from what I'm used to. For one thing, I CANNOT take any caffeine with it. I made a mistake of taking it at 2pm yesterday and had a regular Coke in the afternoon. I was up until 2 am!  The only thing is I'm not sure what to do after my follow-up sessions (mostly to review my medication and progress) are over. I am trying to find a therapist that specializes in CBT versus talk therapy and I'm not sure where to start w/ that. Dr. really surprised me as we talked a lot about my history over the course of the evaluation (I thought only therapists did this). He seemed more hopeful for the long-term benefit of seeking treatment than I did.
