I was diagnosed with ADD by a neurologist when I was in high school and was prescribed Concerta. I didn't took Concerta for more than a year because it made me feel very anxious (very shaky hands, felt like my heartbeat was higher but didn't measured it so I'm not sure about this, I just had this uneasy feeling and often needed to get out of class to go for a walk to calm myself down).    I am now on my last year of university but I'm struggling a lot with school work. I can't read more than one/half paragraph without my mind wandering off for example. I really think I need to go back to medication so I can use my full potential, and I've made an appointment due tomorrow to see my neurologist once again.    I was just diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (seeing a therapist for this) this year, so I don't want to be taking Concerta again because I feel as it will worsen my anxiety disorder. Any advice?    Does anyone here has GAD/other type of anxiety disorder and can take medication for ADD without much of a side effect that will worsen your anxiety?   What about medications that are less known to give the sides effects I had on Concerta?   Thank you to anyone replying, I highly appreciate it :)
