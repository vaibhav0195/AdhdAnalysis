ed98ed04c235aaa6008c7d9671cdef4fe5daf30cab045d37285f3cda7ee8eaa1;;;Something I never thought would happen to me;;;Hey guys  So after a full year of going to university and failing a majority of my courses I've reached the end of line, I'm about to be academically suspended. This is such a horrible thing that I don't even know how to react. I just got back on meds but it can't fix the damage that I've already done to myself. I have to wait until the next semester to get another opportunity to maintain the required GPA and stay in school. I'm on the verge of breaking down and I just wish I could just get a chance now to make up for it, because I'm finally becoming the student I was when I used to be on meds years ago. I'm not sure what to do, I would have to go back home and leave my girlfriend alone with no one to turn to. My parents will be so ashamed about this. I guess I'm just going to have to suck up to the consequences, this will be something I'll look back on full of regret for quite some time. To anyone that's in the same situation as me or is struggling in school, don't let it get to your head. There are plenty of options for you and university isn't always the best one for everyone. If you aren't on medication or haven't sook help for your condition, I implore you to seek help because the difference between me off and on meds is night and day. Although it's hard for us to take initiative the moment we do can make a huge difference in how we live our lives. I thank all of you for the support you guys give each other and I hope every single one of you makes it out in this tough world we all live in. As far as what I'm going to do about my situation, I'll have to figure it out once I go through all the pain that I will cause my parents and girlfriend to feel when they get the news.
