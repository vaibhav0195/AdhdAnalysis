aad81f568f1bfdcd0bfe451eaf16edb417a9435606ed24f73f245697eae86061;;;Just a thanks to this subreddit;;;So I was diagnosed with ADHD as a child and was on medication till the age of 16 but stopped taking meds as soon as I could and was in heavy denial about it all as a teen. But thanks to this subreddit and your story's I have come to terms with ADHD and the fact it still very slightly affects my life, so thanks guys :) so I guess just keep sharing your thoughts :)
