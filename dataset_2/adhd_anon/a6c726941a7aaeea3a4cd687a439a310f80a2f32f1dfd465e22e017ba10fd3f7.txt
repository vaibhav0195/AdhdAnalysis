I started having heart palpitations once I took the 50mg so a couple days after we decided to go back down to 40mg, but after 4 days I started having palpitations once again. I feel that my dosage simply was too much with the 40mg, but my doctor decided to switch me to 30mg of Vyvance. I'm just really concerned that my focus will suffer because of the switch. Adderall seemed to really diminish my ADHD symptoms significantly and I'm just really nervous about how Vyvance will effect me.   What experiences have others had from the switch? If it doesn't work well for me should I go back and tell my doctor to lower my dose of Adderall?
