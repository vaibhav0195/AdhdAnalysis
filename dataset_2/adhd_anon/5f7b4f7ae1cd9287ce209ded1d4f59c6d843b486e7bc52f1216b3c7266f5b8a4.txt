It's even more frightening to realize how my functionality can be easily taken away.   https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/3kip78/how_should_i_go_about_getting_on_medication_again/  So I called and left a message to my so called current provider and she refuses to address my ADHD till my next scheduled meeting and accused me of cheating on a drug screen. I feel so frustrated. How can someone be so dismissive of my needs? What if I had been taking classes? It felt like my brain was melting the first couple of days. Now I feel better. But I don't know where to start now.  I spent several months of testing and referrals to get my diagnosis and I don't want to go through that expense again. Would it possible for an emergent clinic to provide refills till I become settled with a new PCP? I don't even know who to choose. It feel like grabbing names at random and hoping for the best.
