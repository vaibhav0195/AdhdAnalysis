I've heard that 10mg doesn't really do much for most people so I was wondering if I should go ahead and start it tomorrow or if I should wait until the weekend? I have only told one person at work so she can keep an eye on me if I start acting super weird on it but I'm wondering if it's a better idea to wait and see what happens on Saturday where only my roommate will see me. Thanks!

Just curious at the differences between people.;;;I'm a 23 y/p female that was recently diagnosed and started taking Adderall XR (generic) and I know everybody is different, but I'm up to 20 mg and don't feel a thing. There's still a song stuck in my head at all times and two conversations going on and I'm typing this instead of doing my job, forgetful, classic ADHD symptoms, etc. I also don't have the side effects like nausea and decreased appetite either. My friend who has had it since he was a kid says he almost doesn't believe that I don't feel anything, but honestly I don't. Maybe it's because it's XR and not IR? Just curious to see what kind of trouble you guys had to go through to figure out what worked, and what combination it was that you finally found.
