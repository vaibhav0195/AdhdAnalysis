ac4bb0e597284b33012dd8ddaf0fcab7d3b961f597cbc95b856c0bf9cafbcbc6;;;Stopped medicating because it took away my real personality;;;I'm 22 and was diagnosed 6 months ago with ADD and I've been taking 15 MG once a day for 6 months now. It seems that whenever I get out of work all I want to do is play video games and that's about it. Also my girlfriend and other friends have notice I'm not my self anymore.. I'm not funny or charming like I used to be.. so basically I stopped taking my medicine and I'm back to normal. My girlfriend loves who I am again and I do to...    The point.. should I try new meds or just stay clean off of them? And has anybody else experienced this "loss of personality" from adderal ?
