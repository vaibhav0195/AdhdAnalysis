It's retarded and downright dangerous.;;;This is a throwaway account because I don't want to associate this with my real account.  I think r/ADHD is awesome and has helped so many people, including myself, and I will forever be thankful for it. If it wasn't for this subreddit I probably would have gone through life without knowing what was wrong with me.  That being said, I see countless posts here that wants help with studying/focusing/working without taking medication. When asked why they're not taking medication it's always either "I'm not comfortable with it" or "I tried one medication 100 years ago and I didn't like it". Usually what follows is a lot of replies with some rather useful tips without any mention that the OP should stop being a bitch and take their medication.  I know there are people who needs additional help alongside their medication and I think it's wonderful that they're willing to put in more effort to better their lives. I also understand that if a person is happy with their lives and doesn't want to take medication, then that's cool, even if I personally think they're being stupid. But the most important thing is that they're content with their lives.  What I can't stand is people not taking their medication for a stupid reason. **ADHD is not something to be proud of.** We shouldn't embrace or glorify it. Yes, it's mostly treatable and it's an integral part of who we all are, but it's not something positive, especially not today. And that's OK, a lot of people have a negative part about themselves they don't like and they still can have meaningful lives. That doesn't mean that we should fool ourselves into thinking that the ADHD part of us is something to be proud about.  What do I want to say with this? Well for starters, please mention to people who aren't taking medication that they should consider taking medication and that there are so many benefits to be had that it's foolish not to take it.  And if someone has tried a medication but that they didn't like it? Suggest that they lower their dose or try another medication and most importantly, **to talk to their doctor.**   I hope you consider what I've said. I really mean well and I like this subreddit, I just think that it can be improved.  So the next time someone wants help without taking medication, then go ahead and post your tips and helpful guidelines but please don't forget to mention that the OP is being ignorant and that medication can have massive benefits and potentially few side effects.  Thank you for reading this and I would love your thoughts and opinions on this. If something is unclear don't hesitate to ask. Keep on ADHDn bros.  **tl;dr: make sure you let people who doesn't take medication for silly reasons know that they're being silly and inform them of the massive benefits medication can have.**
