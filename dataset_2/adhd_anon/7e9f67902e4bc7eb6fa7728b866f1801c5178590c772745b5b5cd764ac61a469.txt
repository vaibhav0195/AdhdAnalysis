7e9f67902e4bc7eb6fa7728b866f1801c5178590c772745b5b5cd764ac61a469;;;Emotional instability caused by Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria?;;;[RSD](https://www.additudemag.com/rejection-sensitive-dysphoria-how-to-treat-it-alongside-adhd/)  i don't think i'll ever be able to get to a point where i'm comfortable with being alone or comfortable with not being shown affection when i feel it's due. i need to work on myself but i truly can't find the motivation to do it. it's an endless cycle where my ADD makes my emotions go crazy n then won't give me that burning desire that i need to work on these crazy emotions. i don't want to live like this. I don't want to go on like this anymore. there's absolutely no part of me that feels like i can handle more of this than i've already had to deal with.   i need help
