He is on Vyvanse and has had a huge improvement in school. We still have  challenges at home, which I expect as he is an 8 year old. But we have tried everything for punishment from taking toys/video games away to the traditional time out and everything in between with little success.    Our pediatrician suggested a reward system, I have read very little about this and would like to hear how you do it. What type of behavior do you reward and what do you use as a reward?   Thanks for the ideas!
