3d4f912c55f0ad5b2ffff39b399adb48f03528322f08923608b6b23ebb6cb10a;;;ADHD and anxiety on meds????;;;So I recently was switched from ritalin to vyvanse and am finding that I don't feel any different focus-wise, but feel super anxious and overwhelmed, and at night it gets a lot worse and I feel very depressed. I started off on 30 mg and didn't feel it and just was upped to 50 mg and feel like shit. I loved ritalin a lot it made me feel so normal and I felt like I could think clearly and just felt happier, but it wore off so fast. My question I guess is, do any of you have experience with this? If so did anything help you? I also tried concerta and the same thing happened as with vyvanse. Maybe long lasting meds just aren't for me... sorry for being all over the place!! (ADHD am i right?)
