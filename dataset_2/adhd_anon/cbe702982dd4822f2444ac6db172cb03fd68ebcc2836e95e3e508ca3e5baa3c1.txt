cbe702982dd4822f2444ac6db172cb03fd68ebcc2836e95e3e508ca3e5baa3c1;;;I have ADHD-PI and really only have issues when I'm driving now. I'm thinking about going back on medication. What have your experiences been?;;;I was diagnosed when I was about 8 and took medication, mainly Straterra, until I was 12 when I requested to go off of it. I'm 20 now and have been doing pretty well without medication. I finally decided to get my ass into gear and learn how to drive, and I find that my inattentive habits have started appearing again. There are very few activities in my life that require 110% attention like driving does. I'm not a dangerous driver by any means (I think I'm actually pretty good for my age and experience level), but the thought of all that attention psychs me out. I also have some anxiety issues that are making my worries worse.  What have your experiences been with medication and driving? I have an appointment with my doctor next week to discuss my concerns and I want to be semi-prepared.
