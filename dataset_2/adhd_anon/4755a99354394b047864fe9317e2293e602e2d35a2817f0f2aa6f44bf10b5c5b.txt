Managing my ADHD with Vyvanse has been life-altering! My first doctor was very good at working with me for my treatment, however, I just found out she is leaving the state very soon. I tried to call another psychiatrist to resume treatment but was told she won't see new patients until March.   The real questions is: what can I do to get my refills in the meantime before I can get an appointment elsewhere? Is this something my primary doctor can do? I'm in the US if that makes any difference.  Any advice or insight is much appreciated!
