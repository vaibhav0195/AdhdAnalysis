Today, that hyperactivity is mostly gone, although slight signs of hyperactivity comes around from time to time. Inattention is definitely still around, but I don't know if I should call myself -C or -PI. Can anyone tell what type I am? And if not, where can I find it out (no, I will not go to my physician at the moment, I have a lot of things to do, and ADHD is making me too lazy to do all of them, despite my "efforts")?
