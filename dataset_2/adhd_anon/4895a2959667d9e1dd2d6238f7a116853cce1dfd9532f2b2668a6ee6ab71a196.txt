I was never a hyperactive child, but I almost failed the third grade because I couldn't concentrate and would often lose large portions of the day without knowing what happened. The only behavioral problems I had were that I would "zone out" or get distracted by simple things like the eraser on my pensil. After I was diagnosed, my mother did research to see what our options were. She didn't want me taking pills for the rest of my life and the short time that I did take Ritalin, there were many negative side effects.   I was taken to a therapist who specialized in ADD/ADHD. There, I went through a series of tests, including having my brain waves measured. In the following months I went through biofeedback therapy. Electrodes were attached to my head and I was told to focus on a computer screen. If I concentrated hard enough it would make a fish swim through a maze or a race car drive around a track. Aparently this worked, because I haven't taken any medication for ADD since I was 9  years old (I am now 24). I continued the rest of my education through college with decent grades. I still "zone out" some times, especially if I'm tired or bored, but as an adult, it's really more of a personality quirk than a disorder.  TL;DR, I was diagnosed with ADD at in the 3rd grade and went though biofeedback therapy which did wonders for me.  Anyways, I was wondering if anyone else has had experience with biofeedback therapy. If not, what was your ADD/ADHD experience? How has your diagnosis affected you?
