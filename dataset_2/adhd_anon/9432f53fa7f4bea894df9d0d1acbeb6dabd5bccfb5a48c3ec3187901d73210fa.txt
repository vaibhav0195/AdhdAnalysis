9432f53fa7f4bea894df9d0d1acbeb6dabd5bccfb5a48c3ec3187901d73210fa;;;I get severely negative and frustrated over the smallest things.;;;Anyone else get the same thing i do? I can go from being the most pissed off and negative person to being happy and positive. Every time I think about how I can't study or read without being distracted usually throws me into this type of depression.  This has also caused me so start smoking pot and cigarettes to distract me from the fact I can't focus or study. If anyone has any tips or techniques with studying and reading I would appreciate it!
