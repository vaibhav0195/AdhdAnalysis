Need some help finding a med that doesn't make me feel like I'm going to explode.;;;**Diagnosis:**   ADHD at age 13, no medication. Medication started at age 28, after being re-diagnosed with the [Quotient Test](http://www.additudemag.com/adhd/article/8454.html). I ended up falling into the &lt;1 percentile, in almost everything, which means that my ADHD was, and remains, atrocious.  **Medication:**  1. Tried Adderall and Adderall XR and a combo of both. Made my symptoms better per Quotient test, but left me jittery as fuck.   2. Tried Vyvanse. Started at 20mg, ended at 90mg. Only side effect was a dry mouth. Quotient test proved that 90mg did NOTHING, so back to Adderall.  3. Still hated Adderall. Put on Concerta.  4. First hour or two on Concerta I feel like I'm going to have a heart attack. It's bad. Really bad. Like... I'm afraid my heart will jump out of my chest bad. After that initial scary bit, I am able to concentrate for the majority of the day.... However, once it hits 4:00 or so, I'm ready for a nap. (Luckily, I'm a substitute teacher by trade, so I am done for the day by then.)  **TL;DR of Above:**  Adderall, Concerta work for me but I feel jittery and want to explode. The Vyvanse, she does NOTHING.   **Requestion:**  (I accidentally wrote the above and I like it, so it's staying.)   Now I'm wondering, is there anything I can do to make my life better? Is there a medication that won't make me feel like my heart is going to come out of my chest or my teeth will tap themselves to death?   **Final Thoughts**  I recently told my therapist that my ADHD without meds is like... a jar stuffed full of cotton balls, with the lid forcing it closed. Every thought is pressing, and trying to get out, and trying to take out one cotton ball is impossible because they all explode out whenever you try to do so.   Living off meds is tough for my brain.  Living on meds is tough for my body.  I just want to feel better.  Help?
