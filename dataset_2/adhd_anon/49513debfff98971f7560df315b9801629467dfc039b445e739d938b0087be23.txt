I have asked her about what an accountability group does in the past.) exact quotes in italics.   Her: would you like to join an accountability group?   Me: no thanks. It wouldn't motivate me.   Her: what motivates you?   Me: *only extreme and immediate consequences.. I don't know... electro shock therapy? Lol! Let me explain.. I was recently diagnosed with ADHD. Being unmotivated is kind of a defining characteristic for me and people like me.*  Her: *have you ever tried to change your thought processes around it? Like do affirmations that say you ARE motivated and ARE committed? I know it sounds kinda silly but they do actually work! It's not overnight for sure but it can literally rewire your brain!*   Me: *can it regrow pieces that aren't there?* (I'm LOL'ing at this point...)  Her: *you can create new neural pathways in the brain! It's like a muscle- always changing and growing!*  Who knew? ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚.   She means well I know-  but I was just diagnosed 2 weeks ago and these types of interactions are all still new to me. It was probably a rookie mistake even mentioning ADHD but you live you learn lol!   Cheers.
