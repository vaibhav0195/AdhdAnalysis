954a60bad6e1d2ee1bde9283c874b56fdb86637b404fdbc236e8616269557dff;;;Picking up my testing results today and I'm really nervous;;;I'm really sure that this diagnosis makes sense, but there is a seed of doubt in the back of my head. I was diagnosed once as a kid, but my parents never told me about it and never put me on medication. After going on academic probation in college I made a big enough stink about it that they acquiesced to more testing, at which point I learned about the first round of exams done when I was 10. I'm pretty sure I undersold some of the symptoms I experience in my intake appointment-- I was still pretty sold on their narrative that I was "just a lazy and spacey kid"-- but I can't know what will happen before I go in and pick up the results. It's been two months of waiting and I'm so anxious about this!
