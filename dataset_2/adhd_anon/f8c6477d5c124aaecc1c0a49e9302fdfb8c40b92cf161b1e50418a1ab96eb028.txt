Have been diagnosed and dealing with ADHD for most of my child and adult life. I'm 25 now and along with Adderall I self medicate with nicotine. I'm in the middle of my fall semester and even with medication (opposed to last fall with none), my new classes require 10x the focus that my last classes did (Civil war history especially since I have no interest, not to mention I had to take it as a 'filler' class and it doesn't count toward my major).   Not looking particularly for advice. My last appointment they didn't want to raise the dose which is fine but now I'm thinking of trying a new medication out in hopes that it won't make me feel extremely depressed and awful once it wears off.
