It's confirmed I have ADHD-PI and an anxiety disorder. As the first is no surprised, i was a bit shocked by the second one.   Also, with the evaluation I received recommendations to help me out.   1- Sleep more (get the 8 hours you need) 2- Exercise more (30 min daily) 3- Take breaks more often (while working or studying) 4- Meditation  Evaluator is not recommanding meds.   My first reaction : Shit, I did all this for that!!!   I was really, really, disappointed.  There was a time in my life where I did use all 4 recommendations, it helped a bit, but... not enough.   Also, I did really well in all test, IQ test overall was above average. The tests where I did not do good because of ADHD, I hit average. That's why I pass under the radar for so long.  I fear that because I hit average on some test, my ADHD won't be taken seriously. At least my SO is, which is alot for me. I also fear of going back to work (went back to college, I'm now 33) and falling back to the same patterns (over procrastination, late all the time, working at 25% of my potential, guilt).   I also talked to my mom, who I believe as ADD-pi too, however her reaction got me evermore frustrated. I receive the "I went thru it alright, you should to". Completely ignoring my struggle or acknowledging how difficult it can be.   **If you can I'd like some word of encouragement or wisdom, if you can afford it.**   **;TLDR; Received my DX ADD-PI with Anxiety disorder. Doc gives basic recommendation. I feel disappointed but meds not being recommended.  Great support by SO, poor by family.**
