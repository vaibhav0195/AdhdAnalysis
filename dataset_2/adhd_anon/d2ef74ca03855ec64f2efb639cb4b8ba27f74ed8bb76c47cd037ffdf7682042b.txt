d2ef74ca03855ec64f2efb639cb4b8ba27f74ed8bb76c47cd037ffdf7682042b;;;Funky symptoms on Vyvanse?;;;I started taking Vyvanse my Junior Year of High School (now a Junior in college) and I remember it worked wonders; great grades, got myself into Purdue University, was performing well at work, etc. I was up to 70 MG before I finally stopped my sophomore year of college because my schedule was just far too erratic to fit Vyvanse in anymore. My grades dropped tremendously (3.9 to a 2.6), I had trouble waking up or following any routines and all of these things led to a huge slump.  I'm now going into my junior year and I've started Vyvanse again at 30 MG, after realizing I cannot function between school and full-time work without it. I've been back on it for about a week. I'm having these horrible symptoms that I just don't remember having before. I'm shaky and insanely nervous, VERY, VERY irritable. I'm content sitting alone with something to work on, but when someone wants to talk to me or take away whatever it is I'm doing, I get livid for pretty much no reason. The worst symptom, though, is that I feel like I cannot get any air. It's that feeling you get when you have to yawn, except it's non-stop and when I do get relief it's short-lived.  Has anyone else had these symptoms/know how to cope with them? I'm worried that they won't clear up anytime soon and I'll be in a pickle. I've been diagnosed since I was 6 (now 20) and this is the only medication that hasn't made me go absolutely bonkers or depressed.  TL;DR: What were your weirdest symptoms on Vyvanse and how long did they take to clear up?
