Started on low dose of ritalin this April, moved to Concerta 18 because it hardly lasted even 2 hours. Concerta 18 worked a little at the beginning, but lost effectiveness pretty quick. Moved to 36mg. Same thing. Just moved up a week and a half ago to 54 mg. Same thing....EXCEPT....side effects!   Here is the question: When taking concerta, how did it make you feel? If you switched to something else what made you switch? And what did you switch to that worked for you?  I have been a mood swinging nightmare on this stuff at 54 mg. Sad, irritable, no motivation. Just feeling super lame and sad mostly. Or just no emotion at all which i think is worst. Have any of you experienced this? The only thing that makes me feel better is working out. I really notice no change to my focus and its probably worse since I'm in such a funky mood =/   I know it is the Concerta since I feel great before I take it and after it wears off. By great I mean my normal happy disposition.   TL;DR If Concerta didn't work for you, what did? Bonus: is it super weird that it is making me sad and mood swingy?   Thanks guys!
