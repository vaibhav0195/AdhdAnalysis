My meds help me focus but are destroying my motivation.;;;I was diagnosed 10 months ago. Went on Concerta for just over a month, but it wouldn't allow me to talk to people... I couldn't be social. Then I went on Adderall however I've noticed over the last couple months my motivation has severely dropped. I don't feel motivated to do anything. I used to be big into the gym and mountain biking however I can't even motivate myself to leave the house. Also starting to have problems being social again.  I'm on 40mgs of Adderall XR. I've tried taking less but 20mgs does nothing for me. Should I consider changing up medications? Also considered adding Wellbutrin. Just don't know what to do.
