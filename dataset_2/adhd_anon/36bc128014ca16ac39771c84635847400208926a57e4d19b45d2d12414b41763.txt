36bc128014ca16ac39771c84635847400208926a57e4d19b45d2d12414b41763;;;My son is diagnosed ADHD ... Now, all of a sudden; I believe I've ADHD my whole life ...;;;I always thought I just had an issue with boring stuff but always knew I could somehow make it up it with the stuff I enjoy ....  Shocking grades through school but still felt smart ... Didn't go to college .... I did really well at jobs that required impossible outcomes ... Jobs that needed heroic endeavours ... My first job was working the factory floor in the fashion industry .... in a shoe factory actually, and I was the go-to guy to get your sample made ... All the marketing guys would come to me, not the pattern room, and I'd literally deliver their sample back to them Hot in hand in less than an hour.... But get me on a spread sheet, or ask me to do my travel expenses forget about it ...I simply can't do those boring things ... I've never imagined that these traits were adhd I thought I was being an arse ... But couldn't help it ...here's what's freaking me though... Something of what was uniquely 'me' is supposedly to be labelled as a disorder and deficiency ... That seems wrong ... That hurts me.... But if I do have adhd then I can help my son coz the parts of my life that were frustrating at school if they can helped, then he can make choices about what he wants to do ... Go to college, get a trade become an entertainer ...stuff it couldn't do coz not diagnosed - I'm 48 - am I too old for meds ? How will they help an old man like me ?
