I've started dating a guy with ASD and so far it feels like we each have strengths where the other is lacking. He has focus to see things through and in social situations I can talk nineteen to the dozen so he never has to worry about making conversation. My only worry is that when the first flush of love wears off I might find his desire to talk about his special interest boring. Anyone been here before?
