ADD might not be your problem â€”Just found out today I actually have narcolepsy.;;;**TL;DR Narcolepsy is underdiagnosed, and can be misdiagnosed as ADHD. If you experience excessive sleepiness, look into it. I found out today that I am a narcoleptic, and it's the biggest relief I've had in this lifelong mental battle for social/academic motivation.**  EDIT: *Narcolepsy does NOT mean you randomly fall asleep all the time a la the movie Rat Race.  While this can be a symptom, it is not a defining factor. Narcolepsy is marked mainly by abnormal sleep cycles, which can be seen in a sleep study.  The ability to have vivid dreams during short daytime naps is a big sign of this.*  **My Story:**  I was always smart in school, but began struggling at about 8th grade, and had issues ever since.  I got diagnosed with ADD, and have been struggling with motivation issues ever since then. I've always had sleeping issues, but disregarded them as having an irregular sleep schedule.  **My new diagnosis:**  Recently I made friends with a narcoleptic who happened to be on the same meds I was on for ADD (Concerta). We got to talking, and her symptoms sounded identical to mine, and I was convinced I had a sleeping disorder.  I got tested, and was just got diagnosed today. *It was one of the happiest moments of my life. So many issues I've had in the past now have a legitimate cause, and I know I wasn't just being an irresponsible prick.* I now know what I'm dealing with, and how to proceed in the future.  While narcolepsy symptoms vary among patients, I'll share mine to help you recognize what lead me to get diagnosed.  **Here are MY symptoms:**  * **Excessive daytime sleepiness**  * **Vivid dreams even during short daytime naps**  * **Impossible to wake up** (my wife will have arguments with me in the morning trying to wake me, and I won't remember it.)  * **Wet the bed until 7th grade.**  * **Emotionally disinterested/never shows emotion, even if you're interested**  I've always been known for being very laid-back...almost *too* laid-back.  I'd never show lots of excitement of disappointment over anything.  * **Tossing and turning a lot during the night** This one I wasn't aware of until I got married and got kicked out of bed multiple times. (which I don't remember, but only know because I woke up on the couch and was told about later)  I don't claim to be able to diagnose you, but I know a lot of people in this subreddit are as frustrated with motivation issues as I have been, and you're looking for answers.  It's a rare disease (about 1/2,000 people in the U.S.), but it's often misdiagnosed as ADD, so I'd expect there to be a few unaware narcoleptics in this subreddit. Whether or not you have it, it's one more possibility to explore.  Edit: Gotta put in a plug for /r/Narcolepsy here.  We need more members!
