dec61a487b786f7907090a146383ac733a079ad1dc796428bac6e0674cbc17e3;;;AD(H)D and summer heat;;;When temperature hits 28/29C (84F) and above, I witness an increase in   - irritability   its like I get constant annoyed by anything and everyone.   - my focus is gone,  - distract-ability gets worse.   I've read a post in add forum http://www.addforums.com/forums/showthread.php?t=31191 which is also about this subject, and I was wondering how are you guys doing in the summer? Do you witness an increase in symptoms? How does the sun effect our behavior if so ? And what could we do to stop this from happening? Maybe Drinking more water to keep our mind cool?  As far as I know there isn't much of research going on, on this subject?   Anyway I'm really looking forward to the answers!
