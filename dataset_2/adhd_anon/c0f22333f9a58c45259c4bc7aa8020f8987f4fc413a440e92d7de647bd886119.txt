THANK YOU in Advance!;;;Some background:  * I am a 41 y/o woman with documented ADHD symptoms as far back as when I was 7 via a WISC test to determine psychological impairment. * I visited psychiatrists and neurologists in my 30's. Started on Wellbutrin, to no effect, even at 450mg of Wellbutrin XR. * Later, was diagnosed with ADHD and Depression. Prescribed Prozac and Concerta which seemed to work awesome, until weirdly, about 4 months later, it all fell to shit. * Tried Adderall - gave me such pain in my mouth (neuralgia, paraesthesia) I had to stop amphetamine-based stimulants altogether * Gained tons of weight on various anti-depressants. Gave up and tried to go off all psych meds altogether, both ADHD and Depression meds. * After 12 months, I am a mess. Can't do anything, it seems. Contacted new Psychiatrist who evaluated my school records, even though I asked her for anti-depressant meds. Based on my records, at 41, she says she must first treat me for ADHD, and will only later if it does not work treat me for depression. * 36mg of Concerta - her first choice for meds - isn't doing diddly for me. I take it a 7AM and am ready for a nap at 2PM. Isn't this supposed to be a **stimulant**? How does it make me want to sleep? Tried 54mg (which I tried before with another doc) by adding the original 18mg she prescribed for me, and it doesn't help.  Any suggestions for next steps? I go to see her in a week, and I don't know what to tell her. I still feel depressed and unmotivated. When I **first** started on Concerta at 18mg I felt like I could do something, and I did, for about 36 hours. Then it's been a waste. Can you start on a med, feel really amped for a short period of time, and then have it fall by the wayside effectiveness-wise? Doubling it to 36 (and on my own to 54 a couple of times) just hasn't helped. Why was it so helpful at 18mg on the first 2 days, and just useless now?  Thanks folks, for whatever wisdom you've got. I really could use it.

I do exhibit mild OCD behaviors daily, especially around organizing very specific things like those plates, which I have to stop and rearrange anytime I find he's put them in the wrong order.  I read that there's some co-morbidity between the two disorders, but mostly in men, not women. Does anyone have any more anecdotal experience, or even just good articles?  I don't understand how my brain and house can be such a mess, but something as little as the colors of stacked plates are so important I can't let it go for five seconds.

I am beyond standard "therapists" these days. I already know the cognitive behavioral issues that stand in my way. I have worked through my "mommy issues" and all that crap in past years. The last time I tried a therapist I told her all I have done and frankly, after two sessions she had no other suggestions.  So now I turn to the topic of **ADHD Coaching** which is a varied and wild world. I have tried an ADHD coach, and for the first month this person was fairly useful. The issue is that my coach has first-hand experience with ADHD, as they had it themselves.   This caused issues for me, because we would agree on the coach reaching out to me for "accountability" things, and well, for the first three days it worked. Then we both fell into our usual habits of "forgetting". My coach also rambled and switched topics a lot, so we were in essence, floating along the ADHD spectrum trying to stay on topic and find focus but not really getting there in our weekly discussions.  I will say I did learn **a lot** from this person, and I feel that they prodded me forward to change several key behaviors that I had, and those changes are still holding strong, which is wonderful. But once I got through those major issues, I am feeling like the 'finessing' of my concerns and issues are falling by the wayside. So, I have asked to discontinue services from this person, and either it's true ADHD, or they really don't care, I haven't heard from them one way or the other. I presume I won't get a Paypal bill in 3 weeks and if I do, I will burn their phone lines up complaining that we haven't talked in that much time.  So my question is this: What types of ADHD coaching are out there? Are there people who aren't ADHD providing coaching? The folks who **do have** ADHD are good at intuitively understanding my needs, but then the general characteristics of our disorder make it tough to really get what I need from them.  Does anyone else have an ADHD coach who really works for them? What's that relationship like? What do you learn from them? Do they also have ADHD?  The things that make us empathetic to each other are also the things that prevent us from structuring and following a plan for improvements. It's truly the blind leading the blind in this world, as far as peer coaching from other coaches who have ADHD is concerned. I need someone who will truly hold me accountable, help me change my behaviors, and help me understand what I want - as everything distracts me and it all seems interesting until I really get into it.  Thanks for any advice or thoughts you can provide, netizens of /r/ADHD....

A great idea for motivating a team, and it even helped ME focus for an hour!;;;OK - So in spite of this ADHD thing, I manage a team of five people at work. Someone sent me this link to a concept called "Guilt Hour". I loved the idea, but I hated the name tremendously.   Basically you open a bridgeline, everyone discusses for the first few minutes what they'll be working on for the hour, and then you leave the B/L open but everyone stops talking (unless they're collaborating) and works "heads down" on whatever it is they've designated to do for the hour. At the end of the hour, you get back on the B/L and talk about what you accomplished.  http://actionmill.com/blog/get-your-team-unstuck-with-guilt-hour  I told my team about the idea and how I hated the name, so we call ours "Happy Hour" because in theory, at the end of the hour you'll be happier about doing something you'd been putting off.  We had our first one today and it went great! I personally loved it because I committed to clearing out my inbox and replying to emails. So many times I was tempted to stray, as I usually do, from my task but the knowledge that I had the responsibility of reporting in at the top of the hour kept me working and focused.  --- Agenda:  * 1:00-1:10 – Declare it: Your task to work on  * 1:10-1:50 – Do it: Bridgeline remains open, team works on tasks “heads down”. Use the bridge for questions or collaboration if needed.  * 1:50-2:00 – Move on: Share whatever victories we can!   Ground rules: No guilt! Only happy! Collaborate when needed. Come prepared with what you want to work on.  ---  It worked so well my team wants to keep doing it every week. Thought it might help some of you here, if you could suggest it to your teammates, managers, etc.

We always get the male perspective, what is yours?;;;The other thread regarding ideas for a book got me to thinking that we don't really self-identify the women of this forum with ADHD.  ADHD is so often presented as a male issue, especially with hyperactivity. With a few exceptions, we women tend to be daydreamers. We're mostly PI, although some of us can be Combined. (I am, due to being inattentive and also impulsive, but *not* hyperactive at all.)  Please tell us about yourself? What's your diagnosis? Do you fit the "female ADHD" mold of PI, or do you break it with some good ol' fashioned hyperactivity?  What meds are working for you? Which have not? How have you handled meds and your pregnancy, if you've had children? I was surprised to read that one woman noticed her menstrual cycle included several days where, due to hormonal reasons, her ADHD meds just don't work. Do you notice that too?  We're rather different from the majority male ADHD folks. What do you think contributes to a unique female perspective? Would you be interested in a /r/adhdwomen group or something like that?   I'd like to just hear from us ladies. I always feel so alone in having this disorder. It's just not *diagnosed*, don't you know? People look at me like I'm crazy because I'm so *not* hyper. What are your experiences? Please chime in.  **EDIT:** Probably the most participatory thread I've ever created. Thank you! Keep 'em coming! I'm trying to read/upvote everything. It blew up after I went to sleep.   Also, I have learned that many of you are indeed quite hyperactive. I never realized that. I thought by and large we XX'ers were PI daydreamers. I see a lot of myself in some of these comments. It's really awesome to know I'm not alone. I do the "default Reddit gender assumption" thing a lot, so I never realized how many women were replying/posted in threads here.
