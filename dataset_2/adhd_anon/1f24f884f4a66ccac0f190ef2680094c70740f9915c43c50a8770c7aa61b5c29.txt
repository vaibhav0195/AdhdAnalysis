(Look up [steroid dementia syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid_dementia_syndrome) for more info.)   The TLDR version of the story is that I talked to my doctor about it and went off all of my asthma/ADD/depression medications.  I've been off them for nearly two weeks now, and I'm already feeling better.    **Now I'm wondering, how many other people are being diagnosed with ADHD, depression, and memory (or learning) problems when in fact it is due to taking steroid medications?**  I've seen articles that try to link asthma to ADHD in kids, but what if it's not the asthma, it's the medication that's causing the ADHD?   In my case I took fluticasone propionate, but it seems that all glucocorticoid medications (prednisone is a common one) can cause memory and attention problems due to the elevation of cortisol in the body.
