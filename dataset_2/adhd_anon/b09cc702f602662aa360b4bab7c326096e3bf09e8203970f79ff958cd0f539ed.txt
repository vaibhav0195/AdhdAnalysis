b09cc702f602662aa360b4bab7c326096e3bf09e8203970f79ff958cd0f539ed;;;Do I actually have ADHD?;;;When I was little, I was diagnosed with ADHD because of my tangential and hyper personality and was put on ritalin (which I haven't taken in 10 years now) However: I do not have (and have never had) hyperactivity, fidgiting, or inattentiveness of any kind.  I am a relatively calm person and I can focus just fine.  It's just that my mind is overflowing with ideas and I feel like I have to share them with people.  My mind races 100% of the time, and I have great difficulty sleeping at night. A friend of mine said that I was "literally a genius" and that they had misdiagnosed me as someone with ADHD because of "the sheer amount of goddamned creative content you put out all the fucking time." I'm open to this possibility, but I don't honestly think I'm a genius. Do you think I have ADHD, Reddit?
