It has got to the point He doesn't want to be in school anymore, and our relationship has been quite rocky. We have a very strong bond and connection otherwise in the past. This past month I've been having trouble coping with the changes I've seen in him, esp with any medications he has tried make him feel worse, and not himself. I am trying My hardest to help him out and such, but I feel myself losing patience at times. I've also noticed that I can't drink alcohol and be around him because it seems to make me more angry towards him due to all of this. I really want any advice I can get to help me cope, so I don't ruin the relationship completely.
