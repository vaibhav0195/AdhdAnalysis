I have been on Adderall for 3 years now, and when diagnosed with depression in December, I was immediately put on Prozac 20mg.    Now, I feel like depression very may well have been at the core of the issues I was facing, so I began to take the Prozac everyday. After a few weeks, a week into the new semester, I began to feel great: I was more motivated to learn, I was determined to do well academically and socially, I felt alive and ready to mingle with the world again, and so on. At this time, about a month after beginning the Prozac, I had missed two days of classes without notifying my teachers (Tues &amp; Thurs). The first day of my return, I was running about 5-10 minutes late and, while standing right outside the building, had a panic attack and walked away. This imagined anxiety of my confronting my teachers after an unexplainable absence steamrolled, and soon I was no longer attending any classes, not ever leaving my room, and dying inside.  At this point I thought I was in the "deepest of my depression" and, technically, I was.   However, in hindsight, I think the depression I (and possibly many of you?) experienced was a direct result/creation of an undiagnosed and untreated anxiety disorder. We ADHD'ers procrastinate things, leading to high anxiety, and if the procrastination/failure to do things steamrolls (like mine did), then a depressive state occurs, leading to a "Depression" co-diagnosis rather than the core issue at hand: "Anxiety".   **TL;DR: I feel like ADHD/Depression is often misdiagnosed as ADHD/Anxiety**   So, how many of you feel that this may be the case?
