This sounds for the most part as a success and for the most part it is. I am unmedicated as I haven't been diagnosed since I was a child. As I learn more about what the job entails I doubt my ability to do it in a manner that won't end with me being fired, fined, or both (The job deals with information of a sensitive nature and is in a call center). I tend to make stupid small mistakes the sort that Ive heard alot about this last week that could end in any part of the aforementioned trifecta. I'm not sure if I should just tough it out for a few weeks so I can get a little money or if maybe things aren't as bad as I seem to think they are.
