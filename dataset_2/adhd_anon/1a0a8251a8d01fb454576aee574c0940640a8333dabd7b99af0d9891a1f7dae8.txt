1a0a8251a8d01fb454576aee574c0940640a8333dabd7b99af0d9891a1f7dae8;;;Any experience with Mental overclocking with adhd medication? (concerta) diagnoses: Aspergers, dyslexia and Adhd;;;I've been for the past year starting to use my adhd medication, despite the fact that I was diagnosed when I was 6.    I admit, taking the medication really helps my concentration and cognitive abilities, but lately, I've been thinking a lot of those times when I've accidentally taken too much. around 70+ mg of Concerta. What usually tends to happen is that an hour or two later, my cognitive abilities were going crazy and entered a trance of what I would refer to as "Mental Overclocking" It is just as it sounds. I was able to search for ANY form of information in my mind. Any word, any ekvation was at my disposal like a google search and I was significantly better at multi-tasking several different thoughts with accurate conclusions.    **KEEP IN MIND**: That it's not solely due to my adhd medication that I was able to achieve this level of mental and cognitive capability. I am also diagnosed with Aspergers and Dyslexia.    What I've noticed over the years is that my Aspergers helps me think and calculate on a unique level, which is similar if not completely like (depending the severity of their autism/aspergers). However, due to my other conditions such as Adhd and Dyslexia, I am unable to focus on a subject, save the information and use it when the time comes, you could say that my other diagnoses work together to repress my aspergers.    But when I take too much adhd medication, it completely nullifies any trace of my adhd and it also decreases if not completely removes my dyslexia while under the effect of mental overclocking. I remember very clearly that my personality was greatly changed and my brain was working without bounds in every sense of the word. There wasn't anything I couldn't learn, calculate or store in my brain. But that's also the side effect is that I would experience an inability to stop thinking, or as Cortana (halo 4) put it best. "Experience rampancy, where we literally think ourselves to death."     Though thankfully not to the same degree, I can distinctly remember that when I didn't read, watch or conversate, I was being VERY agitated by my mind's several multi-tasking thoughts that were constantly branching off like a hydra having its head cut off. One topic branches into two, two into four, four into eight ect. It required a heavy amount of control to stop this form of rampancy and I quickly hypothesized, theorised and confirmed that if I could focus on a topic with more effort than just background multi-tasking, then I could control the pain. I kept this up until the effect died down. I had a three day headache after that, a slight ache in my heart and intestines during the aftermath. It's been several months since then and I have kept my distance of medication due to the side-effects of "Mental overclocking"   I have to know if someone with the same diagnoses as me as experienced something similar if not entirely like this. Because I am starting university soon as an Electrical Engineer and I am curious to see if I could experiment further to see if I could not only control "Mental overclocking" by increasing my chemical tolerance, but also if it can be used as a potential treatment for people with the same diagnoses as myself. Adhd, Aspergers and Dyslexia (combined)  **P.S** sorry for wall of text, can't really find the format to put space between paragraphs.   **TL;DR** Have any of you ever experienced something similar with taking too much adhd medication? and if so, please be go into as much detail as you want. Any info is good info.  **UPDATE** Fml, after three hours of research, I found out that due to the combination of diagnosis with learning and processing information, I have NLD Nonverbal learning disorder. I am a perfect match for 90% of the symptoms. This makes me hypothesise that my medication is making me shed my restriction of NLD.
