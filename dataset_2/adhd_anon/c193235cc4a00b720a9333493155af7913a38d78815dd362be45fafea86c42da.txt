So, I think most of us here have dealt with depression in our lives, whether chronic or not. The problem with diagnosis on attention disorder is that depression does cause inattentiveness. I hope this thread/post might clear it up for some stragglers who are wondering if they have ADD or just severe depression.   With ADHD our focus is very "selective"(who's doing the selecting? fuck if i know). We could play a game for 10 hours straight, yet we couldn't sit down and write a 5 page essay without getting up every 10 or so minutes. When I got depression, I found that my focus on the things I like (such as drawing, music, and the like) was on the same level as focusing on a research paper. I couldn't even sit down and read for more than 5 minutes when I was depressed. There was no more joy in my life, and I found my focus everywhere and yet nowhere at once.   That was my experience dealing with depression and ADHD. I welcome anyone to share their experience if they want to. I know that this shit gets extremely complicated from time to time, but knowing the difference really does help (especially if you are suddenly not able to concentrate on your work more than usual).
