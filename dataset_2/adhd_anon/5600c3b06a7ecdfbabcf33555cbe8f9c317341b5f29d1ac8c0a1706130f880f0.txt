Anyone's input would be greatly appreciated, especially by me right now as I try not to freak out. Here's my piece:  It's going to be okay, and everything will get done, just breathe and organize your time like you know how to do. Don't stress too much about the big picture, just take each thing at a time and you'll get it all done. It's hard now but soon you will have turned everything in and taken all your tests, and then you can relax! Just keep going.
