Attributing that to the fact my title wasn't related to my actual question. Anyways finally met up with my psychiatrist today and he prescribed me adderall. Is it okay to tell important people I have been diagnosed or should I wait until the follow up appointment in a month. I'm not sure if the adderall will work but he must believe I have adhd which is why he prescribed me right? Or? Sorry I don't know if this is a dumb question.
