What are some experiences with effexor for ADHD-Inattentive?;;;I was on Adderall XR 25mg which worked really well for me but for some reason it only worked for about 4 to 6 hours. Not nearly long enough when I have a 12 hour work day plus school. My doctor and I talked about moving off of a stimulant to something that would work constantly throughout the day. Her first recommendation was Straterra 60mg twice a day and then 80mg twice a day. I have been on it for over a month with nothing but constipation and a serious lack of motivation(more so than usual). She is recommending the next step is to try out Effexor due to its promising results in some studies to treat ADHD-Inattentive symptoms. I was just wondering if anyone has gone through this type of situation and if so what was your experience on Effexor? Was it effective? Any really bad side-effects?   P.S. If all else fails we have already discussed moving back to stimulants  .
