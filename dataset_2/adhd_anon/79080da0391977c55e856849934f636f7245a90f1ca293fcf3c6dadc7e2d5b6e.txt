I've probably asked this a lot, but I made a text post for visibility, rather than a comment.   I've tried **Wellbutrin100**, **Strattera20**, **Concerta36**, and **adderall10** (all generic), with no success in keeping me focused, removing the fog, or memory retention.  My pdoc said Adderall was the last drug we could try, and it's given me some dismal results. What other medications are available?  Is there really a difference between medications that have the same formula? E.g. Vyvanse, concerta, Ritalin
