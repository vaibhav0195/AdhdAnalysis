A general discussion that will help many folks   II. My situation   (if it's too much text, just read first half) Please comment your experiences!  ----  I. There are countless reasons why many folks find it impossible or difficult to do what everyone knows is the ideal -- communicate fully with your doctor.  Possible Reasons many folks have limited ability to communicate with his/her doctor:  1. a. no health coverage; b. limited access to health services (e.g., few doctors or clinics in the area, long waits for appointments, when you do get to the appointment the doc is rushed, your doc doesn’t respond to calls regularly) 2. your current doctor isn’t one you feel you can communicate openly with. Possible reasons: a) she tells your parents everything; b) she thinks you want drugs to abuse them; c) she doesn’t believe you; d) you don’t trust her; e) she doesn't seem to care about you and/or you feel she doesn't care about the details/intricacies to treat you adaquately; f) and more 3. Your family, friends, or community has a bias towards seeking help, has narrow-minded views towards psychiatric care, thinks ADHD is fake, thinks medication=weakness or cheating, has religious views that apply to the subject, or any of those all-too-common obstacles 4. You have more than one doctor and have to figure out how to merge the care in the best way; you have multiple doctors that give you different or opposite feedback/advice 5. Your doctor insists something about you that you know isn't really truly what your situation is, and she is trying to treat you based on false premises   **For those of you that have had to deal with this, given the context that it is generally understood you should always “ask your doctor” (and similar discourse with this theme):**  1. What were your struggles? 2. What did you do? 3. What do you suggest for others in this situation?  ------- II. Part two, my situation that I'm struggling with.  I am currently studying in university and in a **transition** from the Psychiatrist I have been seeing since I was 15, which means seeing him is connected with my parents, and I want to become independent.   A Problem: he insists I have Bipolar Disorder I, but I don’t fit the criteria in the DSM-IV-TR because I had never had a Manic Episode.  I have had symptoms like: mood irregularity, times of deep depression, cyclical depression, anxiety, sleep troubles, cognitive problems, (and this psychiatrist said I had irritability that was close enough to being manic, but I disagree), and a few other symptoms, but upon my own analysis and self-evaluation and input from other pdocs, I think the more accurate term may be Mood Disorder NOS. I like this because it allows me and my doc to move past the labeling and move on to *treating the symptoms*.    The big problem I have now is that this old doc has prescribed me with an anti-psychotic since I was 15, and he insists that without one I will have a breakdown or manic episode or fail miserably at school and life or something, but my psychiatrist that I’ve recently started seeing through my university does not think my anti-psychotic (Latuda) is necessary, because I don't have Bipolar Disorder. I'M CONFUSED.  I am very greatful for my University Psychiatrist because she put the focus on treating my ADHD symptoms. She referred me to an ADHD specialist psychologist who diagnosed me with severe ADHD inattentive and hyperactive type (ADHD-C).  I have since just started a stimulant! (After long thinking one would help and being denied the chance to try it). My adolescence psychiatrist insisted that an ADHD stimulant would lead me to become manic, but he was wrong.  Adderall has helped me so much.  In addition to treating my ADHD symptoms, it has *improved my mood* and I have felt a humongous *decrease in anxiety* [I hardly use the Klonopin I was previously using often (~4 days/week)]. (Side note: I've always had a high pulse rate, ~111+ resting, but since starting Adderall my pulse has GONE DOWN.)  This points to the conclusion that my mood problems and all that were symptoms of my severe and untreated ADHD.  It seems as though my inability to concentrate, focus on school and socially and with my parents, inability to complete assignments and tasks, etc--were actually the root of my mood problems and anxiety and all that.  But the problem: I currently take Latuda, Lamictal, Strattera, Adderall.  I have no idea if the anti-psychotic and/or the mood-stabilizer is necessary. It's a **major dilemma** because I am in university and I'm taking summer school and will not have a break that is over 1 week until Christmas break, which is only like 3 weeks, then I don't know when I'll have a long break. POINT: if I stop taking one of these either a) superfluous, b) potentially  harmful, or c) absolutely necessary to my stability;  and it turns out it's 'c', then I'll get screwed over in my school work and stuff and possibly suffer really crappy lame stuff.  My adolescence pdoc insists I will break down if I stop taking them, and my new pdoc is pretty sure that I don't need them, but she isn't sure (maybe because she's known me less time) and says it's up to me. Relevant: I have had periods in my life where I had hallucinations.  So adolescence pdoc claims these will return if I cease the anti-psychotic.  HALP. What do I do????  **TL; DR: Just read 'I. A general discussion that will help many folks' AND please comment with your experiences  :) **    Edit: your vs you're; lol
