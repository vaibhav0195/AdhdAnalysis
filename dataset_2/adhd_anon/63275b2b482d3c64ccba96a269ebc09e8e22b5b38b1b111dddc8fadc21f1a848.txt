Hey /r/ADHD!  I just started my 4th year of college (I'm a music major and a transfer student so I'm a bit behind from everybody else) and I was really hoping to find a person that want to make a change/improve their life/control the crazy just like I am so that we can hold each other accountable. I've tried real life friends in the past, but none of them have ADHD so they don't quite understand what it's like. If I'm crazy and this is a stupid idea or there's already a place for this, let me know  I'm talking a bit of a personal relationship where we make sure that neither of us start slacking off and letting the tendencies take over. My semesters usually start off great, I'm focused and I make sure to stay on top of everything, but within a few weeks I start slacking off, missing assignments, cutting down on practice time, stop working out, etc., an d then in the end of the semester I realize how much I've screwed myself and I work extremely hard to catch up. I need someone to help me stay on track so that I don't have the mid-semester slack and the end rush, and I figure that someone that understands would be best. We would stay in contact and make sure that the other is still being a good, productive person.  I'd prefer a student buddy, but anyone would be great! Just send me a message and we can exchange information. Even better, if you're in the Bloomington/Normal area in Illinois we could meet irl to really make sure that the guilt stays.  EDIT: Thanks guys! We can all be besties.
