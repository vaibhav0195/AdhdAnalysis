My grades aren't the best and i know if i can just concentrate i would be able to do really great. I've just heard so many bad things about adderall and other amphetamines. A majority of the stories i have read online talk about how the medication had ruined their lives and how their tolerance just keeps rising to unhealthy levels. Also Requiem for a Dream really creeped me out as well.   So from your experience is it worth it? Bonus question: How did you deal with the tolerance?  Edit1: Thanks a lot guys- it just really freaked me out when i read all those stories online and was just scared about if the doctor might have just over diagnosed me or something. I guess i'll go for a trial run- any idea's on what to take and at what dosage?
