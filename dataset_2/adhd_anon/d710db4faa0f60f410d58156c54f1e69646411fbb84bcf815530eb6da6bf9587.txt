Was put on Ritalin IR 3 times daily for two weeks, but it was a rollercoaster of ups and downs for me. Told my psychiatrist about this and he wrote me up on Concerta 54mg.  So far the effect seems very similar. No ups and downs, yet I am still very tired when I come home around 4pm. Too tired to do anything productive with my time (which is basically why i began treatment in the first place.).  I'd like to know from those of you who use Concerta, how were you around 4pm in terms of energy? Is this feeling a part of the package?
