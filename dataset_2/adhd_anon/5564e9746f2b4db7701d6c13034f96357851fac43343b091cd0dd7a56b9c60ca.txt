5564e9746f2b4db7701d6c13034f96357851fac43343b091cd0dd7a56b9c60ca;;;So I have a far above average intelligence but on a severity scale my ADHD is about as worse as it can be and I feel like wasted potential. I fucked up my GPA to the point I feel as if I will never know what to do. Oh and I dropped out on my 12th year which was my 2nd year in grade 11....;;;Seriously; my ADHD is so bad that the last psychiatrist holding a phd that I consulted seemed surprised at the level of inattentiveness present and this was on a good day 3 hours after taking my daily 60mg of Lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse) so my symptoms were better than when I'm not medicated. She told me when we were reviewing my psych evaluation that "You are far above the average man in terms of intelligence but your inattentiveness associated with your ADHD is by far one of the worst I have seen in my career" and she also said "without ADHD you would top the charts on an IQ test although because on the psych evaluation the attentiveness results are so low despite everything else indicating a high intelligence I don't believe an IQ test can accurately rate your intelligence due to the discrepancies in attentiveness". Seriously for fucks sake; I'm depressed off my ass because I feel like wasted potential (I am actually diagnosed with Major Depression Disorder; Melancholic and cyclical subtype), I have moderate GAD, Social Phobia, and Panic Disorder, Agoraphobia, not as in a fear of crowds but rather a tendency to develop a Panic Attack when in a location where I have previously had a panic attack or when I think about a location I have had a Panic Attack. Well to sum it up I'm not happy with my life and feel like wasted potential but even on days That ADHD chooses not to manifest as bad my crippling anxiety keeps me from getting shit done. What do? Any advice..... I would hate to just get disability an give up on doing something for the world.
