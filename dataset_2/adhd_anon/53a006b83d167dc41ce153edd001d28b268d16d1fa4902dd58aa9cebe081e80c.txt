I'm going to be taking some intro to Computer Science with the intention of focusing on programming. Computers are the one thing I have more knowledge about than anything else and this feels like my last route to try to make something for my self. I was diagnosed with ADHD in 7th grade and am now after several years all through schooling of being on and off again on all sorts of medicines back to being medicated for this "last ditch" effort at going to school again. Soooo  **TL;DR** -  I've heard some people say that Programming is a good career for others that have ADHD or ADD. (I'm assuming that is for someone with the condition and being treated)  I was wondering why that is?  If anyone of you have ADHD/ADD and are programmers?  How long and hard was it for you to learn?  Do you have tips for someone interested in going to school for programming?  What can I do to get a head start as someone with no prior knowledge on the subject?
