Also a tip to summarizing!;;;I started     18 mg concerta 2 months ago  Switched to 36 mg concerta 1 month ago  Until today, **I didn't notice any improvement** so I decided (yes, without consulting my dr who is on vacation and who I can't see before the 20th of January 2014) to take 2 x 36 mg  this morning and I can't believe the difference.   **I was struggling at university with non technical courses** where you have to actually read the book to understand the subject. I am **studying accounting in Quebec** and i am doing very good with accounting classes because i love it and try to understand it through analogies and trying to think of cases where it can be applied. However, I am having trouble with administration courses ( management, human resources, marketing etc...)  There is one class which **I dropped 3 times** because I just couldn't get myself to read past the first 2 pages of the book. I tried hundreds of times but I was struggling to understand what I was reading, **it felt like there is a hole in my head through which words just escaped before I could register them**.   **Today I was determined to finish the first chapter once and for all**. All previous and different approaches failed so **I just took 2 pills** and and 30 minutes later something weird happened   * **Peace!** * My internal monologue stopped  * Everything was so calm * I got up, got my book and actually read the first page and I actually enjoyed it! * I enjoyed it! * 3 hours later, I finished the first chapter( 27 pages, not much, i know,  but it is a giant leap for me)   * I was also able to summarize, as I was reading, key points which will help me to study for the final  * I am feeling great and I can't wait to finish the 2nd chapter!!   **Tip: I did the summary by following this technique**  * 1) You ask a question ( usually you will find it in the course's objective which is generally divided into weeks or classes).   * 2) You answer the question by adding definitions, arguments, examples etc..  * 3) You summarize the answer in a way that will make it easier to put you in context in order to remember all the above key points.   **Doing this is important because what is the point of reading everything if you can't remember anything.**   This is the summary: http://imgur.com/0NEOSrm
