1be8c744ec1d09e5781606dd3b19e33d51734ba37b760ba28de1c1124a09bd54;;;Waiting to get fired because I fucked up and didn't deal. I am literally in limbo. Please help me!!!;;;I am sitting in my office very seriously just waiting to get fired. My supervisor said she had to meet with the senior team to see about the termination of my position and that in the meantime I had to do a few things. That was at 9am. It is now 1pm. I am still waiting. I am working on my grad school application (nothing like the fear of unemployment to get me to finish my application) and I feel like I am in hell.  I went on vacation this week and simply forgot to tell ANYONE that I would be gone the whole week. I seriously forgot. I mentioned i would be gone monday and tuesday but FORGOT ABOUT THE REST OF THE WEEK.  Now you may ask yourself how could I have forgotten such an important task. I have been asking myself that same question and I JUST DON'T KNOW. 3 missed workdays are a good reason for termination. I am about to get fired from a job I love.  I don't know what i did, i don't know what to do. I even thought how great it would've been to get in a car accident as I was driving to the office this morning. I am fucked.  EDIT: The HR person is not in the office today so they told me that we would talk tomorrow and figure out what needed to happen then. I almost wish I would've been fired, now I get to go home and wonder whether i will get fired tomorrow or now.
