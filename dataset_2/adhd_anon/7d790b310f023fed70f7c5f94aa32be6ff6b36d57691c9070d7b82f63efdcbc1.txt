7d790b310f023fed70f7c5f94aa32be6ff6b36d57691c9070d7b82f63efdcbc1;;;Mentally exhausted...;;;I don't know why or how I do this to myself everyday, but I'm just mentally exhausted. Everyday I have to constantly fight myself just to do ANY work at work. It always feels like its round 12 in a boxing match and Im just fighting my own lack of motivation. I physically FEEL (minor pain in my stomach when I think about doing work) the disappointment, lack of motivation/discipline to do any work. I feel worthless, annoyed, drained, lazy, bored, etc. Maybe its the job itself (office job, but wasnt much different when I worked in construction), or maybe its not. Either way its slowly killing me inside. Some moments I can find the motivation to do some work, most times I can't. Yet I can't even find the motivation to find a new job. My mind just cant/wont. Mentally Im in constant purgatory, just going along in this depressing routine. Feel stuck. I only ever feel this at work. Im mentally unable, due to (diagnosed) anxiety, to find a new career anyways.   I don't know what to do at this point. This daily routine is slowly killing me, and I probably have to wait another week to even be approved for the Adhd test I was recommend for. Sorry for the mini-rant, but I feel like just walking away from work and never coming back, and that Ill honest to God never find a job I enjoy (all while juggling finances).   Im so sick of it all, I don't know if this physical feeling of lack of motivation is ADHD or not, but fuck me it sucks so bad.  Even mental "tricks" (lists, just count to five and do it, etc.) dont work as I cant even find the motivation to do those. I just dont get it. I feel like Im even worse than most of those with ADHD on this sub, like Im mentally on a tier even below most of other people with ADHD.
