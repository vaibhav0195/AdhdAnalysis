I had one appointement so far. At first it was ok, but telling embarrassing stuff about myself quickly drained me out. I tried to add a little bit of humor to make it less overwhelming, but I think it was a bad idea, because the absence of reaction from the psychiatrist made me feel even more uncomfortable. In the end, I was making lapsuses, having blanks, being inprecise, talking like a 5 yo... I felt very ridiculous, and when she said "ok we're done" and left her office without saying goodbye, I felt totally worthless. I know, I have a very low self esteem.  I have another appointement in a few days. It's going to be another interview, and it's going to be around 3 times as long as last time. I don't know how I'm going to make it, if I zone out or go blank again after just a few minutes... It's going to be horrifying. I gave her some written stuff about me last time to counter this risk but she'd rather not use it.  TLDR; How do you handle telling embarrassing stuff about yourself during long diagnosis appointements? I quickly zone out and start being nervous and imprecise.
