I'm very creative and love to create stuff. Except my ADHD decides that it will make me feel horrible each and every day. When i start a project i think to myself "I'm gonna finish this!", i'll think of all the cool things and while i'm doing everyday activities i'll think about what it will be like. But what happens is, if i'm lucky i'll actually work on the project and work on it for a day/week and then i will either, 1. Finish it but it's all sloppy and not even 30% done. 2. Which basically always happens, i'll forget about it and when i see it i'll think "Oh cool." and never work on it again. This repeats basically every week and i am sick and tired of it. School doesn't help either. I get home at 4:20pm and put myself to bed at 10:30pm. But to me time goes by a hour every minute, making me very mad and sometimes hitting my table. It also doesn't help thinking about how i will never ever make any difference. I'll never make a hit game, i'll never make a good song, i'll never try. Sometimes if i get homework i'll just shove it in my desk so i don't have to work on it at home giving me more time to work and fail. I don't know what to do... I know you guys will be like "Oh, just train yourself" but that doesn't help. It actually can make me worse because i'll know that i can't even try to do that because i'll fail. TL;DR: I can't finish projects, and when i do they suck. Time also goes really fast. What do i do?
