Medication has really helped me a lot. But ever since I was diagnosed my father's wife has been increasingly judgmental and patronizing to me. She repeatedly wants to start discussions with me about ADHD, suggesting it's a behavioral problem and something caused by my (and everyone else diagnosed with it) being "immature". It's not just that she doubts I have it, she says it doesn't exist. Recently I confronted her about this (after she sent me a pseudo-scientific article supporting her claim), and told her how telling me my mental disorder is simply bad behavior is hurtful and ignorant, and now she is the victim, even though I swear on my mother's grave I was being respectful. How do I educate her and help her realize how she can't go on like this while still staying on her good side? This is my first post on Reddit, so I'm sorry if my question is confusing and all over the place.
