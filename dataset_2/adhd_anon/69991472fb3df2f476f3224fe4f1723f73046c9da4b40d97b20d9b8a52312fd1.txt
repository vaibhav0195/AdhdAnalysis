For example, now that I'm medicated, I:  – Always carry a water bottle and make sure I refill it as soon as it's empty. I probably drink at least a gallon of water if I'm doing it right.  – Plan my meals nightly before bed so I can make sure I end up eating enough. Especially since I'm trying to bulk, I have to integrate meals into my daily schedule because my hunger cues are non-existent. I don't think I'll have a very hard time cutting :)  – Brush my teeth four times a day. Like my meals, this is scheduled throughout the day. I knew dry mouth was a side effect, but I did not expect the resultant ass-breath.  – Have become a habitual gum-chewer. I never chewed gum before my diagnosis, but again, ass-breath.  – Have learned what is and isn't appropriate to talk to strangers about. I was friendly before, but at this point, cranky folks better hope they don't encounter me at the bus stop. Nobody is immune to my extraversion.  – Struggle not to overshare. I don't want to be typecast as "ADHD guy" in my circles, and I definitely don't want people to start snooping about my prescriptions. But as far as I can tell, my ADHD is a huge part of the person I am and the person I will be until I die. I also don't want other undiagnosed people to suffer. I still haven't figured out if it's something I should hide or something I should share.  – Actually do the things I set out to do every day. Okay, so this isn't a side effect, but it totally makes the rest of it worth it :)  What changes have you made in your life to work with the side effects of your medications?
