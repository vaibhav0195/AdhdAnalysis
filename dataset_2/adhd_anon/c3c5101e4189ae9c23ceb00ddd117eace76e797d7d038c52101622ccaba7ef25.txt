Now that I've been diagnosed, I feel kinda sensitive about my associated faults, like I know what's wrong with me  and I don't need them throwing it in my face.  One of our friends is manic, and we don't give him shit for it, we care for his well being.  One is dyslexic, and sure we laugh when he mixes stuff up but if he ever sincerely asked me to stop, damn right I would.  But I don't feel like ADHD is that "real" to them, and my complaining about it may honestly egg them on.    So, how can I make a group of male-humor friends relate/understand/stfu effectively?
