She keeps telling me to "train it away" or "work with it". I keep saying that I can't control it, I'm not doing it on purpose and she keeps telling me to stop blaming my diagnosis because she knows other people with ADHD and they don't do it. It saddens me that she do not understand that I can't help myself. Have anyone else had similar problems? I don't know what to do, because I'm so tired of fighting about it, it just makes me sad..
