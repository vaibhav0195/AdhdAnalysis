I understand that if you have a low activity day, you might get uncomfertable because the extra energy in your body isnt used up.  But I can sleep on a 20 mg dose - like take 20 mg and go to sleep and sleep like a little baby.  But i can also take 20 mg in the morning an feel uncomfortable and speedy in my body.  I have been taking ritalin since late october 2014 - so i am new to this. I am 24. woman.
