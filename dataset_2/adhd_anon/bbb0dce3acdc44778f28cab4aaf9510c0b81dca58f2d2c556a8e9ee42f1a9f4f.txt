bbb0dce3acdc44778f28cab4aaf9510c0b81dca58f2d2c556a8e9ee42f1a9f4f;;;What was your first two weeks on Strattera like?;;;I'm 39, I was diagnosed about a year and a half ago. Adderall made me feel like a zombie and Ritalin gives me palpitations and anxiety.   I have a slight heart murmur and I suffer from bad anxiety and ocd, I have a constant fear of dying while I'm on the stimulants.   I was a bit depressed because my adhd put me in a bad position business wise and I racked up a lot of debt.  I started the Strattera  and it kind of cheered me up the first week was good but it hurt when I ejaculated.   It calmed down my anxiety and helped with my depression a bit though. I'm on day 12 and my anxiety has really kicked up, I increased the dose on the 7th day from 40mg to 80mg. I feel wired with no focus and I'm getting palpitations.    I just feel really weird and shitty on this stuff, like it's not doing anything for my adhd . I asked the doctor for Vyvanse but he told me it's like adderrall and would feel the same way.    I'm thinking about giving up on meds all together, which sucks because ADHD is really fucking up my life.
