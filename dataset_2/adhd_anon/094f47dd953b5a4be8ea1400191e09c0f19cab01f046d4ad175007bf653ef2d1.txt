Thoughts?;;;Yesterday I told my GP the Adderall XR was going okay side-effect-wise, but I still haven't seen many differences.  He wondered (again) if he made the wrong diagnosis. He said that if I do have adhd, I should *immediately* be seeing benefits with *any* medication. We've only tried Concerta and Adderall XR, which have ranged from no effect to feeling pretty bad. He said this after the Concerta, too.  He renewed the Adderall xr anyway and referred me to a psychiatrist, but the waitlist could take several months. I'd be happy to see a specialist, but if the wait is that long I'm probably going to have huge problems with next semester and my externship.  My school case manager who, to be fair, isn't a doctor, said it can take several tries to find one that works, and anxiety could be covering any benefits it might have. I told him I worried a lot about whether I actually had it or if it was just my own doing. He said a lot of the time that's caused by negative self talk, and while it's true there's no "objective" signs someone has it, doctors have different opinions on it too.  Really I just feel frustrated and awful. No matter how hard I push myself I can't keep any routines or get anything done and I am trying my absolute hardest to pay attention to people speaking, but I can't. I'm not even aware of when I've lost my focus. I keep going back and forth between "it's just my own fault, I'm lazy" and feeling like something is really wrong with how my brain works.  **tl;dr** Tried 2 different meds with little to no effect, doc says if I really do have ADHD I should have had an immediate benefit. Seems okay with keeping me on Adderall xr but is hesitant to try others despite Adderall xr not doing much. Anyone experience this and what should I do?
