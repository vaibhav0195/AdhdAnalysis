9e447c0b01a3bdbbe4958adb4b0e183bbcd9dfd79d572dd81e728df9109f2103;;;A nice story for once;;;So I go to cooking school and am in a team of 4 people working with the rest of my class in the restaurant kitchen if my school. Yesterday was a complete shit show at our station on the part of another member of my team (who has a language barrier but no known adhd) and I while the two neurotypical members were serving customers out front, without them to support us. Chef gave us shit during service and held our team back after class to talk to us further.   I have mentioned my ADHD to one of the two neurotypical members of my team in the past and she has been non-judgmental about it. After yesterday we got talking on Facebook and at first she was saying things like "you can't blame everything on your ADHD" and "don't use it as a crutch", and my first thought was "don't you dare fucking judge me without having lived in my shoes!" but I calmed myself down and made an effort to educate her as she is really a nice person who I like, reminding myself of two things: 1. Never attribute to malice what can be explained by ignorance, and 2. (a personal rule of mine) When you feel strongly about something, plead instead of threaten.  So I told her "Please please don't say things like that without trying to learn about it first. You don't understand". And we kept talking about it, and lo and behold she shared an "ADHD simulator" YouTube video with me, and then later an article on Additude Magazine about a well-known ADHD chef!! This made me cry from happiness cause I was *not* expecting a seemingly neurotypical person to actually take the time to try to learn and understand me and my issues and I told her so and sent her hugs and thanked her. I feel better about the whole situation now.   TL;DR: Not all people are assholes who refuse to listen to us and learn about us! Faith in humanity (somewhat) regained!
