I have reason to believe that I have mono, and I was wondering any of you knew how taking concerta affects the recovery process. I'm currently taking 27 mg on weekdays and some weekends, and it has single-handed changed my life when if comes to school. I'm in a challenging first year program and I'm worried that since concerta is a stimulant it'll be detrimental to my health since mono is treated by basically taking it easy and bedrest. On the other hand, I can't afford to take time off from my meds (and by extension, school) if I want to remain in my program. There is very little chance of me being able to catch up on weeks worth of material if do I need to take a break. I tried to see if I could manage without meds last semester and it was totally unmanageable. With the extra fatigue of being sick I'm not feeling too great about my chances of finishing this year.  I'm so fucking frustrated. I've always had trouble with school and I felt like I was finally starting to hit my stride this year because I finally got diagnosed with ADHD (over the summer) and I was learning to deal with it properly so I could study things that actually interest me and I've been the happiest I've ever been in my life these past few months... but health comes first.  TL:DR : pretty sure I have mono, will I be able to keep taking my meds and keep up with school or am I going to be forced to drop out?
