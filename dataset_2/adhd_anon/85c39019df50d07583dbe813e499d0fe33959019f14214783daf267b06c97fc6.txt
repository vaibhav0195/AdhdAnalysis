I think I found the does I need, either 10mg IR of Adderall or 20mg ER of Adderall, depending on how long I need to be productive on any given day.   Anyways, about a third of the time, whenever I take my meds (or 100% of the time I drink coffee) I get a "you need to take a nap as soon as humanly possible" feeling.   Do any of you guys get this with any type of stimulant? Do you all know why? I tried googling and couldn't find anything.
