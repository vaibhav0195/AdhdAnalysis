Been working on getting diagnosed for a while, got the run around, etc. Currently waiting to hear back from just my regular dr about setting up a 'telehealth' video call with a psych, because i live in the middle of nowhere. I just found online that there is a psych about 45 mins away from me, and I've been waiting for over a week to hear back from my regular doc...should I call the other office? It specifically says on their site they do Adult ADHD testing, sooooo I think that may be best?  TL;DR - Continue waiting (1 week+ already) for regular doctor to set up video conference psych, or just go to one 45 minutes away that I know does the testing?
