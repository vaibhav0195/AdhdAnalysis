This subreddit community has helped me so much and I gained my courage to go through the process because of you guys.   I went to Kaiser in LA, spoke to a social worker, got referred to a psychiatrist and was prescribed 150mg Bupropion HLC XL (Wellbutrin) once a day. I kept hearing horror stories of dragged out experiences in CA Kaisers, but I had a really nice experience that spanned two weeks and two visits.   Funny part was I asked my doc if he knew about reddit and he did. Told him about this subreddit :P     I originally didn't want a non-stimulant or anti depressant, but my psychiatrist said it would help with my anxiety and to quit smoking.  I know it takes awhile for the effects of Bupropion to work, and I'm on day 2, but I've noticed a huge clarity, vividness, and crisp feeling on it. The thing is, my ADHD is worse so far. I zone out far more often and I can't pay attention to anything. I also fall asleep easily during the day on it, which I don't think is supposed to happen, and I wake up feeling really dazed.      Will Bupropion's effect change and mature as I use it more? I'm going to ask for Adderall XR next, what difference can I expect compared to Bupropion?
