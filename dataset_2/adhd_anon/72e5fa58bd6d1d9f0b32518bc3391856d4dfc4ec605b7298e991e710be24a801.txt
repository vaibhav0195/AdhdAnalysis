Without thinking about it I turned up the radio because I was distracted by the song. This understandably offended her because she was in the middle of talking and when she asked why I turned the radio up I didn't understand why it was such an issue because I checked out and thought she was done talking.  We argued for the rest of the car ride because I thought she was done and she knew that she was in the middle of a sentence. It was until about 20 minutes after I realized it was obviously because I wasn't on my meds that day and my ADHD got the best of me.  I don't get offended when someone yells "SQUIRREL" at me or makes some other ADHD joke. It makes me feel more human actually, I really enjoy it. But I think if people believe their mental disorder isn't well understood or appreciated they should try living with ADHD because I just assume nobody will understand or care if I say I have ADHD.  Having ADHD has ruined parts of my life and I haven't even realized it until now because I couldn't. It can be an extremely severe condition and nobody feels any sympathy when you say you have it because nobody understands how damaging it can truly be.
