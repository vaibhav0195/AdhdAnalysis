e88ab1c2e481313e75962423b4d6e2fafee14329df7a392a7a0cd43e2037fbc4;;;After a 3 month process, I've been told I don't have ADHD;;;i don't know what to do. I've thought I've had ADHD for 5 years. I tried a few times to get help, but this is the first time I made it to the point of evaluation. Three months of appointments, questionnaires, and computer tests and I just get told that my concentration and memory issues aren't severe enough for a diagnoses.  I'm completely disheartened.  I struggle with basic things. I tune out in class and during conversations all the time. I have bad working memory and even worse long term memory. I don't have any specific interests. I'm not good or knowledgeable about anything because I can't sustain interest. I struggle to get good grades at the expense of a lot of things and perhaps partly due to the fact that I get good grades, I'm not believed when I tell people I think I have ADHD.  What kind of life is this? How am I supposed to take care of myself when I struggle with every aspect of day to day living such that it affects my school work, job, and floundering social life?  My last hope was that trying medication might help and now I feel hopeless. Nobody believes me. Nobody thinks I'm struggling.
