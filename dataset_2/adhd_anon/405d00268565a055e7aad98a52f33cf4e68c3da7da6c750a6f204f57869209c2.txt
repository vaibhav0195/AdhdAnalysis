However, even though I am doing much better at school it comes at a toll of my social life...   I wake up late, I have become quite emotionless nor do I care about others as much.  When I self-medicated, it was like a light bulb came on in my head and everything took 1/2 the time. I actually teared up knowing how insane it was to be able to focus without having constant thoughts coming into my mind  My question is : do you guys feel like it's a cheat code? I have heard the analogy of a person not wearing their glasses and that of a diabetic...
