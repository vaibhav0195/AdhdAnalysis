I was never diagnosed but there is surely something very wrong with my attention. If i try to follow the same amount of things as normal people, my brain overheats and it goes into blank state where i cant even understand whan everyone is telling me. I do not know the meaning of sounds they are making with their mouths, i do not know what the hell am i suppose to be doing right know and i would screw up even making a sandwich. If i keep numer of things i need to take care of at once to a minimum i manage, but i started to think i should get some help, becouse i cant even ride a bike without risk of forgetting that im riding it and crashing into wall. If i was to seek medical help, what are side effects of drugs that help with that? I may be very misinformed, but i am afraid of looking like meth addict in 15 years. How do you feel after long time of taking meds? Thanks.  TL;DR: will i look like jagger after 15 years of taking meds
