df494b9e84bc0b8797710faa46f493e69238e1e5090f6b58b92128ebe6c43f9d;;;Are you happy?;;;Ever since I was around 16/17 and the once distant world of adulthood and responsibility started to become a reality, I have felt like I will never be happy.   Whether it was due to feeling 'different' or 'on another level' to most people because of ADHD, I've always had this underlying belief deep down that things would never go my way in life, even when I am actually feeling really happy and optimistic about things. Is it something that is ingrained in me because of my constant underachievement in life, or is it an actual emotional symptom of ADHD?   It's not depression because I've been through that and I know what it feels like, it's more like a pessimism. But (like a lot of symptoms that we have due to ADHD), this pessimism isn't who I really am. I am generally a very positive person with a lot going for me, so I know that I shouldn't have this feeling inside of me. So it makes me wonder if it's an emotional fault in my brain that is characteristic of ADHD, and if so, is it common? Sometimes I think it's because of the constant noise in my head due to ADHD, because I guess that's basically the opposite of what people call inner peace.  So I guess my question is:   Are you truly happy?   Or does ADHD make you constantly feel like you will never be at peace with yourself?
