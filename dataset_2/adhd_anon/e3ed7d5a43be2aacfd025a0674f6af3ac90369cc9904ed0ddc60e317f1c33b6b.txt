He prescribed a stimulant to me, and I've been doing stellar ever since.    The prescription the doctor put me on is Vyvanse, which is a schedule II drug, which means I have to have regular appointments to receive new prescriptions.  I recently moved to a new city 3.5 hours from my old town.  I know I'll need to find a new doctor here, but will I also have to be re-diagnosed, or can the old doctor send the information over?  Anyone have experience with a situation like this?
