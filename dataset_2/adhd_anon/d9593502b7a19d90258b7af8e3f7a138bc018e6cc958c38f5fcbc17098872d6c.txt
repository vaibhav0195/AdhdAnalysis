I fell off the medication/treatment train when I was around 17-18. I was always kind of socially reclusive because of other things that are too complicated to go into here.   However, I have become very adept in social situations in the past 2-4 years (I'm 25 now). My only problems are forming complete thoughts fast enough to keep up with conversation (I'm damn good at quick, short wit though) and my confidence (due to those complicated things I mentioned earlier). Overall, I'm fairly sociable and can hold my own in a crowd. Hell, I've been known to steal the spotlight from time to time when I have high energy.   I am a shameless flirt, but I don't flirt much. I'll make small jokes here and there and do stuff like say "Well that's adorable. The dress is cute too. ;)" or something along those lines. However, I seem to be rather dense when it comes to noticing that I'm being flirted with or if I have a girl's attention. Most of the time, my mind is focused on what I need to be doing, so when I break away from that to flirt, I go right back to what I was doing otherwise it'll never get done. Sometimes I'm so focused on what I'm doing, I don't even know if someone's in the same room as me, let alone if they're outright flirting with me.   Does this happen to anyone else? I feel like I can't be the only one.
