(;;;Basically I want to figure out if I have add/adhd you know like a simple yes I have it or no I don't, so my parents referred me to a therapist and I have gone once and she just asked me about family stuff like how's your relationship with so and so and she never even asked about my concentration or anything having to do with adhd and at the end she was like ok see you next week but I didn't even feel like we accomplished anything. Can I just go to a psychiatrist and them like give me a test?
