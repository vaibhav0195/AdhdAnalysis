d572e75d475d28a5fd1a4be948cebfc1458e19709c2e34fafd23661973060aca;;;Today was a hard day for me.;;;I broke down a little and cried. I have been off of adderall for almost a year and a half. In this time, I gained 30lbs, my anxiety cane back and I have been dealing with all the other symptoms that come with being ADHD. I was only managing. So I went i to the dr yesterday for a prescription. Today I was debating filling it. Everyone was out of stock and I finally found a walgreens 20miles away that had some. I still wasn't sure if this was the right choice. I wanted to be "normal" and not depend on a drug. As im waiting for it to be filled I went to go pick up my daughter and run errands. This is when I notice my debt. Card has gone missing. Im frantic as I know for a fact I just had it. So im assuming it fell out somewhere. I cancel the card and go to my nearest bank for a replacement after an hour of searching the car. Im walking back to my car and i scratch my leg through my stretchy running capris. Thats when I feel it. Somehow, while driving all around town, I slid my card into the leg of my capris. I literally had the card on me the entire time. Who in the hell does that? This was my confirmation that I need the meds. Im tired of feeling like a hot, jumbled mess. Im ready to feel like a person again.  This whole thing was a hard realization that if I don't take control and accept help, I will do these things forever.
