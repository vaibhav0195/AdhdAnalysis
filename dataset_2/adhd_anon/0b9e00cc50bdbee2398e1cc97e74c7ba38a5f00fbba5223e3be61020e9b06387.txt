I've been recently diagnosed and was given 40mg Strattera to start my treatment. Today is my very first day on the med.   The doctors basically told me that a small dose like what I'm taking should have basically no positive effects at all, and the first real differences will come in a month time after we double the dose.  Today I managed to do everything I like to do in the morning (meditate, eat breakfast, prepare lunch, brush theet) without forgetting anything, and came to work early.   This NEVER happens. Is it just placebo effect or is the med already kicking in? Either way, this is a very good morning :)
