After failed attempts of trying to cure depression or cope with nonexistent Asperger's I have a concrete enemy I can fight against. Except the diagnosis was long, and ate all me money - and for the next few months I won't have the needed cash for therapy. Don't want to use medication for now.  I'm in desperate need of methods how to cope with loss of concentration. I'm talking about the case (dunno if it's common) where you're trying to focus on something, and it sort of slips away from your grasp. And all energy you put into it gets wasted, only makes you more tired and irritated that you can't do a simple task. The problems it generates for me are huuge.  So, are there any methods you'd recommend? Books to read? Or won't I be able to tackle this problem unless I take meds?  TL;DR: I can't cope with loss of concentration and it's destroying me.
