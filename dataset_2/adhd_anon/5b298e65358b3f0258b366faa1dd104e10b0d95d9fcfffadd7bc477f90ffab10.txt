5b298e65358b3f0258b366faa1dd104e10b0d95d9fcfffadd7bc477f90ffab10;;;Moved to UK (from Caribbean) and want to restart medication.;;;I was diagnosed when I was 11 in the US (now 18) and was briefly on meds but parents decided I should wait till I'm older for me to make the decision myself. I'm at university and have been struggling so I went to my GP the other day and was told I would have to be reassessed and it could take months. Anything I could do? I could get a letter and prescription from my doctor back in the Caribbean as I regularly go back but would this help?
