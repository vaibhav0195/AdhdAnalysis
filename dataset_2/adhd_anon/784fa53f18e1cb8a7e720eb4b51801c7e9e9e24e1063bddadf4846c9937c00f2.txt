I've been diagnosed with ADHD of some sort by my PCP, most likely PI or C. I've been on medication for almost a year. Previously Strattera, which had too many side effects, and currently Adderall XR which I've handled much better. I'm at 20 mg in the morning only and I'm doubtful a medication increase would do much at this point, though I could be wrong. I'm more interested in counseling/coaching at this point since I just cried and hollered at my poor mom for the last hour since I just found out I failed a licensing exam for my profession. I've failed other licensing exams previously, which is how I came to the diagnosis in the first place at the age of 25.      Anyways, I'm looking at a list of counselors in the area and frankly don't know what I need to be looking for. CBT seems to come up a lot, but is there anything else I should look for? Or would trying to find a psychiatrist be better? (Very difficult in the area, have tried and failed to previously)  TL;DR: What should I look for in a counselor for ADHD? Or should I just find a psychiatrist?
