I have an app (ios) called expenseFree that i am using to track all spending, i have hung my neatly written out budget on the back of my bedroom door, and i'm still worried about spending too much on the next "shiny" that comes along - i have two goals to work on saving towards, but still....shiny  (goals:  new laptop, newer (not dead) car).  Any advice?  how do you keep on track?

They say they are adhd, they /act/ unmedicated - always moving, always talking, always bouncing etc.  i know its not their fault.  but it messes with both my anxiety and slightly my adhd - something is moving near/behind me i need to know what it is (maybe thats just hypervigiliance).    how do you handle this?  Its a call center, so i have to be focused.  i am medicated.  but if he is, he's not on a high enough dosage /or/ he needs to take it before work (our shifts are from 5p to as late as midnight, i work 5p-11p).  one night he was doing squats in the aisle (you're supposed to stay in your cubicle all shift).  i feel like its not a good fit of a job for him (he also cannot stay on script)  TL;DR  How to handle an unmedicated adhd coworker in a call center?
