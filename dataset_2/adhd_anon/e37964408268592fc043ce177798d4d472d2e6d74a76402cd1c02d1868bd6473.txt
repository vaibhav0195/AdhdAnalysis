I have problems I observed since young. I went to a GP today asking for a referal to psychiatrist about my issues. He said that it was near impossible for me to have ADHD because "if you had it, it would have been detected earlier." Also, had I have it, I wouldn't have gotten into my pretty decent high school. But that's the fucking problem! I tried to explain that it likely would have been due to the fact that ADHD-PI is harder to spot and many adults only get diagnosed when they're much much older, which is why I suspected I had an issue. He also said that my school cousellor and teachers hadn't said anything about it or even suspected it, thus it was unlikely.  Honestly, can we really count on every teacher in the american school system to know these things? I'm just really sick of this all my underachieving, and I really think I can do better than running late for apointments I woke up four hours early for, forgetting to lock the door, leaving my keys in the fridge, losing friends because I blurt out stupid things, being a fucking drag during conversations because I can't remember the damn topic! I got my referral but I'm mad.  TLDR doctor doubts me because im apparently too old, that if I had ADHD I would have been diagnosed earlier  Edit : I forgot to mention that I went through my GP because that was the only way insurance would cover it. Thanks for all your responses. I feel so un-alone
