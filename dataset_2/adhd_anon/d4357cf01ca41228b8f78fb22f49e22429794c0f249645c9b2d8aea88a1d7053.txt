d4357cf01ca41228b8f78fb22f49e22429794c0f249645c9b2d8aea88a1d7053;;;anybody else use Trazodone for sleep, or any other sleep medications?;;;I was diagnosed when I was 6, and have been on medication ever since then (21 now).   When I got to college, my doctor just wasn't cutting it anymore when it came to helping me with meds, so I switched to a psychiatrist (which I would HIGHLY recommend over a regular doctor, she seems to care a lot more about how I am personally affected by meds and my doctor never seemed to care). When I first started going to her, she asked me if I was on sleeping meds. At the time I was not so I told her this, and she freaked out. I have always had issues sleeping (still now, but I can clearly remember not being able to sleep as a child as well) and so I was excited somebody actually thought giving me sleeping meds was a good idea.  Basically, ever since being on Trazodone (1.5 years now) I have had much better sleep, and my life has basically done a 180 from what it was before.   My issues is that sometimes I wake up in such a haze, like I cannot even get out of bed or wake up at all, and could end up sleeping all day. It doesn't happen every time I take it, but it's really annoying because I end up missing class/work and not being able to do anything all day.  Does anybody else who uses sleep medications or specifically Trazodone have this issue? Any stories about being on Trazodone and how you liked/disliked it? Or anybody else have any good suggestions for sleeping better?  **tl;dr been on Trazodone for 1.5 years now, sometimes I have issues waking up after taking it, anybody else have this issue or other Trazodone stories?**
