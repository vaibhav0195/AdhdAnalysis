I don't know which part of that is having the most effect here, but last week a friend of mine passed away. I don't know how to be. When it's on my mind I just end up having panic attacks, rest of the time I keep busy enough to not think about it and I don't feel ready for any of it. Lately it feels like one bad thing after another and I feel I'm reaching the breaking point.   Does anyone else have this much difficulty when it comes to grief? if so how do you do it? I feel like I can't and there's no one I can talk to about it.   EDIT: Thank you everyone for replying, I didn't know what to expect when posting this but it has helped a lot and is beyond appreciated.
