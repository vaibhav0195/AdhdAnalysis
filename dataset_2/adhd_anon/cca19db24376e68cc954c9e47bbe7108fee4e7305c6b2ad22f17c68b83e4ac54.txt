cca19db24376e68cc954c9e47bbe7108fee4e7305c6b2ad22f17c68b83e4ac54;;;Advise on Straterra;;;Hi guys,  So my phyciatrist has mentioned putting me on Strattera (unsure on dosage) as my first real medication to help my ADHD (I was just diagnosed a few weeks ago)  What can I expect?   I have read a bit about them, if I am honest I thought the next stage would be more of a stimulant than anything else.  I just don't see how Strattera will help with my procrastination, my get up and go and actually completing tasks? Why to me is my biggest issues?  Will these help me focus and get the task done?  Any advise would be fantastic as I just dont know where im at just now,  Thanks
