The trimester before I started, I got the highest GPA I have had since starting high school, a 3.64.  Accomplishment:  Third tri, about a month and a half before I started taking meds, I was off to a really bad start. When I started taking meds, I was at a 2.5(somewhat due to assignments I missed due to a trip but were entered as zeros before I made them up) and by the last day of school I got it up to a 3.71 which is the highest grade I've gotten in highschool. Two classes that were both F's turned into A's, and I scored two standard deviations higher than the class average on a college class final.   Now in summer I'm off meds and feeling great, but I'm very pleased with my recent academic accomplishments and the hard work that I put in to achieve them.
