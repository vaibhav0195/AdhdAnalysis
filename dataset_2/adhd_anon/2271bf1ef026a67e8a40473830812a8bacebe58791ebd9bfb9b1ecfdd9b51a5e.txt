2271bf1ef026a67e8a40473830812a8bacebe58791ebd9bfb9b1ecfdd9b51a5e;;;An idea for helping improve personal focus with help from others-through minecraft;;;First off I am not sure if this is the proper place to post this. Here I go:   1. like many on here I have trouble focusing-surprising I know right?   2. I love playing games-especially minecraft  3. The interesting part is that I have trouble focusing on a single goal, as there is no "end goal" as well as any idea I have changes over time to the point thag I end up having NO idea what I was originally going for...and I feel kind of depressed/confused  4. I don't have anyone around of which I can ask to help me directly because they either don't have ADHD or they don't have the game  5. I want to make this into a let's play (uploaded to youtube) where our difficulties are present, unedited and instantly relatable...but we help each other and maybe learn something from it.  6. The great part is that we can truly SEE what any progress we make because...our progress is right there in front of us. Even if someone does not play the game they can see what we are going through and see the camaraderie we have in focusing and helping each other.  My question is: is there an interest here for a couple others to join me in a private server and make a lets play?    I do apologize if this is not the place to post this and any questions/suggestions are welcome and appreciated! If for some reason some has something to "rage" about please preface the comment with "rage:" so I can properly prepare myself. All in all I hope you all have a great day and thank you for the community's existence, the moderators effort, the member's involvent and mojang's/notch's fruitation.   Sincerely,  Hohnsenhoff
