I just wanted to share my thoughts and ask for input on hobbies. I've always been envious of people (ADD or non) who are able to hyperfocus on something, whether it's productive or fun or just work. As someone who was undiagnosed until college, I didn't have the motivation or ability to pursue things throughout my adolescence so I've always felt like I've had a lot of catch up to do from people who have been doing things for years. I get super envious of people who do the things I'm interested in, like programming, guitar, music production, sports, etc., but have been doing them since they were younger and are past that "learning" phase.  I think everyone here knows how hard it is to get over the hump of learning something new. We just want to get into that gratifying stage of being good at something, but can never stick with a hobby long enough to get there. Does anyone have tips for toughing out the grace period between starting something new and getting good enough to have fun with it?
