81f7c75171b6360c79edf48c6841c037cedea5e7784b099415163eefdff22f0c;;;I told my doctor Vyvanse is not working for me but he still prescribes me to it;;;Ive been on Vyvanse for close to a year.  Around last May i started to feel like it wasn't working as well as it used to, in August i got changed from 60mg a day to 70mg, and it didn't seem to help much.  The last couple months I've started feeling some anxiety and mood swings. At school I get distracted much more than i normally would, and have frequent day dreams. A couple weeks ago I had a huge anxiety attack. Also i feel a lot more stress than i usually do, and over react about little things.  I've told all of this to my doctor... but he still prescribes me to Vyvanse.  Why does he still prescribe me to Vyvanse? Should i just ask him to change my prescription?  Edit: Thank you all for the responses, i found it very helpful and are much appreciated :)  Edit 2: Just wanted to say i think its amazing that people care enough to give their insight
