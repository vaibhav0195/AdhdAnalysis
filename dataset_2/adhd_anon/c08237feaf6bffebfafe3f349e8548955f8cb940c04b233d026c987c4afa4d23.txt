My main psychiatrist suggested to increase Zoloft by 25mg, and after me suggesting i probably have ADHD, she prescribed 150mg Wellbutrin in addition. Have not started it yet.  After discovering the only person in the region who deals with adult ADHD and visiting him, he prescribed me with 36mg Concerta. I thought i'd be glad to find someone who understands the condition, but he turned out to be inexperienced and frankly suspicious. (He prescribed it very easily, and seems to be running a good deal with the local pharmacy store).  I just don't know what to do, and am just tired of juggling the issues with these conditions as i can never seem to directly point to the main culprit. What do i do, take Wellbutrin as my main psychiatrist suggested or give Concerta a shot?
