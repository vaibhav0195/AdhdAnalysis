Three medications. long post warning.;;;NOTE: don't judge the medication solely on what I say everyone reacts differently this is just my experience. With these medications I try giving two day to dosage level as I adjust up and down to gauge the effectiveness.   Well holy goat soaked shit weasels.      Was that enough of an intro to get you into a what the hell mood? I have been dealing with ADHD for about 33 years now and I have had many trials and tribulation with it and spend most of that time coming up with personal coping mechanisms to adjust to it. I tend to be a rather introspective person and am in a generally consistent state of self analysis. I have also had a lot of personal outside learning classes and such and read like mad, cause I am a bit of a nerd. I also have a lousy keyboard that needs to be replaced soon and so if I misspell a lot or go off on little tangents please bear with me. (yeah like all of us don't do this.) Okay, so my son in now seven and I am seeing him in a light like my own past glaring at me and shaking it's finger and I want to do all I can to make his life better than mine. After years of having given up on doctors and medications to help with what I believe is just how I am wired I decided to do what I can with me before I put my kid through any of that, and I though this might be a worthwhile thing to share if it can help anyone else in a similar situation.(my new medication I also think is helping to compel me as well) In around June I decided after my child had a rather "okay" year at school, that maybe it is time to see what I can do to make life better for him, me, and my wife whom I can now see is in the same fix and is probably the root reason she can keep up with me.        Here we go. I went to my doc and asked point blank about aderall and ADHD.(little more of a back story but in the interest of time bear with it). He had said that the standard operating procedure about that kind of stuff is to talk to a psychologist first, get an assessment and then talk to a psychiatrist and pursue medication and treatment from there. Well all that done I was given aderall to deal with my ADHD (probably C, but high functioning). Here we get into the Goldilocks story. I tried Aderall for a while and I was better able to focus and interact with others and the world, I felt safer in traffic and performed better at work. Then there was the side effects mostly on the come down: Tight jaw a need to constantly clench my teeth and chew on something (gum, wire coating sleeve, zip tie ends) also not so much mood swing as much as flat out grumpy anger, and headaches. I found that the headache was due to a lack of caffine and had to get off that gradually to reduce caffine withdrawls. Aderall I would say is the Drill instructor it will make you perform and do your duty and ride you hard and put you away sore and tired.      So I e-mailed my doc and we decided to try ridalin or the off brand kind anyways. This one I didn't take to well at all. I always felt just wrong. I felt like my head was in a fog and I was slow tired and just bogged down. I was also developing a cold and that didn't help it much either. Still I was not doing well on the medication. Coworkers noticed and my wife even made note that I was just zoned and zonked out on this one.(my wife is helping me gauge the medication from outside perspective). So I stuck with it for only a week and it just seem to make things actively worse, I had lower attention span and keeping things in mind, problem keeping to a schedule and remembering task or even at times what I was doing in  the moment. Ritalin I would call the mugger it shows up cleans you clock and leave you in the gutter.      So I e-mailed my doc and we had a little a little back and for about the medications and whether or not to try a non-stimulant. I am scared of them flat out. I seem to have a higher than normal sensitivity to drugs that interact with the brain in that fashion. I had a back experience with Topemax for cluster headaches out of the blue a few year ago and it left me a blank robotic stuttering and hi-strung mess. I still can remember most of the three month I was on it. (sucks too apparently some cool stuff happened according to my wife and I wish I could remember or at least been "present" at the time) Well for now I am not going to have anything to due with the non-stimulants.      Dexatrine was the next one up to the plate and my current champion. I have not been on it very long so far and I have just moved up to I believe 15mg 3xpills and I am usually taking them at 7-11-4. Well it started off bumpy. I was on 2x pills and had a mild improvement nothing to noticeable but I was putting it through its paces. Doing alright at work, unlike aderall I was speaking a bit better not so fast or stumbling over my words so much. (also still have the cold, ugh). All in all it seem like a soft touch no real harsh come down and no need to chew excessively. But man I could just lock on and go at work, and was better able to handle the constant interruptions and task switching that goes with it. Today I got up late and don't normally dose on the weekends but I had some work to do and wanted to be on task with it. Today I started the 3x dosage and man it is a whole new world. I am up and going and on point, I feel sharp and finely tuned. I wouldn't say I am euphoric but I can definitely saw i am walking in the same neighborhood. I feel more driven and man I am just happy to be me. I took a shower and it felt great, I saw myself in the mirror and yeah I look alight, and when I got dressed it felt nice. I got to start cleaning the house but I wanted to write this stuff down first and holy fuck weasels I got it done, now let see if I can follow through and post it and get to cleaning up the house.        Analyse yourself and talk with your doc, get a medication that make you feel better, you got this for life find out what works best and change it up if it doesn't do you right. Don't settle just to get along it's you life and livelihood and it's your body. Don't let the doc just tell you what to do, work with them because they just have practice and standard procedure, only you have first hand knowledge of you. ADHD is not a cure and isn't really a problem, it only seem like it because of others outside looking in. So don't medicate to feel normal do it to feel functional and be better. I am still ADHD but now I can break off enough attention to deal with "normal" people. The way I see it, lap them and catch up that way, don't just hobble yourself cause they are so far behind. Sorry if I sound like a born again, but let you flag fly.
