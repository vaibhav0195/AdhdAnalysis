I was accepted into a MFA program for design and tech here on the east coast.  Well regarded school, fairly competitive (or so they say!), bit of an out of the ordinary program compared to traditional MFA arts programs.  **Background:**  I'm currently on meds and see a doctor, and have an official diagnosis.  I have a few days until I must put down my deposit confirming my spot for the fall - I'm leaning towards yes, although financially I'm terrified of how much debt I'm going to go into.  The other part that worries me is how well I'll do. My undergrad was good, but not great - 2.9, and to be honest, it was a struggle at times.  I was unmedicated, and no diagnosis of ADHD, and in a slightly different field than what I'm studying in grad school.  I'm hoping I got in because of my portfolio, recommendations, writing statement AND GPA, and that a higher GPA in some certificate courses I took after undergrad related to the grad school program all helped get me in to school.  (Yes, apologies for that sentence).   In my statement of purpose I didn't reveal the ADHD anywhere - just mentioned 'some initial struggles' as an undergrad.    **My questions:**  - **Disability services and speaking to profs:** I'm happy to sign up for disability services - I did as an undergrad for depression, which helped me get some extra funding which I used for tutors).  This is my main question - I'm concerned that revealing that you have ADHD will look to professors and perceptions about my ability, and even when to reveal your diagnosis.  I don't want it to be seen as an excuse, but ADHD has affected my performance in the past although I was unmediated while I was an undergrad.  I guess it's a question of 'do you reveal this before potential problems, or wait until there's a problem and then explain because of the ADHD if that explains it'?   If you went through the 'revealed it to professors', how and when did you do it?  It's a catch 22 - in some ways the ADHD does make life difficult and put me at a disadvantage and explain issues related focus and time management; on the other hand, I obviously want someone to understand that I'm not using it as an excuse, either, and will actively manage my condition.  I also don't know who I would reveal it to other students in my program. The hard part is that sometimes I do well with time management and focus, but when there are multiple stressors (health, job, housing) that's when my brain goes haywire, and I find that the ADHD really becomes noticeable.  - **Accommodations:** What accommodations, if any, did you receive from Disability Services, and how did you use them? I'm guessing it's more geared towards undergrads (note taking, longer test taking times, physical materials in tests etc.) but don't even know what accommodations would be available, and how that affects you and how you're seen.  - **Resources:** Are there any good books about ADHD and grad school, and how to prepare? I figure I can spend the summer mentally preparing me for an academic mindset, and any books or sites or threads I can read will help.  It's been over 15 years since I was in school, so it feels like I need help getting back into school mind compared to 'work world' mind.  I don't know if that's me or the ADHD, but resources would help me.  I also have some social anxiety, but a lot of it may just be the 'unknowns' of being in a classroom, what's expected, standards of performance etc.  - **Tips and advice:** I know it's up to me to be proactive on how I deal with ADHD and school and possible part time work, so any thoughts on tips and best practices would be wonderful - in particular how you get over fears you might have around succeeding  I've struggled in life, but getting into school finally feels like something I can be proud of, and really want to succeed at this next chapter, and know planning and ongoing management is one way to do it.  Any help is appreciated.  Thanks!
