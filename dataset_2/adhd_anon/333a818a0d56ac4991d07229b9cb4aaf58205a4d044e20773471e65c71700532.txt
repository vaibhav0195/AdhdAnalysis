I'm a 19 year old male living in The Netherlands and I have been diagnosed with ADD.   Today I was thinking about my ADD and testosterone suddenly popped up into my head. I started to investigate low testosterone levels and ADD/ADHD. But I don't have enough knowledge on this knowledge.  What I've seen is that low testosterone levels can aggravate ADD/ADHD. Anyone out there with more knowledge on this subject?  PS Sorry for my poor english.
