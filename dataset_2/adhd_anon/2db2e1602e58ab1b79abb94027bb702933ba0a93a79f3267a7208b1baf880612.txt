I've recently realized that I need to get a diagnosis and am waiting until after exams to look into it. When I bring it up that I think that I have ADHD people always correct me and say "ADD" because I'm not "bouncing off the walls."   My understanding is that ADD and ADHD are the same; there are three types of ADHD -Impulsive, hyperactive and combined - and that ADD is just an older name for ADHD. Please correct me. I don't want to sound like an idiot when I talk to people.
