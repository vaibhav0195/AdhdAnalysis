Right as I had the program opened I needed to do work in, I decided to see what the ADHD subreddit was like. After lurking a good 90 minutes on here, here's my first post. I wanna say, this is a great community and the information here is simply wonderful, putting a lot of my anxiety at ease. :) :)  I was diagnosed when I was in elementary school. Typical ADHD story: High IQ, excelled in middle school and highschool (without meds). Got into good engineering school, but without the rigid home structure, I'm struggling, in all of the typical ways.  Currently not taking medication, but I've been talking to a doctor, taken a test to help figure out the medication I need. Hopefully this is soon, but not for at least 4-5 days because he's on vacation. My question for you, rADDit, is I have some work to do in the mean time, and its really hard to stay focused. Any advice on how to stay motivated and focused without medication? Typically I'll medicate with ample amounts of caffeine, looking for alternatives.
