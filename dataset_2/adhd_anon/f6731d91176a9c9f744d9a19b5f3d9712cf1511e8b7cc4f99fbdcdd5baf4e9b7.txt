f6731d91176a9c9f744d9a19b5f3d9712cf1511e8b7cc4f99fbdcdd5baf4e9b7;;;Just started on Concerta (36mg). I feel miserable, pissed off, and anxious.;;;Okay, guys, I'm really struggling here. I was originally on 27mg. But we did some testing and realized some of my inattentive symptoms were not improving. So, we increased my dose. I had about a 2 weeks break between the change.   I started on 36mg 2 days and I feel like I want to go into a rage I can't get shit done because I have this weird wired jittery feeling that's so distracting. I'm also really sad and frustrated. I let my psychiatrist know about this anxiety and he said that it should pass. Is that likely? I don't know how long I can take this for! I should mention that I also suffer from anxiety. So, I administer a 30mg dose of Cymbalta on the side.   Anyone had this experience before?! Help!
