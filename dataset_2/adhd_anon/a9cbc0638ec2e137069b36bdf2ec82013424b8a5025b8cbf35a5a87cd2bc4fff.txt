Sadly I can't access the paper, but the abstract shows the results and findings. Maybe someone with access can find out more.  The conclusion says that childhood maltreatment ("emotional and physical neglect, physical and sexual abuse and witnessing family violence") is significantly associated with ADHD symptoms in adults.   This might be helpful for pre-diagnosing yourself or for any doctors looking to find further indicators.
