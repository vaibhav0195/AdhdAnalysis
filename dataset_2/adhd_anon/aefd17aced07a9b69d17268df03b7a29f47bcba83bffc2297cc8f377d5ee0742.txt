I've been in a serious long distance relationship for about 3.5+ years and the ADHD is becoming a problem. Or it's been one and it just occurred to us that it's to blame.   We lived together 6mo last year and are living together now. We're engaged.  I always assumed my out of sight out of mind way of existing was a personality trait, but apparently it's part of it. It's making him really unhappy as my summer job made me communicate less and it really hurt him that I went. (Long story, TLDR I was selfish and took a job that would make me happy but also depress the crap out of him.) He's starting to hate me.  **How can I work on my ADHD to pay more attention to him? I need suggestions.**  * I clean the house obsessively and yet I can't seem to keep my stuff where it belongs.   * I listen to podcasts and do the dishes and clean the living room while my meds kick in but then it's back to a mess after breakfast. **How can I integrate that cleaning more regularly into my day?**  * I need tv background noise that's familiar at times, and he feels like he can never watch anything he wants. I half watch most things, and he's fully immersing in stuff so it's hard for him to rewatch. * I'm an Etsy seller so my schedule is way more up in the air than his 9-5, and I've been overwhelmed with holiday orders lately and so I haven't had time with him as much and so I keep trying to get stuff done while still being with him and he feels like he can't do anything. * I know what works for me in terms of getting stuff done, and unfortunately it's making him feel like he has to constantly adapt to me.   He's trying to work around my problems, and I love him stupid amounts- he's not in the wrong for being so upset about these things.  But I want to make it less of a struggle.   **TL;DR: How can I work on making my ADHD messiness/inattentiveness less of a problem in the relationship?**
