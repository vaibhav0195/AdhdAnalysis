I feel like I have a lot of interests that I have pursued for a few days or even months but ultimately I can't seem to stick with any one thing.   I realized this when I was trying to list my hobbies. Aside from reading stuff on the Internet I could not list a single thing that I did on a regular basis for enjoyment. (Aside from a anything that I picked up recently).   Anyone else have the same? And anyone else figure out how to handle this issue?
