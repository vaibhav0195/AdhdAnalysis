So I was diagnosed with ADHD-NOS (not otherwise specified, meaning its caused by something else) in this case caused by vision problems. I am working on improving my vision but currently I am not on meds since they claim that I am fine w/o them while I learn to work around  my ADHD (which is impossible to just sit down and "Focus" if I don;t want to do the task). My friends believe I am suffering from depression as well but my family doesn't know and such. Is it possible that my depression is causing my ADHD? For those of you with both, what have you been doing to get help? Also how have you managed to convince your parents you can;t just "sit down and decide to finish something in 30 min and then just do it and be done" how can you convince them you need meds?
