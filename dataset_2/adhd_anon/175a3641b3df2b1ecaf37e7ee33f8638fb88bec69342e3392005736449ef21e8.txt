I experienced some common side effects, but after it wearing off I felt very annoying palpitations and a weird chest feeling. I couldn't sleep, I only fell in a more deep sleep at 6 or 7 am. Today I experienced less pronounced side effects but now that it wore off I have again a uneasy feeling in my chest and I literally feel there's a knot in my throat. It could be anxiety but It doesn't feel like anxiety, I mean, I don't feel particularly anxious, I don't know if I can explain. It's 3 am where I live and I feel I wont be able to sleep again. Why are the side effects so much worse after Ritalin wearing off, is it the crash? But I don't feel any emotional distress, just physical. It was supposed to wear off around 6 pm... Mentally I'm pretty much my usual self, agitated, inattentive, all that "normal" stuff.
