My brother was diagnosed maybe around age 10 with ADHD. He took medication for it up until some point in high school (Adderal, I believe) but it kept him up at night and he stopped taking it. Since graduating high school, his life has been a downward spiral. What few friends he still has left from those days have grown up, and have families of their own, went to college, etc., and my brother has been working pt jobs, playing video games to the point of a full blown obsession, and smoking a lot of pot while living at my parents house. I know the Rules say not to mention drug use, but I've read that substance abuse is fairly common with ADHD, and I think it's important to mention. He also doesn't have the best personal hygiene.  He seems depressed, very introverted, and is very defensive to ANY kind positive suggestions on how to better himself. He's extremely forgetful, lazy, an although he expresses a desire to better himself, it's like he mentally can't figure out how to do it  My question is how can I, or my family help my brother realize that he needs help controlling his ADHD so he can have a better life. It breaks my heart to see him not mentally be able to better himself. At the same time, this is a very fragile subject to him, just trying to bring it up will cause a blow out, as he has a very 'know it all' behavior towards this subject.
