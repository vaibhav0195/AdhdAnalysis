She thinks it could be useful for everything we have going on in our life - I'm in grad school, we are fixing up the house to sell it in 18 months, we have a somewhat complex financial management system ongoing, we both work, we volunteer in a local non profit and our parish.  . . And more.   We have Google calendar and physical planners etc, but she wants to give this sort of thing a try. Basecamp is aimed at (and priced for) businesses and I just don't have a hundred bucks a month to blow on this. However, I've come across several articles on software aimed at personal productivity.   Anyone have any suggestions? I'm not looking for a simple to-do list app, but something more complex that can integrate multiple projects in different domains.
