Help!;;;I haven't been diagnosed with ADHD, but I'm pretty sure (even though everyone thinks they have ADHD nowadays) I have it. I'm going to a mental health clinic soon.   My Mom is depressed over the fact that I'm turning out to be a loser rather than a success/hard worker. I just sit on my computer all day. She used to be sad over the fact that I dropped out of college. Now that I've got a job lined up for 5 months from now, she's sad over the fact that I sit on my computer all day (tv, videogames, google, etc.) , and I don't help around the house. I also don't currently bring in any money. I'm supposed to do the tax return, but I've been taking months to do it. I rarely do chores.   I've been trying to get over whatever this ADHD-like thing is on my own, but I can't. I've been trying for years.   It's hard for me to talk about ADHD with her. I got sort of obsessed with it. She doesn't fully believe in ADHD. If she did, she wouldn't believe that I have it. She think I'm lazy or spoiled. Hell, I'm having trouble believing I might have it. It feels like cheating to give the blame to something other than myself.  Is there any way I can help her before I visit a shrink? Can I convince her to be happy even though I am having trouble? Thanks. :)
