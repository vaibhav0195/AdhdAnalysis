How do I get what I want?  I'm a 40 y/o male.  As I start to write this out, it suddenly seems obvious that the #1 bad sign is that I don't feel I have anyone in real life I can talk to about this.  Rather, I am headed to a message board to do this anonymously.  So I guess I still have some shame issues to work through, and I guess my social network could use some shoring up.  With that...  I always want to quit my jobs sooner or later.  When I was married, this caused me great distress because, even with no kids, my wife could never support the two of us.  I got divorced, got a great job, and my new lifestyle let me spend a ton of time in the sun and fresh air guilt free.  I had a light heart about work, feeling I could leave whenever, which naturally made it easier for me to enjoy.  Fast forward.  Been seeing this girl for about two years, and though we live apart, it's totally clear where she wants it to head (move in together, eventually marriage), and when life is good, I'm fine with the moving in, and convincible about the marriage, someday, with a prenup.  And now, bam!, awesome job suddenly bores me to tears, and new manager/scrutiny is making it feel much more like a job than play.  :-(  My heart is telling me to leave this job, live outside (bike touring or similar), and return to the world of work only when I yearn for it.  (I did this successfully for a month last year.  Life was so simple.  I loved it.)  Fear is telling me that at my age, maybe the next awesome job won't be so easy to find.  And love has me paralyzed, because I really don't look forward to the heartache and hurt on both sides if/when I (a) become a different person [in her eyes], and (b) leave.  Have you been here?  Any guidance?
