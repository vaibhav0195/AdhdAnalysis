As is often the case, the benefits were immediate--I was finally able to reply to emails, do chores, pay bills, and study all in the same day. Needless to say this was just a starting dose, and at my next appointment two weeks later I was bumped up to 20mg XR, then another two weeks later 20mg XR plus 5mg IR later in the day. While the IR bump helped a good part of the time, it sometimes made me a little irritable and extra sensitive to noise, so I tried taking 30mg XR with no bump, and found it gave me the perfect combination of long-lasting and smooth. I'm going to bring this up with my doc at the next appointment on Monday, but it's a bit discouraging that it seems like I'm playing a game of cat and mouse with my tolerance, and I'm wondering how long it takes to find what "works".   tl;dr: Have been on adderall for 2 months, have had to keep upping the dose.
