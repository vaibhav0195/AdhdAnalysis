Bragging encouraged.;;;##### WIN WEDNESDAY!!!  *Just wanted to remind people to **upvote this post**. Recently, our weekly threads get pushed off the page pretty quick. More upvotes = more wins = more people getting inspired (it is a cycle).*  #####Science behind Win Wednesday   * Scientists think our brain has a built in negativity bias by reacting more to a negative stimulus. In effect, our brain is like velcro for negative experiences and teflon for positive ones.   * Painful experiences are usually more memorable than positive ones and lasting, good relationships typically need at least a 5:1 ratio of positive to negative interactions.  * By **tilting toward the good** you are leveling the playing field.    * **Instead of positive experiences washing through you like water through a sieve, they’ll collect in the implicit memory deep down in your brain.**  * **Soak in the positive events in your life**   * By pausing and holding that positive feeling for a BIT longer, you are slowly changing the wiring of your brain.   *I have much more information on the neuroscience of recognizing the good, let me know if you want more info.*  ***  Win Wednesday is a chance to focus on our accomplishments for the week. Doing this enough WILL change your brain for the better!  ###***The Sacred Creed of Win Wednesday:***  * **Each and every one of us have victories every week, be they great or small. But in Win Wednesday, *no* victory is truly a small one.**  * **Whatever "level" you happen to be at, progress is *always* a cause for celebration!**   * **Please don’t discount anything you have done. The whole point is to share how YOU won, and did not let your ADHD win!** Check out the examples to see what we mean!**  *** * The point of Win Wednesday is equally **to share our wins AND celebrate the wins of others!** If you do or don’t have a win, feel free to give positive support and cheer to those posting (not just upvoting)!  * **Each week Win Wednesday gets hundreds of views, but only 5 people replying to the winning comments...let’s change things this week!** Just saying “good job” means a lot to someone who has been struggling!  ***  ##### PHENOMENAL EXAMPLES FROM PAST WEEKS: (updated 5/28) **FRESH**  * I graduated college!  Fuck yeah! * I paid off my credit card. * FINALLY hung my custom mirror that's been gathering dust in the hallway for about a month. * Finished some more group projects ahead of schedule so I'm not the one everyone is waiting on. * Today I realized I was the common denominator in many bad relationships that are most important to me. I told my loved ones this and started a new chapter today. Feels good. * So far, I've managed to make $90 doing different repair work. This is a pretty big deal for me, my ADHD is bad enough that I'm on disability * I had my highest GPA ever.[1]   with my most difficult courses ever * Got my blood work done, got stuff needed for other medical testing, and I set up an appointment with a woman's counselor to add to the therapy I am already doing * I'm late but I finally stopped talking about auditioning for a play at my local theater and did it!  * I got engaged. :) * I think I have finally identified a definable improvement of my meds. * Many many more!  ##### We love you, /r/adhd! BE PROUD and celebrate with each other! -- *your community managers.*  #####

Asking questions and giving answers is the name of the game!;;;#### Another Friday is upon us! Time to ask and answer some questions!  ***   ## The main purpose of this thread:  * Provide a place for people to **ask simple questions** which may not need a dedicated post.   * Give people **new to the  /r/ADHD community (and there are thousands of you)** a chance to say hello and share a bit about their strengths, struggles, and dreams.   * Reduce the amount of threads asking a simple question in /r/ADHD  ***   **This is the place for questions like:**  * How do I force myself to eat despite a depressed appetite?   * What was your experience on [medication]?   * I took Adderall for the first time yesterday, and now I have tentacles growing out of my back!   * Did you tell your friends, coworkers, family about your ADHD?    * Do you feel like your ADHD makes you special?   * How do I talk to [doctor, psych, parents] about getting an ADHD diagnosis?   * What smells like red?    **We will attempt to answer every question in this thread (within a week). Hopefully others will help us out...but we won’t leave you hangin'!**  ***   Another method of communicating is to [](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=/r/ADHD).  ## The idea is to consolidate all of these kinds of questions into a single place that is more easily searched.  As we migrate from my temporary wiki to the new reddit wiki, these threads will be helpful.
