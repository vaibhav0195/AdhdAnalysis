I do not have depression. I bombed my finals, but still got good marks in the classes.   (This is my first post on reddit ever! :P)  I'm in the middle of getting diagnosed for ADHD through my college.  I've already been diagnosed with anxiety and depression, but I "personally" thought that I had ADHD too.   I mentioned that to my therapist. I'm nervous that I don't have ADHD and my therapist keeps kind of hinting that she doesn't think that I have it, which is making me doubt myself.  I'm not 100% sure why I made this post, but I'm feeling down right now. I have two finals tomorrow and have been trying to make myself study, but I can't. I don't know what to do. Normally, my anxiety will kick in and make me study, but lately (since I've started therapy) my anxiety has lessened.  Normally, this is a good thing, but I feel like I NEED my anxiety to function. I start to do stupid things (forget stuff, procrastinate) when I'm not feeling anxious.  I think that my anxiety and depression stem from possible ADHD (inattentive type). If I don't have it, then I'll be confused on what's wrong with me... Anxiety and depression feel like the result of a problem. Not necessarily the root of my problems.  TL;DR: I think that my anxiety and depression stem from ADHD. Worried that if I don't have it, then I won't know wtf is wrong with me. Been having trouble studying lately, since my anxiety has lessened.

I was worried that if I didn't have ADHD that I wouldn't be able to figure out what my problems were stemming from.   Today,  I was informed by my counselor that I did have ADHD-PI. I also have anxiety. It just feels good to know what's going on with my brain! I'm also excited to use some of the resources at my college to help me study better. I thought I'd share this with you all :)  Tomorrow I'll be meeting with my school psychiatrist to talk about medication.   It's funny because my mother has always joked that I had ADHD. She was right. I've also suspected this for a while now.  TL;DR: Got diagnosed with ADHD-PI and anxiety. Feels good to know what's up with my brain!
