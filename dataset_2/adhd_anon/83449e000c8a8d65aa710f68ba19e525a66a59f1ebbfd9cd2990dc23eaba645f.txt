My niece has severe ADHD, she had a teacher who was letting her do her tests orally, but since she's changed teachers her grades have dropped by 30% because her new teacher doesn't. I'm sure this is a documented ADHD issue and can be included in her IEP if we can find some evidence to back it up!

Totally spaced on jury summons, what do?;;;I kept meaning to fill out my exemption form (I have children under twelve for whom I'm the primary caregiver) but instead it just sat in the car until yesterday, when I realized I was supposed to appear on the 14th!!! The paper said I'll face a fine of $100-$1000!!!! We totally can NOT afford this right now,  I'm freaking out. Do I have any leeway on this considering my failure to comply is 100% the fault of my stupid ADHD? Ugh, i feel like punching myself in the face for this!!
