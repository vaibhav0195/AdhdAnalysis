It helps immensely in my ability to focus and deal with anxieties, negative thoughts, etc. Now my question is can you beat adhd by being completely present? I'm very into spirituality and being present in the moment. Understand the feeling of being fully conscious, etc. however despite this I still find it incredibly difficult sans adderall. Its like I know what I'm supposed to do but my brain wont allow it. I dont necessarily fully understand how adhd works in the brain, is it just possible that we are not biologically able to be "present?"
