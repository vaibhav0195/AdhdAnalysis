I was diagnosed with ADHD December 2010 at the age of 17; my doctor couldn't understand why it had taken so long as I was "the most clearcut case" he'd seen in years. I was trialled on Ritalin, Equasym and Concerta but they all gave me extreme side affects including nose bleeds, depression, severe anxiety and migraines. As such, after I completed my A-levels I returned to trying to cope without medication. I now study an incredibly intensive course at university (Law) and I'm struggling with my organisation and anxiety. I cannot cope with social situations very well, and people mistake my abject fear for me actually disliking them. (Also I have twitches, is that a by product of ADHD?).  Basically, i don't understand my ADHD, I'm anxious, hyperactive and confused and would quite like some advice. How do you deal with your ADHD? What does your ADHD prompt in you (twitches, hyperactivity, disorganisation)? Would you recommend that I return to being medicated for the sake of my degree and possible social interactions?  **tl;dr I'm a bit of a confused mess right now, advice would be very much appreciated**
