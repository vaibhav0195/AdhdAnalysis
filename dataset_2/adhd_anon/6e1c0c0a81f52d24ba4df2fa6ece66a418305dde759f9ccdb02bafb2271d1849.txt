6e1c0c0a81f52d24ba4df2fa6ece66a418305dde759f9ccdb02bafb2271d1849;;;My first day on Adderall (legal);;;It reminded me of a story my dad once told me.  "When I was young I always crashed into things and got hurt- eventually the doctors realized very soon that I had horrendous eyesight. When I was 6-8 years old I got my very first pair of glasses that were custom for me.  He hadn't even know that leaves were not just a bushily single entity, this was the first time he had noticed the edges and distinctions.  Today was one of the best days of my life. I was able to get to class, actually pay attention, socialize with neighbors much more, I did all my household chores, basically everything but actual schoolwork.  This was one of the first days in my life where I was able to just be me. Words do not do justice to a veil that has been over your eyes your entire life being lifted up. Kind of an Allegory of the Cave metaphor.   I just got prescribed 10mg xr, it didn't' do much and SWIM has done way to much of this drug before but for recreational purposes. I took 2 10mg xr and voyaged out into the world. The 10s do nothing for me from experience, so we will see what happens next.   It helps as well that I have klonopin to keep the anxiety down and ambient to help me sleep at night. My psychiatrist is an amazing woman and has been helping me for 3 years.
