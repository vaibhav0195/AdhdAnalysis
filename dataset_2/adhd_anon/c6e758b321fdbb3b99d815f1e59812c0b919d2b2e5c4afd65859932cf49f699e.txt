c6e758b321fdbb3b99d815f1e59812c0b919d2b2e5c4afd65859932cf49f699e;;;I googled "average intelligence and still be smart" and ADHD articles popped on the first page. Can you have a low or average IQ and still be smart?;;;I got around to reading my diagnosis paperwork after a year of getting it, and found I fall 92 IQ, which is barely at average intelligence.   My parents and teachers and other people called me smart, intelligent and bright all the time. I begin to wonder how I am smart with a 92 IQ? With this score I'm not much better than anyone else. If I was actually smart, wouldn't I fall under the 115+ range?  Is IQ even a good measurement of intelligence? If not, what can?  Can you have an average iq and still be smart?
