Also, with drugs like strattera, progress takes place over such a long period of time that it's hard to notice that things are getting better.  I had a "lightbulb" moment in the car this morning about just how much progress I have made. Let me tell you what my morning was like.  ~8:00 woke up (I usually wake up at like 6:30am for work, so this is a good amount of sleeping in for me) made some toast, took meds, got back in bed and surf the internet.  ~9:00 parents wake up. I let them take over in the bathroom because they have somewhere to go. Spend some quality bonding time with my cat. start thinking about what I need to do today.  ~10:00 get up. shower, dress. Separate laundry.  ~11:00 Put a load of laundry in, leave for Costco. I have a written list of things I need to get, but I am also able to keep a mental list. my brain used to be like a sieve when it came to remembering shopping/to do lists. I get to costco and didnt forget anything at home (like my card, wallet, or house keys.)  ~12:30 Go Home. On the way, start thinking about what I want for lunch at work next week, and what ingredients I need to buy at the grocery store tomorrow and what I already have in the house.  Put cold food away. switch laundry. Now i'm sitting here writing this.  Before it would have taken me until 4pm to actually leave the house.  Idk. this is just a small snapshot of my life, but i never thought life could be this easy
