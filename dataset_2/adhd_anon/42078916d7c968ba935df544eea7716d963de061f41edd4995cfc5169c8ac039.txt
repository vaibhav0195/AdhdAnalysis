42078916d7c968ba935df544eea7716d963de061f41edd4995cfc5169c8ac039;;;Opinion on stimulants for treating ADHD;;;I recently got diagnosed with ADHD and was prescribed 30mg Vyvanse to be taken daily, Been taking it for about 2 - 3 weeks and for the first few days I felt energetic, Focused and my concentration got better, But after those few days it stopped working and i was getting nothing but side effects and a speedy feeling, Couldn't eat, Couldn't sleep and my social anxiety got 10x worse. The reason I'm posting this is because I want to know if anyone has gotten this before and what they have done and also what you think of stimulants for treating ADHD, I think they hand out prescriptions to easy and that stimulants are a bad road to head down  Edit 16/12/2016: I talked to my psychiatrist yesterday and he increased the dose to 50mg which I took this morning and it seems to be working again!
