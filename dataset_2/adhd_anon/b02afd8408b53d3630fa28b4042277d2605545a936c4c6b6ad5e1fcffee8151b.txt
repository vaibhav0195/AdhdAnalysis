b02afd8408b53d3630fa28b4042277d2605545a936c4c6b6ad5e1fcffee8151b;;;Just got diagnosed. It all makes sense now!!!;;;I just always thought everyone was like this. That everyone has their thoughts going a million miles and hour hopping from one thing to another not paying attention to conversations, lectures, important events.  It did feel frustrating for the longest time. Because I would zone out and my family often got frustrated at me. I'd get yelled at and feel incompetent. My family was loving nonetheless. They tried to encourage me with meditation but it never worked quite that well. This zoning out caused me to be anxious to ask questions incase people have already said whatever I'd go to ask about.  The constant yelling, mediocre grades, people making fun of me because I would stutter when I talked and talk about random things that "in no way connected to the conversation ( clearly it does they're just a little slow)"  Today I was diagnosed with ADD-PI. I'm so glad I finally have an answer.
