f195700759d83210835f392e8ec5acb71c7dc0d4ac00a3ae90a27126861d5ecd;;;I've always wondered how much I could have accomplished;;;It's hard not to dwell on this. I was diagnosed as an adult, and I often wonder what it's like to be organized, to have the attention span to learn more, to feel as smart as those who can focus longer and learn more. This can be a very disheartening condition. At the same time, I'm 42 and had the best physical of my life a few months ago.
