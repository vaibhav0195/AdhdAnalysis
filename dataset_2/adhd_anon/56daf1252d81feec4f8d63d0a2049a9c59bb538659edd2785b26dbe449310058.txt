I'm on a dose that works and things are great, except I've had some serious dry mouth issues. Far worse than normal side effects, from what I've seen.       Basically I've either got to find something that works, change medications, or quit all together.       The major things the meds help with are being present and engaged when I need to be and being able to pay attention. Not to mention my fidgeting is gone.       Are there any medications (probably non-stimulants) that would work well with these issues, rather than just hyperactive symptoms?      Or solutions for dry mouth? The biggest issue I've got is my tongue gets rough and dry, and burns a little. I've tried biotene, gum, drinking massive amounts of water, etc, and nothing seems to do the trick.
