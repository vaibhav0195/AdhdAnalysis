I really don't know how to explain better in a simple sentence. What I mean is: do you guys feel like you have symptoms of other similar disorders?  I have taken tests and I come up as borderline autistic, OCD, depressed, mild mood disorder and anxious (GAD). Of course I don't think I am actually depressed and etc, just that ADHD is a bit like all of these put together. So to me it feels like ADHD is the starting point, and then there's a point when you have to draw a line and say that these oppressive thoughts are no longer normal for ADHD and now we have to consider OCD. Or maybe your mood swings are too drastic and we have to consider bipolar disorder.  Do you guys feel similar?
