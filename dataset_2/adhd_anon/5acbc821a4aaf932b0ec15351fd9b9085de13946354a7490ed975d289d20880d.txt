They have asked us to put him on a Sugar Free/Gluten Free diet to see if he calms down ( seems to slow him down a bit).  for any experts out there The Symptoms are: 1.In ability to question things. He does not ask questions. 2. wants to be physically active ( climb/jump/run) etc.  My question(s): When we were in the US ( we are in India for a vacation), I thought that his speech / interaction was slow because he is confused with English and our mother tongue.   Back in india , he seems genuinely happy with his grand parents and cousins.   We are beginning to wonder if being in a larger community helps him to build his speech etc.  Does any one have thoughts?
