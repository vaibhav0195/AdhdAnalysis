I am simply seeing many, many things that point to ADHD (the professionals agree with me) and want to make sure that her habits, such as fidgeting and daydreaming are seen and appropriately handled, both by me and by her school.   At this point, I don't care about a firm diagnosis. However, I'm wondering if I should make sure I get one soon or if it will matter. The professionals have repeatedly said "It's not too early to diagnose her."   We are currently out of the states. Once we get back in about a year, it will be registering her for school, finding docs, etc, etc.   Would it be beneficial or harmful in either way? Thoughts?
