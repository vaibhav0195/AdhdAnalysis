1f8cc92dfcc0d6ded0db0f46d8ee1b7fa1d5a7cba76192836905e3ae322e40e5;;;Guys i'm in some deep shit, adhd seems to be getting worse and my treatment options are running thin. Also severe dependence.;;;Pre diagnosis i always thought i was dumb, i had a 1.8 GPA pre diagnosis that gradually rose to a 4.3 after being put on medication(concerta--&gt;adderall).   Then senior year they stopped working like they used to, gave me bad anxiety and my studies were tanking. I'd pull all nighters at least once a week because i'd procrastinate on every single test.   Got put on vyvanse and that smoothed things out a *little* then it became intolerable so i had Intuniv added to the stimulants.   Blah blah blah fast forward to today, i'm a sophomore in college and next semester i could get kicked out if my grades keep dropping. i'm on about my 5th or 6th iteration of stimulants as well as entirely different trials of anti anxiety medication to smooth them out.   So you might be thinking "just try the nonstimulants, clearly these aren't working" and you may be right. Problem is is that i've been on stimulants(mainly amphetamine derivatives) for so long that when i stop my grades begin to plummet, like straight down.  Besides it's going to be a while until i'm not required to take these meds.   And well to make a long story short: I'm completely dependent on a medication i hate taking. Short of desoxyn and strattera i've tried nearly all adhd medication.  It's like my life has been built on one giant mountain of adderall, and i'm scared shitless of losing all this progress.   Anyone else in a similar situation?
