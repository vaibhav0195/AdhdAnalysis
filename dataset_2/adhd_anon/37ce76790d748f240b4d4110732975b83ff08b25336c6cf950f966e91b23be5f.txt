HOWEVER, I just recently completed my BS in Computer Information System at National University (nu.edu). You take only one class at a time and it is only four weeks long. The pace is very fast and there is a ton of work to do, and I found that in most classes I didn't have time to get bored and frustrated because it was over with before I got to the point of wanting to lobotomize myself.  What was double good was the fact that I did the whole thing online, so I could do the work at 3 AM and intensely focus, or, I could read for an hour, go do something else, and then come back to reading or whatever.  Anyway, I'm sorry this is a repeat post, but if it can help someone finish their education while they're young, then, to me, it's worth it! I'm in my mid-40s and wish this college class format style was available to me earlier.
