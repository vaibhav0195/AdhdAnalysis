It's only been a few weeks for me... I got diagnosed and I'm so happy about that, because I have this dream where maybe I have an attention span and am a functional human.   Welbutrin 300mg: I started on this for depression. It changed my life... for a week. I could concentrate, I could think straight, my head was quiet, life was amazing. And then it stopped working. So I started adding coffee... that worked for another week but stopped working, too. So I went in to get properly diagnosed.   Ritalin 20mg XR: Kind of worked once. Did nothing after. Was still taking the welbutrin too and cipralex 20mg, which I've been on for years. That might affect the dosage needed. So I went back in.   Adderall 5mg XR: Guys, I just fell asleep at work. In a meeting. My dumb fault for trying it out on a workday, but I'm starting school tonight and I was impatient. Hoping that maybe that's a short term thing? Like if I take it for a few days maybe I'll be an active person instead of a napper? I also cut down to 150mg Welbutrin because I'm starting to go off it so I can just be using one stimulant. Apparently welbutrin doesn't mix well.    I know the search for the right med can take a while. I've been through it before for other issues. But geez... it's a pain in the ass. I feel like I just paid $100 for sleeping pills that can also give me seizures and now I'm starting a new semester in the same barely -competent situation I was in before.    tl;dr: whiny person hates trying new drugs
