If not, I feel your pain, there is a tl;dr :)**  Some weeks ago, I finally steped on my reluctance at every psycho-something doctors and decided to start a process to finally get diagnosed (or not!) with ADHD. I had a first meeting with a mental health nurse that was really perfect. He asked questions about me, my life, specificity on ADHD and me that could be and many other things. In short: I felt like I was finally taking a really good step in the right direction and that I was in good hands. Next step was to wait until I got to see a real therapist. (There is a waiting list, I'm in Canada and I can't aford private sector.)  And so today was that day. Conclusion : the psychotherapist doesn't see the need to put me on medication. And so I left saying "thanks for your time doc". But in the bus ride home, I started to feel... Weird. Something was not right. And I'm not really sure why I didn't figured that up when I was with the therapist, probably because I trusted her and her expertise but... I'm so angry at me not to have had that reflection while it was time !  I started to think about what we talked about. And I realized that for the hour we've been together, she's the one who made all the talking. It was like I was listening to a documentary on some sort of european women's vision of society... She went on and on, on the positivity of me going back to school. More then 20 minutes of this and her vision of society on the fact that people doesn't help people who want to study subject that are not seen as "useful to society" in general. Then I spoke a minute about the fact that when I dropped out of school before, it was because I felt I had no more of the extra energy to give to do task people do normally. She said "ok", and started to talk about money. An another 20 minutes or so.  An another 10 minutes of her explaining that my high blood pressure should be looked at more closely in a nephorlogist study (!!). And then saying theses dreadful words: « stimulants often don't give the expected results on adults. And I don't see the point on putting you on some. I recommend psychotherapy to start and reevaluate your relationship with money, and I'm writing a note in your file so your familly physicist take you to a nephrologist. » Then, like I said before, I just went away thinking that she know what she was doing...  I don't want to judge her or anything. She's the doctor. But, I feel like she just spoke and spoke, and didn't even tried to evaluate something that seems closely related to ADHD, to just to let me go. I'm just so confused. I was ready to accept that a doctor would say that he/she thinks I should't be said ADHD and/or not put on medication. But I didn't plan on having the feeling that she haven't even tried to navigate on the precise matter I was there to check.  I just... Don't know what to think right now ?  **tl;dr** I had my appointement with a therapist. She won't put me on meds, and I feel that she tried to diagnose anything but ADHD. Now I'm just totally angry at myself not to have had that reflexion in her office and trying to vent not to become lost in frustration.  **EDIT** Thanks to all who are replying. Your inputs are very appreciated.
