The Vyvanse is for BED and ADHD-PI. The Bupropion and Naltrexone is for obesity treatment. I'm 25 years old and this is my first time ever getting an ADHD diagnosis.   I understand that it takes a month or so for the Bupropion to build up in your body. If someone has a low enough seizure threshold, do they experience the seizure in the beginning of their bupropion treatment? Or do the seizures normally begin once the medication has built up in your system?   I'm asking because I have to go to a party this weekend and I don't want to come off as a Sober Sally (peer pressure is awesome) but I'm a little concerned about risking a seizure. I also have my cousin's wedding in mid-June which will probably involve some moderate to heavy drinking. For the record, I'm not an alcoholic but I like to have a little fun every now and then.   Not sure if relevant but all the common side effects of the vyvanse wore off after the first day of taking it (dry mouth, fast heart rate, etc.). I began taking the Bupropion/Naltrexone 4 days after starting vyvanse and those side effects also went away after the first day (Irritability, tiredness, depression, GI issues, etc.).   Appreciate the help.
