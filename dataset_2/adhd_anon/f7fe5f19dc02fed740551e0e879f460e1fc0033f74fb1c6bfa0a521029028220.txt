Instead of the usual anectodes akin to "Whoah man Vitamin C cured my ADHD", I'm more interested in supplements that flat out did nothing for ADHD, had intolerable side effects, or even aggravated symptoms.  I believe these kind of personal experiences would be useful to combat the huge amount of misinformation and anecdotes flying around the nets that only complicates things for us.
