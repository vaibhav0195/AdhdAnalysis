Since reading up on ADHD, I've found a lot of the things I read here comforting, knowing that people have actually gone through the exact same stuff that I have.  I'm undiagnosed (so far), but I had an appointment with my GP today and she had me fill out a quick screening (which was very long and boring and confusing, I kept skipping questions out of habit but I got through them!). The preliminary diagnosis is moderate-severe ADHD but she's referred me to get a formal evaluation done. My question, friends, is what should I expect from this?  I'm going to a psychologist in a few weeks* to get it done, and then I'll have to wait a few days to see if the report comes back positive or negative for ADD/ADHD, but I'm nervous about it all. Thankfully you all have been so kind and helpful, so I really appreciate it.
