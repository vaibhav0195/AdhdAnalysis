Need help from current or former bipolars;;;I have diagnosed Bipolar 4 years ago and am on Lithium and Lamictal. I have had supportive housing, but still haven't been able to keep work. Got into some risky behavior. Before then, had history of bad grades, gambling, crime, homelessness, have had about 120 jobs, none for more than 3 months. Started few businesses, lost or ended them within 12 months. Have had over 500 sexual partners ( at least) and travelled about 900 airline flights. Life has been a mess, failed marriage, everything is a mess. Now I am homeless again and lost my busy lawn care business. I just got stressed out and sold everything and spent the money. I am a horrible manager. I have been taking my meds, and I have not committed crime in 5 years, but still have a lot of the same problems, except no suicide attempts, but getting really down because I can't make it. My 11 year old is diagnosed with adhd or something, is it possible I am misdiagnosted?
