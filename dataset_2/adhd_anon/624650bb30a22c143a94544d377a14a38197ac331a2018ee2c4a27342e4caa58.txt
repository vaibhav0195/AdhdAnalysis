I find it *incredibly* rude, irresponsible and dismissive of our condition, as if we have any to spare. Basically, it's infuriating - even if the person asking is someone you care about who thinks they may have ADHD.   I know some people don't like taking meds everyday - I try to take weekends off if I'm not working, too - but our condition is not, "Oh man, I have a lot of work to do this week, time to get some meds!" It is "My life is going to crumble around me if I don't take these meds every day."   To be fair, I have offered some to my sister before - I'm still pinpointing which meds work best for me, so I had a ton of extra meds before. She said it worked great, so my response was "Great! Go to the doctor for meds/diagnosis." She never did, and asked me again, which made my blood boil.  Am I overreacting? What do you think?    **TL;DR: I think it is SO rude when people ask to borrow meds. Don't know how to describe why.**
