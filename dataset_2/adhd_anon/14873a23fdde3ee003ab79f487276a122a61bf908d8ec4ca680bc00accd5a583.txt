I was diagnosed with ADHD last Fall,  but I currently don't take any medication.  I've always struggled with math. When I sit down to work on it,  I become confused very quickly and I give up on working on it. I was wondering if any of you guys have tips for working on math with ADHD. I know math takes practice and work, two things I struggle with due to procrastination issues, and I'd like to mend this.  TL; DR I struggle with math, any tips for improving my math skills?
