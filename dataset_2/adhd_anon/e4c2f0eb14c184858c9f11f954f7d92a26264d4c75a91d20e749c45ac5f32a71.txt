Fast forward a few weeks and I get my test results back. I am perfectly normal, and have ADHD-PI (which I had another doctor prescribe me with). Whenever I tell my friend I have this he blows me off and tells me that I don't have it, and that I am lying to the doctors so I can get meds. Honestly I don't like any form of illegal substances, and think i really have ADHD-PI. Any help you guys can give me? By the way, he has add as well.
