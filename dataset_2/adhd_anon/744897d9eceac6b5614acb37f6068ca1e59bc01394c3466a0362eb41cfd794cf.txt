744897d9eceac6b5614acb37f6068ca1e59bc01394c3466a0362eb41cfd794cf;;;Today, i got my E-Cig in the mail, and want to cut down on my smoking (due to adderall). Any one have experience with E-Cigs and adderall/any medication?;;;I started smoking regularly (2-5 a day) when a friend told me how amazing smoking was while on medication. I have been on and off medication since i was 5 years old (i am now 20). I'm a junior in college now, and have to consistently take my adderall to study and get work done- i usually take 20 mg adderall XR and another 10 mg reg adderall when doing work.  i smoke about 2-3 cigs/day without adderall, and about 3-6/day with.  anyone have experience or advice about e-cigs and adderall?
