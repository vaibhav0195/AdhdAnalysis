If I remember right I was given instant release ritalin, probably 10mgs or so. When I was maybe 16 I stopped taking my meds, and started again in college when I was 18. That time I was given extended release 18mg ritalin. Now I'll admit I may have abused them a bit in college, possibly more than I remember since I am more educated on the matter now. I remember a terrible bout of depression and anger and suicidal thoughts a few months after stopping again. However now that I am 21, I have come to realize that I am clinically depressed and have some mild anger issues. I used to be the most fun loving, outgoing-est kid that ever lived. Ever since ritalin, life has seemed dull, sort of grey. I often find myself abusing drugs and partying to seek real pleasure, when simply going fishing would make me happy as a clam. Not that any of this is necessarily cause by ritalin directly, but I wonder if my brain never really "reset". If going back to my doctor and getting ritalin again would make me feel normal, then this is not a problem. I guess I am just curious if anyone else has had similar concerns. Thank you all who read this! TL:DR Used to take ritalin, now my brain is fucked :(
