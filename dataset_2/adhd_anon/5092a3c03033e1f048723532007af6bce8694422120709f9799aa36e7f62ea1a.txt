5092a3c03033e1f048723532007af6bce8694422120709f9799aa36e7f62ea1a;;;Thinking about starting an ADHD study group at my school!;;;Just wanted write a lil post here. I posted not too long ago about feeling incompetent in general in terms of college and such. I find myself buried in work and too embarrassed to tell my friends how behind I am, so I don't even have them to lean on for support.   I figured out that's what I really need, support! My school has three therapy groups with our health service center, specific to loss, anxiety, and DBT. I think that I'm going to talk to the director of our accessability resources office and ask about creating a study/support group for students with ADD/ADHD! I know it would be really helpful for me personally, as I do work much more easily when in the presence of others who are expecting me to work (for example, I was studying with some friends until around midnight when they decided to go to sleep... ever since I left their room I've been fucking around on Reddit...). It would also be really useful to connect with other people on campus with the same struggles and fears that I have!  I also just wanted to rant a bit about my personal struggle, since I don't have too many people/places to vent to. It has been a hellish week. I almost stooped to a scary low point today, but luckily a friend knocked on my door and we watched some silly YouTube videos and an episode of "Whose Line Is It Anyway," which always cheers me up.  Sometimes my inability to cope with the stress that my "incompetence" brings me is scary. I have extreme ups and extreme downs, but the ups are so beautiful and I just need to figure out how to prolong them! :)
