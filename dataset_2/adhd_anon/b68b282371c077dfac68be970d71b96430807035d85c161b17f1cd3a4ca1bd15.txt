For me, it's like driving an electric car that can only hold a charge long enough for a 10 mile drive without a gas hybrid engine for backup and no GPS navigation system.  I just have some vague directions with things like *at the 3rd lamp post turn left, then look for the tree that seems to be dying and drive about 50 car normal lengths past that onto the 3rd or 4th unpaved road on the right, I forgot which one it was, but a few weeks ago it had road kill right at side of the road, not sure if its still there.*     If I don't remember I have to charge my car before 10 miles are up, my car stops and I can't go anywhere.     Having a low battery light is helpful, like tasks lists are.  But if the light isn't bright enough or there are too many other indicators on my dash lighting up, I might not notice it in time.  It makes me anxious that I am always worried about the battery being charged (forgetting the things I need to do) while trying to look out for the landmarks to get where I need to go.    Eating right, adequate sleep, and exercising feels like it gives me additional batteries to hold a longer charge, but other cars are all gasoline with the ability to fill up anywhere where as i need to plan my route so i can charge when i need it.    Taking meds is like having a GPS system in the car, adding a hybrid engine for greater fuel efficiency and gasoline backup, and a turbocharger.  Normal people don't need to worry about filling up gas every few miles, they just fill up once a week or so and never think about it.   TL;DR it's like I drive a car that can only go 10 miles at a time.
