I went to my family doctor, explaining that I had always had some issues with inattention and focusing. I could not for the life of me sit down and focus on any assignment I've ever done,every paper I wrote was extremely sloppy and it took me forever to start projects. I found this interfering with work and life.    The only thing I found was that I could actually go to class, sit in class for the full time, and generally pay attention throughout without much issue. This was the main reason why I did not seek treatment earlier    I did an assessment with him, and he suggested that there is a possibility that I did have ADHD.    He prescribed me 30mg, a lower dosage of Vyvanse for 2 weeks, to see if this would help me out. My question was, was the trial and error approach the best way to get a definite diagnosis?
