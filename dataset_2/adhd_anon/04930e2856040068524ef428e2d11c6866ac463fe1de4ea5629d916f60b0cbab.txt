04930e2856040068524ef428e2d11c6866ac463fe1de4ea5629d916f60b0cbab;;;Adult ADD no Insurance;;;Diagnosed as a child and was medicated until 15. I stopped taking meds and found ways to cope. I am 30 now and the brain is not under my control any more. Have alot of lost moments and time stuck on the dumb.  I am a contractor and have no insurance. I cant afford a psych dr and meds but need to do something. I have read Zinc, Fish oil and morning primrose oil can do wonders as a natural alternative to various medications. Does anyone have experience with these things. Also my son (not genetic) is diagnosed bi-polar and I have come to learn alot about it over the last 10 years. I have a real short fuse and can go from 0-totally pissed with heart rate up in seconds then calm back down in minutes. Don't know if I could also be bi-polar or if this is happening because my brain isn't functioning correctly. I know I could find a Dr. and probably be put on disability to get free medical care and pills but frankly I can't live on disability it doesnt pay enough so I have to work.
