77c225d491fe4c2965f510e85f89dc8533c7d510ce5f9f1c81f71add3d98aa5b;;;I'm stuck in a cycle fighting with myself about getting back on medication. Can anyone provide a thought I may not have?;;;I feel like taking medicine is just looking for the easy way out of being a lazy, unmotivated bum. I know that's a common occurrence for people with ADHD, but I can't shake it. I constantly play devil's advocate on everything I hear or do, to the point where my friends and family just think I'm disagreeing with them, so nobody will give me any feedback. I'm hoping you guys can help me break the cycle one way or another. Basically, my thought process is as such:   * 1) I have all of the routines and symptoms. * 2) I've been diagnosed twice and the medication does help. * 3) But what if the doctor was wrong? ADHD is misdiagnosed all the time. * 4) Plus, I do pretty okay without medicine. * 5) But life is simpler and easy when I do have it. * 6) Life isn't supposed to be simple nor easy, quit being lazy. * 7) Repeat. * I hate everything. TURN MY BRAIN OFF
