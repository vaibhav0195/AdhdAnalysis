So since I was diagnosed and started getting a prescription for Vyvanse, my mom has been subtly suggesting that she wants to try one to see what it feels like and to better understand how I feel through out the day. I totally understand this and think it's a reasonable thing to do as a mother. I do however feel that there's another reason she wants to try it: weight loss. She's been trying to lose 10-15 pounds for years and hasn't been able to. She knows the Vyvanse reduces my hunger and I think she wants to try it to see if she can lose a few pounds.   Some background on my mom. In terms of personality she is type A. Very responsible and in control of whatever situation she's in. Always planning ahead months in advance and in charge of the finances (she has to do everything around the house because my dad has undiagnosed ADHD). As far as addiction potential for her I think it's very VERY low. She rarely drinks and has barely experimented with weed when she was younger. Her and my dad used to go out a lot when they were younger in the 70s when hard drug use (cocaine, heroine) was wide spread and she was never drawn to any of it. She 100% prefers to be  completely sober and doesn't even like to drink much.    I'm not too worried but for some reason I still feel weird/slightly nervous about her trying one. They're 20mgs. She's 5'1", 120lbs.  **TLDR: My non-ADHD mom wants to try one of my Vyvanse to understand how I feel during the day. I think she has low addiction potential but I'm still worried. What should I do?**
