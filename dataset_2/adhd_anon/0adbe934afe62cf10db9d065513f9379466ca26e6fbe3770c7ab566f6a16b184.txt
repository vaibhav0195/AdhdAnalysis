A couple of months ago I was going to a psychologist for anxiety issues and was told that their office couldn't test for ADHD because the doctor that did the testing wasn't under my plan (however my psychologist was).   I stopped going because I didn't feels as if we were getting anywhere. Since then I signed up with a new insurance plan (PPO so I don't have to go through a primary doctor).  I'm thinking I should call my old psychologist's office to see if I can get tested now. Or should I just go ahead and find a psychiatrist to test me?  This probably isn't the right subreddit for this, but Aspergers. My younger cousins are possibly on the Autistic spectrum. I began talking to my mom about the way I acted as I kid and made a list and took that to my psychologist. He said that it is possible that I might have Aspergers, but that I would need further testing (which goes back to my insurance didn't cover it at the time).   When I look for autistic doctors they are all listed as child doctors. So who tests for adult autism?
