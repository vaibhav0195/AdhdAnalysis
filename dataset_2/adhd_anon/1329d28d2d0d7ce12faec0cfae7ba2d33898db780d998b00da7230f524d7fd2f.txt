Having a really hard day at work and it's hard enough as it is trying to get over a break-up, but now one thing after another thing at work is going wrong. I feel like it's all my fault too because I keep making stupid little mistakes here and there that affect my work load more than I can handle right now.  I just ran into another obstacle and I feel the monster inside of me is trying to get out and I don't know how to effectively keep it inside long enough for me to finish this day... It's like a knot in my throat and my whole body is tense and shaking. What can I do right now to calm down?
