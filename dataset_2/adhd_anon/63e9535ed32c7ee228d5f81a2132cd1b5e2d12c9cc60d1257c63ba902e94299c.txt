The short version of it is: I moved out to a different country 4 years ago and lost touch with all my friends. I was completely overwhelmed by all the new responsibilities and obligations (switching from parents saying "just study, don't do any chores" to "study for Masters degree, learn new language, household chores, make money, pay bills, live with new boyfriend, etc.)  One friend is in the same different country as me, and 4 years ago wanted to meet up, but I kept postponing due to poor management on my part. I didn't even realise how much I was doing that. Eventually he stopped asking, and I was too ashamed and afraid to talk to him.  Fast forward to now: I have recently been diagnosed with ADHD and social anxiety. I am managing it a bit better, and I am lonely as hell. I want to apologise to my friend, and maybe keep in touch better (meet up, etc.). I consider ADHD to be an explanation, not an excuse, and I really want to do better.  So I want to send a message and invite him over for dinner.  How would you guys go about this? Our country of origin doesn't know much about mental health issues, so I am afraid to mention it because it will likely scare him off, or at least make him uncomfortable. What should I say? How do I apologise? Should I wait until my life is even more stable due to meds and new coping mechanisms?
