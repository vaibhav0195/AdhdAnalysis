What should I do?;;;I am majoring in computer science and mathematics, which require fairly demanding curricula. I'm supposed to graduate in Spring 2017.  My dream employer emailed me a few months ago and asked for my résumé and academic transcript presumably for consideration for an internship. But I never bothered responding because I wasn't comfortable sharing my transcript. My transcript is now *slightly* better than it was then but it's still atrocious, mostly because I wasn't even diagnosed until a year and a half ago.  A lot has happened to me within the past few months and I want to move away and start a new life. Late Friday afternoon, they called me, emailed me (again), and sent me a message on LinkedIn. They seem almost as interested in me as I am in them. To work for them would be the perfect reason to move away. So I figure that I might as well furnish my transcript. My expectations are low but my hopes are high.  My question is how I should submit the transcript. Should I explain what I've explained in this post and hope that they're understanding? Should I simply stress that my résumé is more indicative of my capabilities (which it definitely is)? Or should I not saying anything at all (unless asked)?  **TL;DR**: My dream employer wants to see my battle-scarred academic transcript but I'm not sure whether or not I should send an explanation with it.
