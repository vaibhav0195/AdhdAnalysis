It's been over two months and I'm up to 450mg which apparently is the highest dose I can get.       I can definitively say that it did help with my depression as I don't get down days as much anymore but I still feel very unfocused and distracted. It feels like it did nothing to help with my ADHD.   Does Wellbutrin take a long time to kick in or should I ask my doc about stopping Wellbutrin and explore other options?      tl;dr: Was prescribed Wellbutrin to help with both my ADHD and depression. Don't feel like it helps with my ADHD.
