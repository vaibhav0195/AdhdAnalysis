As long as i've taken concerta, I've always noticed that it has reduced my apetite, overall making me not eat as much as i would when off the medicine.  My issue used to be that it would be hard for me to feel the need to eat. As I've grown older, i slowly made my way to eating regular sized meals while I'm medicated, which brings me to my current problem.  Whenever I either don't take my medicine or It's effects wear off, I have an unending feeling of hunger.  Eating a regular sized meal won't satisfy my stomach.  In addition to this, even when I feel the pressure on my abdomen caused by the ridiculous amount I've eaten, i still feel the need to eat more. Just curious if anyone else has gone through what I have
