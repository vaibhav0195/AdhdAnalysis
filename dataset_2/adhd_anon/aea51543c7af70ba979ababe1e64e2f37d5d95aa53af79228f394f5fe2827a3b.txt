No help from my oncologist, and he is poisoning my ability to get help!;;;I have always had problems with ADHD, but because of the attitude of my family toward the idea of it (they just thought I was lazy and unmotivated, and simply punished me - it was the 70's, and that was the common view then) was never diagnosed or treated.   After graduating college in 91 (barely), I was able to muddle through and fake my way through interviews (I interview very well, and landed some great jobs) but invariably lost them because of my inability to multitask, get tasks completed in a timely manner, organize, etc. The usual suspects.   I've done everything from teaching high school to running a coffeehouse, and every job in between. Even went back to school for a degree in graphic art (didn't finish), and lost the job I got at a design firm in town. The problem wasn't getting jobs: it was **keeping** them.   Fast forward to 2007. I was diagnosed with breast cancer, and for a year underwent some draconian treatments - the chemo was harsh. It also destroyed whatever was left of my ability to 'fake it'.  Now...   I now face losing the only job I've managed to hold on to recently: a fairly low-pay, low-demand job. I went from 'one of the best employees' (in management) before cancer to part-time 'sorry we have to cut your hours, you are simply underperforming' in just three years. Lost my benefits as well since I was bumped off of full time. Can't argue my case because my doctor refuses to acknowledge I have a problem, much less intervene.     I can't fake it in an interview anymore so I can't go about looking for a better job with more hours. I can't even manage to match words with the images in my brain. I have trouble completing sentences, and even typing has become a task of 'backspace, correct, backspace, correct' which takes forever. Then I have to re-read what I type so that I can correct any gibberish or wrong word usage that shows up. Every symptom of cognitive problems I had before have increased tenfold. This post has taken more than twenty minutes to type, btw. Close to thirty now.   The problem? My oncologist doesn't believe me. Says he's never heard of chemo brain, and refuses to help me. I have tried other places but was turned away (I suspect when they call him for records or talk to him he tells them that he doesn't believe I have a problem). Finally I called and begged for a referral and got one to a neurology/psychology department. I am praying they will help me and not just assume that I'm 'doctor shopping' for drugs or that I am histrionic. I don't want 'just' drugs. I just want my damned life back.   **TL:DR**, I guess I am hoping to hear from someone who has ADHD/ADD and who has been through chemo, and if there were similar problems. What do you do when the only people who can help you, won't? I live in a small town, there are not other options within reasonable driving distance, unfortunately.
