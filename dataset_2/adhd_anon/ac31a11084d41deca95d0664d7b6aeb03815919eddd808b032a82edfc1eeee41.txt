Sometimes it's hard to remember the positive and it can feel like things are rarely good. **We win every single day.**  We challenge you to write down your wins and see if you feel better looking at the list later in the week. Don’t worry if you miss a day or two or three! Do what you can. Even writing them down one day is a win.  ---  &gt; One thing that comes out in myths is that at the bottom of the abyss comes the voice of salvation. The black moment is the moment when the real message of transformation is going to come. At the darkest moment comes the light.   &gt; — *Joseph Campbell, The Power of Myth*   ---  **Examples from previous weeks:**  * Abstaining from binge drinking for 11 days. Keep it up!  * Worked to overcome their traumatic brain injury and had an awesome week.  * I successfully adulted today.  * I just got through 2 weeks of studying and finals and I did pretty good!  * This weekend I was diagnosed with ADD, and people keep telling me they're sorry -- but I'm ecstatic!   * I just finished my bachelors degree.  ---  #####  We love you, /r/adhd!
