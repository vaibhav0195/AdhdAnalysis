I am newly diagnosed and have been prescribed **Vyvanse** by my new *Psychiatrist*.   I have **not** started it yet.    I also *had* a follow up appointment with my **Family Doctor**.  He suggested I try **Ritalin** *before* I start the **Vyvanse**, so I could get an idea of how stimulants would most likely treat me.  My question is:   Should I try **Ritalin** for a *day*, see how it treats me, and then if it is a positive experience, start the **Vyvanse** the *next* day or two?  **OR**  Should I follow my **Psychiatrists** views and just start the **Vyvanse** and *forget* about the **Ritalin**.  EDIT: Sorry if the formatting is horrible, it took a long time and I am not good at it.    Thanks for any help.
