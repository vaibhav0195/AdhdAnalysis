So she cancelled all the appointments for the following weeks. Mine was one of the cancelled ones. After waiting for more than a month for it. Now the earliest I can get another appointment is in December.  I was diagnosed by my psychologist about two months ago, can't remember if more. He's certain I need medication but can't give it to me. We've been working on coping mechanisms lately but they don't help much. I can't even remember to write things down and have trouble paying attention, even to him.  I don't have health insurance. I have no other psychiatrist to go to, they all give out appointments for late December at the earliest. I had to drop classes and I'm not doing well on the rest, even if I try. I can't read much. And now I'm not even the least bit motivated to keep going.  Ugh I'm so tired.
