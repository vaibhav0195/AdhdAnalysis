I was never able to focus, I was felt like garbage because I would fail at life just because I was bad at math. I thought I would never succeed. Over these few days I was able to do school work. I hope I can fix my poor grades in time. When I see my psychiatrist I will definitely shake his hand he saved my life. I just wanted to share my success story with somebody
