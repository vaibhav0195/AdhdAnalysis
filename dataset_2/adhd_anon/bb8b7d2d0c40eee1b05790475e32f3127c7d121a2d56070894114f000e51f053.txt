bb8b7d2d0c40eee1b05790475e32f3127c7d121a2d56070894114f000e51f053;;;ADHD and at a career crossroads;;;I was diagnosed with ADHD at age 30 a couple of years ago after a disastrous spell in Big 4 accounting.  Right now my career is a cross roads.  I work as a Financial Analyst for a health insurance company and feel things are stuck in neutral.  The position is not the best fit for my skills and interest.  I'm a big picture thinker and inductive learned who will never excel at the details (not horrible at details but it will never be a strength) and feel I'm constantly swimming upstream.  My goal is find a role that build on my financial background (10 years working experience and an MBA) that isn't too much in the weeds all the time and is more big picture focused.  Does anyone have any suggestions?
