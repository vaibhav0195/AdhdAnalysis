First time poster, long time lurker.  A bit about me so it can help you understand what's below: Female, 23 years old, 5'6", 120 lbs.   I was diagnosed with ADHD in December at the age of 23 after being in a psych facility for 2 weeks because of increased depression. After tons of experimenting with dosages, I found that Vyvanse 70 mg is the most effective for me when it comes to concentration and getting work completed. In that time, my anxiety has increased greatly (panic attacks once a month), my heart rate randomly goes up to 125+ bpm at times, shaky hands, getting high blood pressure, weight loss of 15 lbs in 5 months (this I'm okay with). I am also taking Lexapro 10mg for depression.  Today, my psychatrist decreased my dosage to Vyvanse 50 mg and increased Lexapro to 20 mg in the hopes to trying to ween me off of it. She also wants me to consult a cardiologist to see if I need to be completely off of Vyvanse. I do NOT want that to happen because I've never felt so much like an adult until I got on Vyvanse 70 mg. I get so much done at work and even got a promotion! What can I do?  TL;DR: Psych wants to take me off of Vyvanse because of stupid side effects but I've never felt better (mentally) until I got on it.
