I feel more focused, calm and coherent, but i find it really difficult to direct that focus to things i need to be doing instead of pointless activities, and to getting organised/motivated. I'm not too concerned, as i think behavioural therapy will help me to break these issues down a bit (diagnosed at 21 yrs so have some habits i've used as coping strategies- hard to alter behaviour after so long!). But, i've also had a weird experience of being more clear and collected mentally (except for bouts of anxious feelings) but my body is kinda pent up and tensed, like i clench my teeth and my muscles are tensed up ect. I also get super sleepy around dinner time but then wake up again and find it hard to sleep at a reasonable time. Just wondered how others have reacted to concerta in both positive/negative ways, and if they have had a better experience with another med?
