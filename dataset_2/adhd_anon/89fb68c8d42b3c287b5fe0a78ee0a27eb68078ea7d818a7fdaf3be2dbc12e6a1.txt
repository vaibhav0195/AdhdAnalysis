There has been some improvement, but not enough to get her through her school day (she primarily has issues with impulse control).  We're going to switch her to Concerta on his recommendation.  Can someone who's taken both describe the effects for one versus the other?  I know everyone's different but I'd like to get some perspective  on how this change might feel to her, and how well it's worked for others.  Thanks!  EDIT: Thanks everyone for your input.  This subreddit is extremely helpful for me.
