I am not sure if this is time to ask the dr. for another medication or should we continue upping the dose? he is 7 years old and around 60lb.   we are also trying all the diet recommendations in terms of eating all natural and gluten free. what is your experience in the diet side of things?   Thanks all for all the advice.
