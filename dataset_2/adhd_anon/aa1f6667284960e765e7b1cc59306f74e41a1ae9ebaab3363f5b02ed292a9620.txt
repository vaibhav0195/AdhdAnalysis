aa1f6667284960e765e7b1cc59306f74e41a1ae9ebaab3363f5b02ed292a9620;;;Any advice for test taking, particularly  multiple choice;;;I am good at taking tests that you can explain your self in a rational manner and show reasoning but for some reason when it comes to multiple choice i freeze up and get really bad test anxiety and fail horribly. i have an accounting final next Thursday that is all multiple choice, we are given a note card and 2 hours to complete the 11 chapter  comprehensive final. any suggestions or advice that other ADHD'ers have for taking multiple choice tests?  Edit: had a Multiple choice test today and it went well thanks to your advice. i took a little bit of everyones advice and combined it together like a true ADHD person would.
