2cbecb62e3f58dcf1b44dfc82a3f4b406604f35de98a70fbe66b67165760b2a2;;;Reading through my journal entries from ten years ago. I can't believe how obvious it all was.;;;Anyone else feel that the massive, glaring "YOU HAVE ADD MOTHERFUCKER" signs are just so painfully obvious in hindsight? It would have saved me a hell of a lot of trouble if someone had noticed early enough. This probably has a lot to do with what we know about teenage girls being more susceptible to ADHD-PI, which can be hidden for a long time.   Here are some excerpts from age 16-17 (I was finally diagnosed at age 23 when I was at risk of dropping out of university):  3/24/2004  I really don't want to write my math test. Today I felt like I'd rather hand it in blank and not have to write it than try to concentrate on it and pass. I felt like that a lot last semester, and in grade 10. And I swore I wouldn't do it again. Shit. And I don't want to write the script. I want to go to bed, lie awake for a few hours cursing myself for not doing a million things, then fall into a nightmare-filled sleep like I do every night. I mean, why break tradition? I'm so used to not doing my work I've honed my excuses to a perfection never attained by a student before.  5/2/2004  I wonder what things would be like if I had motivation. I could get so much fucking stuff done.   5/13/2004  Why is it that I'd rather sit and stare at the ceiling for hours on end than get up and fucking do something? Why do I stare at my test papers, thinking about what my middle school art teacher told me about graphite and pressure on paper, instead of just fucking concentration on something quasi-important and fucking doing it? It's not that fucking hard. So why is it? Fuck. Why do I overanalyze things like this? What does it accomplish? I always just end up more confused than I began.  7/7/2004  What the fuck am I doing?! I sit around thinking, thinking, thinking and not doing....
