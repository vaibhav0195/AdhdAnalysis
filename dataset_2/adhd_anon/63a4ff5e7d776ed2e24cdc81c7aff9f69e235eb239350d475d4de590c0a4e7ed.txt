AND OMG. this is crazy. I love the fact that I can pay attention to what the teacher says. I only started to lose focus, and get lost in my train of thought in the last 15-20 minutes in the whole 3 hour course. This is huge for me. I am so happy. I wanted to share it.   Thank you /r/ADHD, you have been very supportive so far &amp; I wanted to share this experience with you guys ! :)   &lt;3
