I was diagnosed with ADHD in 2009, I think. It was my senior year of college.  I had some issues when it came to getting in touch with my psychiatrist so after a couple of months I found a new one.   Psych #2 was a learning hospital type program, so I had some sort of graduate student psychiatrist being overseen by a doctor. It basically amounted to me showing up for prescriptions. Around the Christmas before last, they stopped accepting insurance and I couldn't afford it otherwise, so I stopped going.   Now it's been a year and a half without medication, and I've since moved to a new state, found a new job, and in August I'll have new health insurance.   How do I explain the gaps between treatment?  It was a rough year and a half without meds. I basically procrastinated with finding a new doctor. I don't want them to think I can function well without meds, because while I get by, every day is a struggle. I also don't want to give them the impression that I'm "doctor shopping".   Should I just get a new diagnosis? I'm hesitant because the first psychiatrist just said I had ADHD based on my experiences, I didn't do any testing. The second doctor just got my records from the first one.   Anyone have any insight?  Similar experiences?  Thank you!
