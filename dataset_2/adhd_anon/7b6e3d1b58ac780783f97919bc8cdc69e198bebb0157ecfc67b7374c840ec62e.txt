7b6e3d1b58ac780783f97919bc8cdc69e198bebb0157ecfc67b7374c840ec62e;;;Question about first time doctor visit;;;I've been diagnosed with ADHD by a psychologist. My GP prescribes me medication. I called a therapist specializing in treatment today, and the first questions he asked me on the phone were: have you ever had a suicide attempt and (ugg, I forgot. It just happened 10 seconds ago... I think it had something to do with have I ever been hospitalized).  I said no to both, my question is why did he ask these and what would have happened if I said yes?   ---  As a follow up one of my close friends who hasn't been diagnosed but we both strongly suspect it went to a first time doctor visit. But she had been suicidal at a point and the doctor immediately turned her down for an assessment of ADHD (citing that it was commonly diagnosed before 7). The doctor completely ruled out stimulant medication due to her infrequent pot usage and history of alcohol abuse in her family (though she does not abuse alcohol).   Does anyone have explanations for the doctor's actions in both of these scenario's? The latter is more important, because we're both convinced her life would improve from medication, like mine has, but it seems like she's going to be shut out from it. Is there a strong rational for this? Should she be barred from stimulants, or even a diagnosis path to them?
