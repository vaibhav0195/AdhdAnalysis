We are separated now and headed toward divorce, and my therapist suggested that this is likely one of his issues. I've been doing a lot of reading, and it was revelatory. I think we have a chance at reconciliation IF he is willing to be evaluated and embark on a treatment plan, but I'm unsure how to bring this up without making him feel like everything is his fault (which it's not by a long shot). How can I broach the topic with sensitivity, do you think?
