He is a veteran and was diagnosed with adult ADHD while he was in the military, but he's unmedicated. Now he's out in the civilian world and just scraping by financially and socially.   I didn't realize how bad things had gotten for him until last week when his car was reposessed. He recognizes that he's at fault and accepts full responsiblity (and, to his credit, he remedied the situation relatively quickly and got his car back), but I'm worried that he's not going to take the necessary steps (trading in his current SUV for a less expensive car, moving to a smaller home) to get his life back on track.   We separated for a variety of reasons, some of which are my own issues -- but his ADHD symptoms, including extreme financial irresponsibility, didn't help. I bugged him for years to see a professional, but I always got the "Alright, I'll call someone tomorrow." Eventually I stopped asking.   I realize now that I need to be more proactive with him. I love him and I want to see him reach his full potential. He's incredibly smart, funny, and just a generally wonderful guy, but his life is a mess. If you were in his situation, how would you want to be helped? Should I make a therapist appointment for him, or is that condescending?   **tl;dr**: Adult husband has ADHD and won't help himself. What can I do for him?
