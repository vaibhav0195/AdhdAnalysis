408d71caed02395901786bbfdc9820b3eb15f0bb5a3d2e172f934e0f7eb3edc6;;;I want to start reading books more, but I have a hard time finding a book that keeps my attention and wil to read it, what are some you guys might recommend?;;;I just want to add I never really enjoyed reading as a kid too much, I was able to read for essays in high school or whatever and once or twice found a book I would just read the shit out of, I used to collect red wall books cuz they looked nice and all my friends loved them when I was a kid and only really read one. (I felt so terrible I asked my parents for them and could never manage to get past the first few chapters)...   Any books I did read I can never recall things from them, like I mean I'll only every remember one or two main things about the book, but the rest I feel like i just zone out and continue to read without actually absorbing..  I waste a lot of time on my own, and in my free time, so I want to better myself and I feel like reading more can really help me in some aspects of my life, especially since I've been studying engineering for the past 3 years and my connection to literature is pretty much non existent now.   Anyone have ideas of popular books I could read that might get me into books more? I have a taste for many things so I'm open to any suggestions.
