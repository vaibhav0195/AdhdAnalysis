Previously, before I was finally diagnosed and put on focalin, I had scored a horrible 45% on the first exam.   I love my major, Computer Science, but the attention to detail can be killer. I finally felt I was able to take these abstract concepts on paper and actually understand all the parts at once, instead of bits and pieces getting mixed up.  Anyway, I scored a 91.8% on that test Friday. I worried about passing this class and now I know I will be receiving at least a B. It excites me as to what I might accomplish next semester, when I can start the semester this way.
