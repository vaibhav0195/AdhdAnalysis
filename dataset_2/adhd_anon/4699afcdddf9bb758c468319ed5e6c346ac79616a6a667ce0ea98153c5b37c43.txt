Still, this is a post dedicated to all those whom have knowingly / unknownly supported and dealt with me for all these years; I have learned so much from you.  So, to you my friends, family, colleagues and acquaintances, here’s my thanks to you.  I’ll keep this short and simple.  **1) Patience – To Forgive and Proceed**  As inappropriate as this sounds socially, I have the patience of Jesus.  I have been cheated on, betrayed, but strangely over the years I’ve forgiven them all.  Actually, it’s not the years, but within moments.  I learned that nothing can be solved by holding on to the past.  Perhaps, it is a blessing in disguise that I don’t remember much of it, or the impact doesn’t linger with me long enough to hold your mistakes against the future.  Is that better? I don’t know and I don’t care.  What matters is moving forward. Sure, you may betray or hurt me again, but I am wise enough to know that there’s no future to build upon if I keep letting the past affect the decision towards a better future.  If you fuck up again, it’ll eat you up inside way harder than I or you’ll truly demonstrate your apathy towards me.  Either way, there will be an answer; I am not hung up on needing one now.  People can forgive your forgetfulness, your weirdness, your white-lies, your inability to keep promises; but they’ll never forgive anger.  And I have that under control.  **2) Heart – Acceptance and the State of being Open-Minded.** We see the world in different possibilities because we naturally run off the tangents, drawing links that otherwise wouldn’t make sense to anyone else.  I’ve always felt for the minority, the outcast, the rejects and failures, I now understood that the kindness stems from understanding my limitations and the internal clockwork that defines me.  I don’t discriminate the fats, hate on the LGBTs, or close myself off to anyone that doesn’t speak to my language and needs. I always speak from the heart because I can’t exactly count on what my mind tells me.  Especially with all the variation and social cleavages, sometimes you just need to have the gift to faith to understand and embrace something with just an ELI5.  Explaining ADHD to non-believers is difficult, but through the lessons I also learned how to target my crowd.  I don’t need a bullet-proof argument filled with scientific evidence to believe something is true; sometimes your body language, your voice, your eyes and expressions tells me enough.  Maybe this will dick me in the end, but if as people say relationship (or success) are built on the understanding of compassion in one another, then in this spectrum, I am far ahead of you, commoners.  **3) Most importantly, discovering my place in this world.** A wise man once said, “Don’t judge a dolphin by its ability to climb trees”  In some ways, I came to the understanding that I am much more effective as a leader than a follower. My condition just doesn’t quite allow me to follow your directions to the dot, and I apologize for that. My friends count on my hyper-activeness to bring atmosphere when the room is dull, up when others are down.  Because of my condition, I hyper-focus in my thousands of interests, and I am always happy to exchange and share insights because we experience a different life, like people who read the same book but developed different conclusions. For what it is worth, I am the variation that exists to serve you, the balance to the group dynamics.  I may never be in your “in crowd” sharing identical characteristics, to give you the feeling of “home”, but you’ll always remember me as your bridge to the other side when needed.  And in this sense, I am the bridge that brings ideas and people whom otherwise wouldn’t be together with, together.  Only a handful of people I’ve met tops me on this, all of whom I respect and it is my motivation to keep developing to the best of my abilities.     Because I have a disability, I am stronger than you’ll ever imagine. Because I have a disability, I had the need to develop in areas that you don’t.  And even with a disability, it doesn’t mean that there aren’t lessons to be learnt and teach to others.  I am 28 this year.  There are lots of resentment and regret for not treating this condition earlier.  But please remember this, as quoted by John Lennon, “Time you enjoy spending is not time wasted”.  Remember the love and support given to you.  Don’t let anyone beat you down, walk your own path because we were born to do so.  Thank you.
