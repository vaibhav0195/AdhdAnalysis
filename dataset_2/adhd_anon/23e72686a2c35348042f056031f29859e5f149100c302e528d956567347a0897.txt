I like the simplicity off [*time timer*](https://www.timetimer.com/) clocks, that i have a model of,  but it is just to easy to ignore.   I want something that I can put in the corner of the room, so I have to walk over to it, force myself to stop the activity I am undertaking and take a pause. It needs to be able to repeat when I turn the alarm signal off.   [**Time timer watch**](https://www.timetimer.com/collections/watches/products/time-timer-watch-plus-large) I am thinking about the time timer watch, but it might too be to easy to ignore. If anyone has tried it: How long does it beep/vibrate?  I don't really want an app, but if you can find an app that meets my previous requirements and is simple, suggest it.
