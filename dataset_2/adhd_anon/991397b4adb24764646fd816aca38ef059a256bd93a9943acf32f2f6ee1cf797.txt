Also, both my parents are adhd.  Anyways, I have basically all the symptoms of adhd/add, from the random depression, racing thoughts, hyperfocus, trouble focusing, *horrible* memory, cluttered/messy, super sensitive, low self-esteem, random anger bursts, talking to much, and the list goes on.   Getting off track here, okay, so I'm in my second year of college and I didn't do too fantastic my second semester.  So I'm looking for help on how to stay focus when I'm trying to study. And no, I don't want medication. I believe that you can harness the power of adhd/add and use it to make yourself better.   So, how do I study and not be bored out of my mind? How can I focus??  Thank you!
