I explained it to a friend like this. "Imagine that my brain is a big jar of bees. The bees are thoughts, buzzing around and smashing into each other. Then, I want to send some your way, so the bees start flying through a straw to get out of the jar. Then two bees try to go into the straw at the same time, or out of order, and I have to wait and restart the stream of thoughts."  Another time, I explained it like so. "Imagine that thoughts are wires, like power cords. Most people have them neatly coiled, waiting to be thought about, or plugged in on both ends, neatly running from inspiration to conclusion. I instead have all of them running everywhere all the time. Plugged into splitters, combiners, plug strips, etc. When you want to think a thought into words, you just grab one and pull it out. I, however, have to untangle it from all the others. It takes a moment to separate it, because my mouth can only say one at a time."    Another time, I said this. "I think about things abstractly. I don't use words in my head. When I want to describe something, I have to isolate the whole thought, then carefully translate it into English. It's great, because I can think really fast. It just means I'm slow to share my thoughts."    TL:DR I (we!) are really smart, we just have to work to translate to English.
