fe9c5374dce265c62bc2daef5c975abb6d767f61c455c3ea6135dbc4f634c319;;;(UK) May have ADD (in addition to Aspergers), opinions on Ritalin?;;;I have Aspergers and have been seeing a psychologist about my depression/lack of motivation. He's fairly certain I have (Inattentive-type) ADD, which I've suspected for years, though says under current rules of diagnosis a diagnosis of comorbid autism/ADD isn't possible (don't know why...). Anyway, this opens up a lot of options medication-wise if the psychiatrist I'm seeing in a fortnight agrees and offers to prescribe me stimulants.  I've been self-prescribing Modafinil for almost a year now with good results, it stops me from being so tired all the time and aids focus but I've tried ritalin-like drugs before (ethylphenidate) and Modafinil is no comparison to the motivational qualities of these drugs though they also have their side effects like addictive qualities and comedowns. The psych said I may be offered to continue prescribed, NHS-quality Modafinil or even switched to ritalin or other more ADD-aimed drugs (not adderall because UK though). I'm just looking for some different opinions on Ritalin if it's offered to me. In short, I'd love to be more motivated, but concerned about addiction/crashing/general uncleanness of these stimulants.
