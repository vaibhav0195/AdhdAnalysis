I didn't know this existed. So I went. Got there at 10 and saw a guy at 3.  They had asked me a bunch of questions previously of course, but they didn't seem to have access to my medical file and didn't seem to take adhd seriously at all. He asked me what I wanted to do. I did not expect this. I asked him what he thought and he said therapy sounded like what would help the most.  I think if I'd asked for now adhd medication he might have tried one, but I was totally taken aback at the idea of making that sort of decision. I said I couldn't trust myself to make that decision. And that was that. I left.  Not like it matters now, but if I were ever to have access to any sort of adhd treatment, it was through this appointment. I blew it. That was it.  Guess I have to just cope. Maybe I don't have adhd anyway. You know, despite being diagnosed twice.  Why am I such an idiot. Where is the nearest bridge?  Edit: this is a fairly large overreaction.  I was angry. I'm sorry, I do realize that therapy will probably help, even if it takes weeks, and that for now it couldn't hurt to learn to cope.
