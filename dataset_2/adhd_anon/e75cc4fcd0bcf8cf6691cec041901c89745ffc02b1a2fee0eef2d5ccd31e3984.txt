e75cc4fcd0bcf8cf6691cec041901c89745ffc02b1a2fee0eef2d5ccd31e3984;;;Adderall, alcohol, and headaches;;;Hey guys  I am a 20 y/o female, diagnosed with ADHD last fall and have been taking Adderall almost every day for 2 months. Currently taking 20 mg XR. I usually take it sometime between 8 and 10 am.   My question is about alcohol. I'm in college and I drink most weekends. I don't take Adderall on the weekends though, so obviously haven't had any interactions then. But there have been a few week days I've taken my Adderall in the morning, and then had a few drinks in the evening. Today, for example, I took the Adderall at 8:30 am and had a beer around 6 pm. Before I was even halfway through the beer I got a pounding and throbbing headache. I've done this once or twice before and experienced the exact same thing.   I try to drink a lot of water and make sure I eat during the day, so I don't think it's being caused by dehydration or lack of food. I tried taking some Advil, laying down, drinking more water, but nothing helps at all and it just gets worse and worse. I have no other "symptoms", just the headache.   I have tried to do some research on my own, but couldn't find much of anything relating specifically to headaches. I know that Adderall + alcohol is generally a bad combination, but am I not even going to be able to have 1 beer on the days I take Adderall? Has anyone else experienced this? Any advice?   Thanks!
