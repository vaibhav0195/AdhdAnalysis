071927f644fd5badc31f62eea368a4a5187f7bd56abd4bee19582a01f9f972f2;;;So I made an Illustration for an art gallery about being an artist living with A.D.D;;;Text from the Didactic and Description of Art:   For this exhibition, we were asked to create a personal narrative piece. We were asked to tell a story we have never been able to tell before. I decided to make a very personal piece about what it is like to live as an illustrator with Attention Deficit Disorder. The center of the illustration shows my work space, the boarder of the illustration depicts a comic showing the cycles of procrastination, distraction, anxiety, extreme frustration, and desperation that comes from even trying to complete a simple task while suffering from A.D.D. The work-space illustration shows exactly how I organize my dinning room when I am working on artwork.  See Full Artwork Here: https://www.behance.net/gallery/48990729/LIGHT-GREY-ART-LAB-TOBEYOU
