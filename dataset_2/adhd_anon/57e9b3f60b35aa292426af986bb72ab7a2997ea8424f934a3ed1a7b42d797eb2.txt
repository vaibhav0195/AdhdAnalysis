Same with my inability to work more than 60 hours per month. And my sleep problems are unrelated.  Welcome to Europe! /s  Sorry, had to get that off my chest. I knew it might end that way, but somehow I still feel helpless. Anyone else had this kind of experience, where doctor uses outdated ADHD definition? Any methods to cope?
