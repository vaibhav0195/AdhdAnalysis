I've been reflecting a lot on my ADD lately, how it effects me, what symptoms I can attribute to it, and what I can do to improve myself. The more I think, and reflect, the more I realize that this has gotten progressively worse over time.  When I was young, like 7 I could pay attention to things for hours at a time non stop, I was able to dedicate hours to practicing and exploring things just for the sake of self improvement and curiosity, and other than some hyperactivity I was a normal, well-rounded kid who did normal kid things.   Now, I can't even sit through a tv show without realizing that my mind has wandered somewhere else and I haven't absorbed anything. In movies where I used to be able to immerse myself in the storyline and forget I was in a theatre, I now find myself wondering when they're going to be over, or how long I've been there, or whether or not my cat's ruined anything while I've been gone.  Tried to read a book, quit on page 3 after realizing that I got caught up reading 4 or 5 different lines for 2-3 minutes at a time, whereas 10 year old me was able to read complete novels in one sitting and follow the plot without distraction.   As I'm writing this I'm reminded that I can't even concentrate long enough to write a complete sentence without reading it over to make sure that I'm still on the same train of thought. When I was 12 I wrote 20+ poems and 5 short stories over the summer break.   Everything I've read about ADD/ADHD says you're either born with it, or you don't have it and never will. What the fuck is happening to me?!
