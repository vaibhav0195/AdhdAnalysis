Yesterday was the first day of summer. It was also the same day that my mother, who is not a doctor, decides to "detox" me. Yesterday, I woke up at 11 am feeling fine, with a just a slight headache. 3 pm was when things started going to shit. The headache became throbbing and my body started aching and I was sweating. I told my mother that I was in pain, and she said, "you need to take a break off of this stuff, your too skinny." When I asked for a small dose to take the pain away, she got mad and said, "you sound like a junky!". My mother comes from a family of addicts; her dad, my dad, and her siblings are all addicts/alcoholics. Because she is the only "clean" person in the family, she sees herself as superior to the rest of us. However I am not a junky. I have diagnosed adhd and use adderall to feel normal and function in day to day life. She knows nothing about "detoxing". She holds the meds and locks them up, just like she locks up the alcohol cabinet when my grandfather visits. I have been awake all night sweating, tossing, and turning. I am going to discuss with her a more gradual tapper plan today. I am 18 years old for christ sake! This is under no medical supervision, how is this okay?  Edit: Thank you all for the strong and rational information, It is very helpful and means a lot.  Edit: Last dose taken 30 hours before real pain started. Low dose (10xr or 15ir) a day for the last 9 months.   Edit: Thank you all, Mom researched about stopping meds abruptly and apologized, she admitted she was ignorant. I told her this was illegal and now I am going to gradually taper. I feel better now, as I took a dose this morning.
