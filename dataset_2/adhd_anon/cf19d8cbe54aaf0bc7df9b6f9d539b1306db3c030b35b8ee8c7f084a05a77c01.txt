With Vyvanse I can remember A LOT more, and am very detail-oriented and say so much/write such long sentences i lose people. I struggle so hard to cut out the irrelevant information a lot of the time so my writings and answers to detailed questions are a total memory dump. How do you speak and write concisely with adhd?I can handle normal conversations fine and theyre great it's just the other stuff.
