acca2093df4862f22086545177c9bae5dda6bba95330ea50bed355c24a589450;;;Just scheduled my psychiatrist appointment, but so far away...;;;I just got a call back from a psychiatrist to schedule my appointment, but they scheduled it for August 1. My problem is mainly that I don't have enough meds (Strattera 40mg) to last me that long. I'm not going to go back to my old MD for a refill (which is a [whole other story](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/20nhsx/sketchy_diagnosis_but_medication_helps_should_i/)).  Because of the way the clinic handles appointments, I could fill someone else's canceled appointment, but there's no guarantee.   Does anyone have any suggestions to help me keep my ADHD at bay between now and then? Any suggestions in general?
