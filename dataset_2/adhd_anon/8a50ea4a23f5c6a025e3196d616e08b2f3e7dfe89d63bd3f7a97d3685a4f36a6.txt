Wrong diagnosis?;;;I was diagnosed with adult adhd a couple of months ago and am now taking 35mg of Ritalin twice a day, I usually only take one dose. I'm not sure if I really do have adhd as I'm not usually one to be hyperactive. I am very forgetful and have no attention span and can never get anything done but could that just be a result of pure laziness?
