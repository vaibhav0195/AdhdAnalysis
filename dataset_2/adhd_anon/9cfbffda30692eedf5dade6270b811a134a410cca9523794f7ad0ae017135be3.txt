Tried 15mg, it was great for studying/cramming/doing essays, then 20mg worked even better and longer for a year or so. Couldn't try IR since Canada doesn't have them apparently, tried crushing up the xr beads into powder but they only worked once in a while. It gave me insomnia for the first year no matter how early I took it, always had to be careful with what foods (avoided citrus, juices, waited an hour if I ate before taking it and took a tums with it too)  I ate before lol and whether or not I exercised that day. Oh and I ALWAYS had to take breaks in between, so like 3-4 days of taking it a week or else I built up tolerance so fast. It also made me crave cigarettes so much and also wanting to go out to drink after. Oh and got some blurred vision and like felt like I was "hallucinating stuff" at times ugh and gave me heart palpitations some days.    **Dexedrine 5mg Tabs - Oct 2014-Jan 2014 on and off**: 2014 Sucked I thought I got a bad batch or something,but eventually had to take like 5 pills+ to feel remotely close to the focus/concentration I had with adderall xr 15mg/20mg at the time but it lasted for like an hour lmao. Great focus/concentration but felt paranoid after it wore off.   **Dexedrine 15mg Spansules - Nov 2014-Jan 2014 on and off**: 2014 Worked excellent, felt the calmness/focus but after a week I had to add in one dexedrine 5mg  to make it work for 3-4 hours. Great focus/concentration but felt paranoid after it wore off, gave me heart palpitations.    **Vyvanse - Feb 2015 - Dec 2015**: Got 40mg, the only adhd drug that I got the least anxiety before, during and after taking the pill and didn't feel like I was "on something". BEST part is that it doesn't matter what the fuck, or when the fuck I eat stuff haha, and it comedowns were for the most part smooth, though some days still got imsonia. Although 40mg doesn't work as well as 60mg anymore which is annoying since I was only on 40mg for 3-4 months. I quit smoking because of this and eventually even drinking I've stopped having urges to go out. Never got hallucinations or blurry vision during the comedowns either. Also I seem to be able to talk to people with less self-consciousness, but at the same time I feel calmer on it so I don't OVERshare that much like on adderall xr, helped with my impulsiveness. However there are still days where 60mg feels like it isn't as long lasting if I don't have much planned to do you know?   **TL;DR**: Argh, but yeah long story short, finally got diagnosed but the doctor put me on 5mg adderall xr (I've taken all of the above bolded above for studying from friends' on campus) and she told me try it for 2-4 doses once a day for two weeks, seeing her again on Monday to tell her it works well. However two days it was ok, then it sucks cause it barely lasts and it feels like a "tease" where the first 1-2 hours is amazing, and I get the blurry vision, mild hallucinations and anxiousness to talk to people or be outside walking alone, etc. after the 1-2hours, then it dies down and I can't focus and feel mildly depressed/anxious/irritated. WAS SO ANNOYED cause I had two papers due that week, so I just took 30mg xr to try, still barely worked lmao so I just went back to my leftover supply of vyvanse 60mg and it helped immensely again to focus and complete my papers thank god. This is probably because I've tried a ton of stuff before and actually "been on" adderall xr for almost two years on and off along with the other various shit I've gotten. Really don't want to tell her my side effects and she won't try vyvanse then.. argh. ANYWAYS does this sound like your guys' experiences? LOL
