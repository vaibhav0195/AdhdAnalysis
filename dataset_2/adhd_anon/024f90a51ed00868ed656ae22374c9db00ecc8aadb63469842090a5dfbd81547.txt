I've finally worked up enough courage to see a family doctor (specializes in ADHD, amongst other things). This is a new doctor as I have changed insurances recently. I struggled with alcohol addiction and have a few arrests as result. I'm 3 years sober now. Should I bring this up at the appointment? Will this limit his ability to properly treat me if I'm diagnosed? I'm 24m.
