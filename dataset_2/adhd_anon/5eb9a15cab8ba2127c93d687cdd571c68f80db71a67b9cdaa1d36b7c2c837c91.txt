Basically, is there a "you should pretty much start with this medication and tweak from there"? I was prescribed Vyvanse from the get-go (I'm 21, newly diagnosed) and know several people who were also prescribed Vyvanse right away.  I then ran into a few other people that claim you should never start with a long-acting drug and that "everyone" starts with Adderall IR and adjusts from there.  What do you guys think?
