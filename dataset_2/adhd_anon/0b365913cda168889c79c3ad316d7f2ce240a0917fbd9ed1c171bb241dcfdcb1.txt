This is apparently something exclusive to us "blessed" with ADHD. Anyway, my favorite time it happened to me was in 2nd grade when we had a reading time in the middle of the day. I got so enveloped in my book that I didn't even notice the teacher telling me to stop reading. I only stopped reading when I finished the book and the class was in the middle of a math lesson.
