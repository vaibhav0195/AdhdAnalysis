The first med I took was Ritalin which was tolerable in terms of side effects but it made me nervous and would make my social anxiety worse at times. The next med I tried was Adderall which I like better than Ritalin but It still brings on anxiety and plus it's almost impossible for me to sleep at night.  For the past 3 months I haven't touched stims at all and I am having trouble focusing in school. I'm thinking of trying out Dexedrine IR because it seems it doesn't bring on as much anxiety as other stims and sleep isn't as much as an issue.  What do you guys think about Adderall vs. Dexedrine?
