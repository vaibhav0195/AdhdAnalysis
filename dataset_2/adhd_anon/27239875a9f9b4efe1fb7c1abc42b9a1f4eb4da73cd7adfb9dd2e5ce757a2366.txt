27239875a9f9b4efe1fb7c1abc42b9a1f4eb4da73cd7adfb9dd2e5ce757a2366;;;When (over)planning becomes procrastination. How to cope with this? Any strategies/tips welcome;;;So I feel like this is a recurrent problem for ADHD people: we plan too much, and we never get to actually do our things.   For me, this usually involves changing my planning system. For instance: I had a perfectly good, working system set up on trello and google calendar, but last week I just decided it would be a great idea to move to pen-and-paper and started a Bullet Journal. Now I spend most of my day planning things on my BuJo and never actually do them. And I know that when the BuJo starts working, I'll probably move into other things...   Also, theres the "overplanning" aspect to it, when you just break tasks down over and over again and end up with a super detailed step-by-step to your tasks, instead of just doing them.   How do you people cope with this? What's your strategy to reduce (or completely stop) this?    EDIT: tl;dr: what do you do when you start spending most of your time planning things instead of doing them?
