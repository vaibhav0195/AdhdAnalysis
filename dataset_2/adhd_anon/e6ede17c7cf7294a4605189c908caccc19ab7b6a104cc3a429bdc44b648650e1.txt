I'm in the perfect position to get this done but I just don't. I really need to do something. I'm not even really feeling motivated to write this at the moment, so I'm half assing it but I'm hoping something will kick me in the ass. What's wrong with me? I'm 27 years old and the only job I've kept longer than six months is the one I have right now which lets me sit and watch Netflix all night while everyone is sleeping. I know I could better, but I don't.   I am starting to see it affect my relationship with my wife now too. I went on a rampage and had a full meltdown today because I couldn't find my glasses. I still haven't found them and now I have to go find another set. My wife hated me for the rest of the day and I can't say that I blame her. Now we have to go get new glasses tomorrow, and the only thing reason I am going is because she is pushing me to go.
