bd56cc1da3e8198959cf51e4506dbb0cddc08940fa84c9e16a978525f34294e6;;;smoking and adderall?;;;Ive taken various stimulants to treat my ADD from age 14 to current (21). i started smoking cigarettes when I turned 18 and got addicted pretty quickly. i can turn them down when im my usual ADD self, but if i take my adderall, I end up chain smoking all day and feeling horrible. anybody else notice this on stimulants? is this due to the increased dopamine on addie?  thanks for any help, im new to reddit right now, but im really starting to dig this community.
