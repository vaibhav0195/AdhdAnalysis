Whenever I think I might not be ADHD I think about this.   Do people who are not ADHD react to stimulant medication like people with ADHD do?  For example, I take my Adderall every day. Of course at first I had that honeymoon phase, but never felt hyped up or even stimulated really. Since its been 5 months I normally can't tell I've taken it. My appetite is fine and I'm obviously just more relaxed and not all over the place. (And my grades have improved tremendously... But that's beside the point!)  If someone who doesn't have ADHD took Adderall/Vyvanse every day for 5 months would they have the exact same effect? Does this mean I might not be ADHD just bc my doctor diagnosed me with it there really isn't a way to know for sure? I had a nurse tell me she can tell I have it because I'm more calm on stimulants but would this happen to someone who didn't have ADHD?  TLDR; does every day stimulant use have the same effect on people with and without ADHD?
