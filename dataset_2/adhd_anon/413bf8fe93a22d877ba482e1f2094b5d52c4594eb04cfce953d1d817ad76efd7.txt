What should I expect?;;;I made a post probably about a month ago about my struggles and how I realized I could have ADHD. Well, over fall break I got tested back home and I was officially diagnosed (just the inattentive sub-type) and put on Concerta. So I've been on it about a week. Classes just started today for me. I don't know what I'm supposed to be feeling. I want to think it's working but I don't know what to expect.   The only feeling that is different is that I feel like I'm breathing lighter, but it's very slight. I don't notice a difference with anything else yet.
