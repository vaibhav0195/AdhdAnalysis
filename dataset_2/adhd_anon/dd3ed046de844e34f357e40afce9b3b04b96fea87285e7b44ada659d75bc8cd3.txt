Earlier I submitted a comment in the Momentum Monday post about how I was several weeks behind in my AP US History notes, and how I set out a plan to get it all done before it was due.  Although I'm a little behind, I'm almost fully caught up, and with a week to spare!  Had this been not even two months ago (I was diagnosed a little more than a month ago) I probably would have nothing by now, even though it's due this week.  This week I was able to adhere to a strict plan (except two days, where things got a little messed up) and pull through.  I'm being distracted by making this post (bad, I know) so I'm gonna get back to work, but I just thought I'd share with you guys!

My doctor prescribed me taking two doses a day, 20 mg each dose, in the morning and in the afternoon.  This means that I need to have 60 capsules for every month, but our insurance does not allow that (they cap it at 30 a month).  * A possible solution we came up with is to try to get the 40 mg capsules and have me take half a capsule a day, keeping with the 30 capsules a day that our insurance allows.  The problem lies with how I'm going to be able to take exactly half of the capsule in the first place.  * What we came up with is using a water bottle with volume measurements and filling it to a certain point.  We would then pour the contents of the capsule into the water bottle and have me drink half of it for my first dose and the other half later on for my second dose.  * Now, I'm not a biochemist or anything, but I'm aware that water is a universal solvent.  What we're worried about is that if we put the contents of the capsule in water it will denature the medication and its effectiveness.  This concern is mostly for the second dose, which would be sitting in the water for several hours until my second dose.  * **Here's my question: If you put the powdered contents of the medication capsule (Vyvanse) in water for extended periods of time, will the medicine cease to function?**
