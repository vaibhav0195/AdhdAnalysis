I've been on ritalin now for about 5 weeks or so and have settled on about 40mg, spaced out through four pills day. I've noticed that the effect has ... moderated somewhat after the first few weeks and am wondering how the guys in this forum deal with getting to a tolerance level with adhd drugs more generally.   I'm thinking of things like not taking them on weekends, or taking less some days for instance.  Does this help to keep the effect at optimal when we take them during the week?
