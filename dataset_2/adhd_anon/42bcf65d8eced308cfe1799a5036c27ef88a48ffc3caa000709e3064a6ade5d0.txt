42bcf65d8eced308cfe1799a5036c27ef88a48ffc3caa000709e3064a6ade5d0;;;UK Diagnosis w/ Uncooperative Parents?;;;I have heard that the UK adult diagnostic process is somewhat difficult. Is it going to be possible to do this without my parents' involvement? I don't have a great relationship with them, and they are very anti-medication/doctors. I doubt I can even get hold of old school reports - so is the whole thing just going to be a waste of time?
