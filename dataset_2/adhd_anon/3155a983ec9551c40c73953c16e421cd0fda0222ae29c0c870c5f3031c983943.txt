3155a983ec9551c40c73953c16e421cd0fda0222ae29c0c870c5f3031c983943;;;You got this!;;;I just wanted to drop in here and say a quick (hopefully) thank you to all of you in this community.  I'm a 27 year old woman...and I've always felt completely fucked...like 100 damaged and broken. Reading through all of the posts here has been surreal.   Like many you my life has been a series of stops and starts...6 months here 6 months there with huge fuck ups in between. Latest one was getting black out drunk which devolved into calling an ex from the bar to come get me, demanding I have a bath, and the most cringe worthy part...oh God it hurts to type this...using his roommates razor to shave because i wanted to have sex with him (ahhh gross gross gross that makes my blood run cold) Ironically im a huge germ phobe and would never do that sober. This night was followed by like 48 hours googling how I mostdefinetlyhaveaids. And feeling like a general disgusting shameful person.  I did however, ring in the new year sober and plan on staying that way. I start meds tomorrow and am looking forward to a brighter future.  What I actually came here to say...  I feel you guys so hard. It's fucking hard and I hate that i struggled for so long not knowing why the fuck I do this shit! And why I couldn't get it together.  And yes I know.  I am responsible for my decisions. But damn man you do the fucking best you can!   Anywayyy...  Be nice to yourselves. You've managed this far while facing a fucking avalanche of resistance from your own brain (you were supposed to be on my side brain!)   Forgive yourselves and stop beating yourselves up (easy to say and hard to do I know) there's only the future the past is gone. Be nice to yourselves and keep on keeping on.  If a dirty razor thief can forgive herself so can you.  Okay that was NOT short.  Sending happy vibes to everyone :)))
