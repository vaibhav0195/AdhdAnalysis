For 5 minutes ill play the Xbox then want to watch YouTube, open up 100 tabs of videos i want to watch and then watch 2 minutes of the first one and close my laptop, then play with my dog ect. Does this happen to you?

Most of the time it is irrelevant stuff but i just keeping going.  Although sometimes i get terrible writers block and can't think of a single word. Can you relate to any of this?

I find throughout the day i can either be extremely hyper or extremely sleepy. My thoughts are still racing through my head, i am just not wanting to move all the time.  I know that is not exactly on track to my initial question.   Are you 24/7 hyperactive?   Do you go on a roller coaster of energy throughout the day?  and in general do you see any of your symptoms change throughout the day?
