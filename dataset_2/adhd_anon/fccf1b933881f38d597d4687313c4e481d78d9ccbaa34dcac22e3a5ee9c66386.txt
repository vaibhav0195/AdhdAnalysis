I tend to have all the general symptoms: disorganization, procrastination, erratic behavior, unable to focus, etc. The biggest issue I've learned to discover as a result is my self-esteem issues. As a child, I've always been moderately shy. But now that I am an adult, I have a very difficult time in social settings. I find it very difficult to approach or develop the confidence to talk to girls. I also have little success in making friends. People would call me reserved but the sad truth is that I'm not, I'm aching to branch out but I can't because my confidence is so low that I cannot bring myself to do it. Often me and my mom will talk about this and we don't really agree and I usually get very frustrated talking about it. Most conversations about it turn into arguments and result in me throwing/breaking things or saying things I don't mean in anger. I also might add that I have a HUGE anger problem. I was wondering from any redditors with ADHD: how do you guys deal with self esteem issues as a result of ADHD? May this just be a result of some other disorder or a lack of self-confidence in general? Should I try to use a different medication?   Edit: Spelling
