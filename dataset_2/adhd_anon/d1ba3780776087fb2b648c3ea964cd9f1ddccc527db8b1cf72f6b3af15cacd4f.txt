Despite all the problems I've had in life, they've been encouraging and wonderful to me through everything.  Except when, several years ago, I tried talking to my parents about ADHD. I tried to explain that all the problems they continually notice about me follow the exact outline for ADHD-PI, to which they responded that ADHD isn't real, it's a trick for parents to drug their children instead of teaching them discipline, that if I even tried talking to a doctor about it I would end up addicted to methamphetamines, etc.  It was probably the worst single event of my life. I don't blame my parents, because I love them dearly and I know they think they're doing the best for me... but I saw an ADHD specialist last week, and after talking for a few hours he told me he thought I should try taking 10 mg of Adderall XR, and to talk to my parents about it afterwards.  So now I need to talk to my family about this, but I don't know how to. I've never been more depressed or self ashamed than when I mentioned possibly seeing a specialist years ago - and I can only imagine their reaction to this will be much worse.  I don't know how to talk with them. I think they will tell me they'd rather I fail college off medication than ace it on medication. I think they will tell me again that it'll lead to a life of drug abuse - despite my doctor giving me only 10 mg of the extended release.  I don't know what to do, because I know they firmly believe ADHD isn't real. Can anyone please spare some advice on what I can even do at this point? I'd really appreciate it - thank you.  *Tl;dr, Parents don't believe ADHD is real, got incredibly mad at me and over reacted when I considered seeking help. Now I've been diagnosed and have no idea how to tell them, help?*
