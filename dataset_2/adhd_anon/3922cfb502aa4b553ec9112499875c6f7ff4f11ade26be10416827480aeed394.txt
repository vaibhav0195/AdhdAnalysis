3922cfb502aa4b553ec9112499875c6f7ff4f11ade26be10416827480aeed394;;;The process of disclosing ADHD and medication use for future employment?;;;So I'm studying programming/web development and ill be applying for jobs at a bunch of startups and corporate companies in the upcoming months.   Since I was recently diagnosed with adhd I was wondering what the process is like when it comes to drug testing and if there's actually an unwritten stigma behind hiring people with adhd taking meds. What has your experience been like?
