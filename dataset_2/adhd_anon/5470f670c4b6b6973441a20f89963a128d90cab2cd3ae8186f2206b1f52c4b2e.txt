Could use your experience and advice.;;;Hello all,  I was diagnosed by with ADD a few months ago, and have seen a drastic improvement in my life since being prescribed Adderall XR accompanying a lot of lifestyle changes.  I just recently finished a psychiatric assessment which resulted with me being ADHD with very minor hyperactive, as well as having a generalized anxiety. When I asked the doctor about the possibility of a longer lasting medication, he told me that he'll be recommending  Vyvance 30mg to my GP in place of Adderall XR 15mg.   I have been reading up on this subject, and was hoping anyone who has had a run with both of these drugs could offer me some advice in regards to your compared experience.  My only major issues that I have with Adderall at the moment is the seemingly progressive loss in appetite, unpredictable up time, as well as the unpredictable, and sometimes rather steep come down. Mind you, I have found Adderall to be effective in parts of my life other than ADD, namely a decrease in social anxiety and depression and I would like to see that remain if possible.  Thank-you so much in advance, this sub has been a great source of knowledge for me, and I’m hoping to learn just a little more with this post.  I understand your experience and mine may differ, but I’d like to at least know a few things I may experience from the switch.  Grey
