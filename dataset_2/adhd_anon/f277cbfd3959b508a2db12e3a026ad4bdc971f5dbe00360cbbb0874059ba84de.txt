f277cbfd3959b508a2db12e3a026ad4bdc971f5dbe00360cbbb0874059ba84de;;;i find my thought process and hyper-focus super exhausting and often avoid tasks that i know will cause my brain to turn fully ON;;;i am really curious if anyone else experiences this.   i often find myself avoiding tasks because i don't know if i have the energy to deal with the dramatics of my brain. i love academic inquiry but i often really dread delving into anything more than a news article because i become so involved, so fast. the eventual, inevitable interruption -- from friends, family, or just the library closing -- is so jarring that i actively fear it.   anyone else..?
