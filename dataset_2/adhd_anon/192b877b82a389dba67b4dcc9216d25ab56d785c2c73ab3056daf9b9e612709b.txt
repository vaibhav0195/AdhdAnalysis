192b877b82a389dba67b4dcc9216d25ab56d785c2c73ab3056daf9b9e612709b;;;MUST WATCH: An excellent ADHD researcher Dr. Russel Barkley explain almost everything you need to know about ADHD in few short videos! (links in the post);;;[It's a trap!](http://cdn.instanttrap.com/trap.jpg) Ok, it's more than just a few videos but they are all short (1-6 mins) and they are very informative, my understanding of ADHD was more improved by these several videos than most of the other ADHD material i have seen.

I personally do not think that ADHD has only downside and I don't think he does either. But you have to understand that first of all, he is a doctor and a researcher and that is the attitude in which he approaches ADHD, he knows what he needs to say in order to get the support and funding to help ADHD people.The problem is not that ADHD is not anything more than just a set of disorders, the problem is that it is perceived to be so in today's educational, social and occupational system, where the upsides of ADHD overlooked and disregarded.**   For example :  * majority of the population are early birds whereas ADHD people are usually night owls   * majority of the population can focus on and do well what they *need*, ADHD people can only focus on and do well what they *like*, but if they are enabled to do so, they are really, really good at it  * normal brain can only focus on what is the actual issue at the given moment, ADHD brain tends to process multiple information at once  And many more...  The thing is that ADHD is not that much of a *serious disorder*, the thing is that it is manufactured that way by simple fucked up - one-way system focused on as much regularity as possible, stomping individuality and creativity, to better understand this, **i highly recommend you guys to go watch these videos, they are essential for understanding of what ADHD people need from education**:  * [Sir Ken Robinson - School Kills Creativity](http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html)  * [Sir Ken Robinson - Bring On The Revolution](http://www.ted.com/talks/sir_ken_robinson_bring_on_the_revolution.html)  * [Sir Ken Robinson - Changing Education Paradigms](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDZFcDGpL4U)   * [The Young Turks coverage - Finland's Revolutionary Education Program](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlOfZL_J5fo&amp;feature=plcp&amp;context=C4ce591bVDvjVQa1PpcFPa90Qx73V4N8D_YxfuohaYPhwjOC9I5iY=)  * [More about Finland's educational system \(long article alert\)](http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/12/what-americans-keep-ignoring-about-finlands-school-success/250564/)  If those ideas got implemented, the educational system and future life would improve drastically for all ADHD people living in the given country.
