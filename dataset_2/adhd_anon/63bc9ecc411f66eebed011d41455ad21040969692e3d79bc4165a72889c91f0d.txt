I've been trying to self medicate for years, and treat anxiety that directly ties to my ADHD. I feel like I am finally understanding myself for the first time in years, and all the issues that I have seem to be based in the fact I was trying to cope with my ADHD and the loss of control I felt because of it.  Has anyone else had this experience?
