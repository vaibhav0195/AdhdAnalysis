I apologize in advance for any formatting issues or if this isn't the right place to post this):  I suspect that I may have some form of ADHD. (I think my mom's side of the family has a lot of undiagnosed mental issues). Whenever I look up information about ADHD I can check off many of the symptoms that I either remember from my childhood (I'm 27 now), or that I am currently still experiencing (bored easily, can't sit still, losing/misplacing/forgetting things, trouble paying attention to things I don't find interesting, easy to start tasks but hard to see them through to the end, etc.) I have a bit of a history of being let go from jobs in which the work is not something I'm really into, but that's not as much of an issue in my current job.  If diagnosed, I would not want to take medication, I would rather work on changing my lifestyle and/or habits to help with any problems. I  My question for r/ADHD/ is this: since I would not want to take any kind of medication, is there even a point to getting a diagnosis? What would the benefits of finding out at this point in my life? I already have many coping habits I've adopted over the years that have helped me with some of my issues. My worry is that it would end up being an expensive doctor visit and finding out whether or not I actually have ADHD would not have much impact on my day-to-day life at this point.  TLDR: 27F, not interested in medication, want to know what are the benefits of getting diagnosed as an adult or if it would be a waste of my time?   (edit: grammar)
