6925ce0d9fdf892e0755d220ddca0afe0bf1900fda08736aecfeb91596032629;;;I am planning to send a resume to a company asking if there are internship positions - is there anything I should be aware of?;;;I want to contact a company asking if they have any internship positions. Should I send my CV in my initial email?  Another thing is that I got really terrible grades due to undiagnosed ADHD and depression. I don't want to disclose this to anyone at this point but I don't know how to "explain" my grades if I ever get asked about it. Any tips for that?  For ADHDers who did something similar - do you have anything to share? Is there anything I should look out for to avoid screwing up?
