I want to give a shout-out to /r/Cinletharwi I was diagnosed ADHD-PI and was prescribed 30mg of vyvanse. I take my meds in the morning and about 2 hours later I notice a difference and it's awesome, I'm productive and focused... but it wears off about an hour or two later. Is this normal and I just need to wait to adjust or should I contact my psychiatrist?
