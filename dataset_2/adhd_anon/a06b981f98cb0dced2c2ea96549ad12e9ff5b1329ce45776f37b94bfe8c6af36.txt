Many thanks to you all for your posts, It helped me realize my own situation. I was put on 10mg Adderall XR just to start with. I understand this is your basic 'upper'. Should I be noticing changes immediately, or will it take a few days for the meds to kick in and begin their full effect? Much appreciated.
