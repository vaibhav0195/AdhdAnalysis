8dbc49e8977a2f5ec71b455b32be255f5ad55cdb2a95eba28adad8659f8ead6b;;;Math Struggle;;;I started having trouble in math when i was introduced to memorizing formulas and such. I've been on medication ever since grade school (I'm a junior in high school now) and from what I got from this sub and experience is that I need more time than most people with inserting numbers into formulas and everything beyond. Is it my math skills, adhd, or a helping of both?
