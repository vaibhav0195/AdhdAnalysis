I'm currently taking ritalin. something like 15-20mg a day. Sometimes i feel like i'm a bit more paranoid than usual. I am also a bit more agressive. And the worst of all is that i'm really less creative than when i don't take medication.  But the point is that all of thoses types of medications are psychostimulant, i can't believe that they don't hurt at all.  So, is anyone affraid of being mad one day ?  (my english is bad, and i don't feel bad)

I don't know if it is because i did'nt do sport last few days or if it is because of the effect of the ritalin.  I feel like if i was very angry, at the limit of rage (but i am not actually angry). This is disturbing.  Like if everything was shitty, like if all the things were more boring than a hell of boredome. Something like a lack of nicotin, but stronger.  I take methylphenidate since 3-4 years but i've never felt agressivity like this.  Therefore : bad food interaction ? Lack of sport ? My brain is melting ?

If i put 5mg (a half pill of [those](http://bin.ilsemedia.nl/m/m1dyimxw7rtt.jpg) ) in a coke bottle and drink it sip by sip all day long, it brings me some advantages.  - No ^^^fucking depression feeling ! - No side effect - A not so bad concentration even if the dosage is very low - My heart is not racing - Perfect for a little motivation improvement.  Just try it ! (pay attention to the foam, open ***slowly***)

It's not a so high psychostimulant but it's a nootropic too. Does someone ever tried it ?  Edit : I'm motivated to try it. Is there someone who know where i can afford some (for swtizerland) and possibly with a paypal account ?  Edit 2 : I ordered a box of 100 pills here : http://www.boostyourgrade.com/products-page/buy-piracetam/  Let's wait and see ?
