My previous relationship ended pretty badly (I'll spare you the details) about 7 months ago. Spent this time focusing on my career and studyings, and on shedding the weight I'd gained when I was dating.  I finally feel confident enough to get out of my shell. Had a few matches on Happn (it's popular where I live), one of them really clicked. We messaged for hours, talked like old friends. I got her number, asked her out without thinking twice, we had some light dinner and a wonderful chat. Dropped her off at home and we kissed goodbye.  So far, so good, right? Not for my brain, it ain't. Now I can't stop thinking about her. I keep obsessing over how long should I wait to text. If I should text or not. What I should write. Whether she's into me or not. How soon should I ask her on a second date. Where I should take her. Etc. Etc. Etc.  I went out with friends on Friday and I couldn't focus on the conversation because I was thinking about her. Forgot my meds yesterday and wasted the entire day on this. Went to sleep and _actually got depressed_ thinking things might not work out.  Thing is: When I don't like a girl, I can't bring myself to even talk to her. When I like a girl, it just explodes inside my brain. There's no middle ground. I feel the same kind of hyperfocus as a new activity, a new computer game, or anything that gives me a dopamine rush. And I also dread the day I'll lose interest.  Anyway, I'm trying to pull myself together and let things happen on their own pace for once. But it's hard, so hard. Even with my meds.  **TL;DR: Obsessing with girl after one date. Suspect it's ADHD-related.**
