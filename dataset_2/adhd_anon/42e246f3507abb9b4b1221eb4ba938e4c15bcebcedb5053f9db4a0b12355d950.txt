My son, 7 years old, was diagnosed with autism and ADHD.  They've been cycling through various medication, and we're now on 5mg of dexmethylpenidate once a day.  He took the pill fine for about a week, but now he appears to be vomiting after every other meal, and in the middle of the night.  Before we straight up blame the drug, however, I want to also point out this his siblings have also been vomiting a fair amount.  They are not on the drug.  My son has *always* had a sensitive stomach, feeding him zucchini is like giving him ipecac.  Makes him vomit once it touches his tongue.  It's pretty impressive actually, though there was some clean up involved while we tested this.  So, from community experience, has this level of vomiting been seen with dexmethylphenidate, or is it likely that the stomach bug that's going around is just being particularly mean on him?
