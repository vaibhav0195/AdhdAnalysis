8e13a478b46f211affdc944c31838700316b7a55f82517af92fdc58cda3bc285;;;Makes me mad seeing posts people asking "just got a tablet of adderall what to expect..." or "can I take adderall two days in a row got it from a friend?" And people answering...;;;Now that I have been diagnosed and taking medication daily for about a year (definitely don't feel the euphoria anymore just helps me focus and actually treats my ADD) I get so annoyed with these posts. People that take it that don't have ADD don't understand how unfair it is to take it for an "added boost during finals week". Like please, you're making it harder for the rest for us.
