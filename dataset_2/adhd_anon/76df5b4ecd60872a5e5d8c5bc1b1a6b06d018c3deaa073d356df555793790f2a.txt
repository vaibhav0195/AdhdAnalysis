Not really sure if I'm at the right dosage.;;;So yeah, I was diagnosed with ADHD-C a few days ago and I'm only on my second day of Adderall 10mg (3 times a day every 4 hours).  I'm not really interested in getting my dose up to the point that I have some sort of academic advantage over other students. I'd also prefer to not underdose and stay distracted. I'd really just like to get to the closest point of normality as possible.  In terms of distractions, I've found that I don't really feel the distractions I used to feel anymore. I am now able to work at home in silence, neither of which was possible beforehand. I still check Facebook or my email or even just read an article or two online every now and then, but I feel a compelling need to return to my work after about 5 minutes. And while I can now work in silence, I don't prefer it.  When I watch TV on meds I actually WATCH the TV, which is crazy, because I never realized before that my eyes were constantly darting around the room when I watched TV off meds. I can also watch TV without multitasking (on the internet, on my phone, playing games, listening to music).  My procrastination seems to have dialed itself down; I actually completed two college apps today in full, one of them a full month before its due date. A bit of it's still there, but it's easy to control.  My main question is, is this how I'm supposed to feel? Part of me says that because there are still distractions and procrastination I should try a higher dose, but another part of me says that I'm a little bit TOO focused compared to the rest of the population, almost like I'm cheating. Any advice?
