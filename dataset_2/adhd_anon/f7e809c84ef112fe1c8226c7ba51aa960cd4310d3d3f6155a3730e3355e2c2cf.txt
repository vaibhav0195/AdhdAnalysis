Would you rather be unmedicated and cope or medicated.;;;I am a 25 yr old female and was diagnosed with ADHD when I was very little. My parents decided to teach me how to handle it without medications. Let me just say I think it's a big debate on what is better, medications or learning how to handle it. I have never even tried ADHD meds just to see what happened. So homies!! What are your thoughts? I am to the point that I cope very very well so I'm happy to never try them, but if you could go back in time, what would you do? Medicate or learn to handle it?
