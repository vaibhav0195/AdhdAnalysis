d5ef74ad14f7ab44cbddfde84bacf811234e78473e5a9cd2044c98e98cb86a74;;;Co-existing condition: Sensory processing disorder?;;;I was diagnosed with ADHD by a specialist 9 or 10 years ago and have been receiving medication treatment ever since (Adderall, Intuniv, and Celexa). However, I've had some other symptoms which don't seem to align with ADHD and I wanted to see if any other ADHD'ers experience them as well. They are a little difficult to describe but I'll try my best - to summarize, it's extremely difficult for me to ignore unpleasant physical sensations and I remember going through this since I was a kid. For example:   * Clothes tags drive me crazy! They feel scratchy against my skin, I frequently re-adjust my shirt to try and remove the sensation. I first remember this occurring when i was 9 or 10, I couldn't sleep all night once because the tag on my underwear suddenly felt so uncomfortable.  * Physical exertion is extremely unpleasant. I feel that I have a decent level of fitness, I can walk for relatively long distances without issue and lift a decent amount of weight. However, actually lifting the weight or doing things like push-ups or running is extremely uncomfortable. I don't get tired, it's like all of the unpleasant body feedback (e.g. burning muscles) jump to the front of my mind and can't be ignored. What's interesting is that this feeling occasionally disappears and some medications help reduce the symptoms (e.g. Trileptal, Abilify)  * I love being cold and hate being hot. Being hot drives me crazy, I think because I start to sweat and I can't ignore how uncomfortable the feeling of wet sweat in my clothes makes me feel.   My psychiatrist said that this sounds like something called Sensory Processing Disorder (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_processing_disorder) which commonly co-exists with ADHD. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? If so, what have you done to treat it?
