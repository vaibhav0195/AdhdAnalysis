It's been forcibly brought to my attention that I am an utter asshole while using my prescribed dose of adderall (10mg IR.) In particular:  - Less patient with errors in others - Quicker to more intense anger - More likely to talk over someone else - More likely to have entire conversations with myself with another person in the conversation, bringing up and addressing points and predicted counterarguments without allowing them to interject  For the time being, I'm going to try restricting caffeine while also using adderall, and attempt better self-control, ie using the increased energy to examine a proposed sentence before actually speaking it. Does anyone else have ideas or techniques that have worked for them? Thanks in advance.  Edit: my diagnosis is -PI; I've brought up the possibility of SCT but neither doc nor pdoc are interested in anything not in the current DSM.
