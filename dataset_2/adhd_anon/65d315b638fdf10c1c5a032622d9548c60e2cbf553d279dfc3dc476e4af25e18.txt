I'm not diagnosed, but I'm quite suspicious that, at 30 years old, this condition seems to have been a part of my life for as long as I can remember.   If I'm cleaning the kitchen, or writing, I find that it's much easier to concentrate with music going in my ears, blocking out other sounds. The band The Offspring is an ideal choice because their songs are very loud and constant. The rule for the children is to not talk to me when I have my headphones in. Can anyone else relate to this?
