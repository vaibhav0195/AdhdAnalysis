Do I need higher dose or med not for me?;;;Hi there,  I was diagnosed with ADHD-PI last year and took my first Concerta 18mg this morning at 9.30am (breakfast was protein bar and some coffee around 8).   Pretty soon, I started noticing side effects: muscle-tension in upper back, increased urinary frequency, a feeling of disconnect from the world, decreased ability to interact with others, utter lack of motivation, a depressed mood, and most surprisingly, an even lower attention span.   I made more mistakes at work today than I've been making lately when I was off meds!   This is the third ADHD medication I've been on, second stimulant. Vyvanse was horrible for me (too much anxiety and nervousness without therapeutic effects), Strattera didn't really work. I've taken Adderall once without prescription and it was a miracle worker (however, I didn't want to tell my psychiatrist this as I don't want her to think I'm peddling for drugs). When she put me on Concerta she said the dose might be low, so I'm wondering if maybe I just need to up the dosage, or if this medication is not for me.  Has anyone suffered any ill-effects like I am today while on Concerta? Should I ask for a higher dose? If so, when? My next appointment is in 3 weeks.  Edit: I'm 30 F, 5'1, 100 lbs.  Thanks, all!  TL;DR: First day on Concerta 18mg but not feeling therapeutic effects, only side effects. Do I need higher dose or switch to new meds?
