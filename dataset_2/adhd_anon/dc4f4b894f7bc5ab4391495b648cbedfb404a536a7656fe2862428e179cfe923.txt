Video games have always been one of the only things I could actually pay attention towards. I often hyperfocus and forget to move for 6 hours while immersed in a game. I am sure there are a lot of ADHD gamers out there, so I figured might as well attempt to expand the community over there.  I play a lot of TF2, but own over 100 games (and played maybe 13 of them) due to impulsive Steam sales purchases.   My steam name is **ADHD Santa** (please add me!)  Group name: **[/r/ADHD](/r/ADHD) Hyperfocused gamers**  URL: **[http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ADHDreddit](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ADHDreddit)**  The group is private so I will have to invite you. Either message me on steam, pm on reddit, or leave your steam name in comments if interested.  I figured it would be a fun place to play games together, chat about our ADHD, and maybe keep each other accountable so we don't lose 14 hours by playing Skyrim on a weekend.   Can't wait to meet/play with some of you!!!

[Week 3];;;Even though Wednesday has passed I encourage you to share your wins throughout the week. **You are not late!** This is a great awareness builder!  ***  **Welcome to the 3rd edition of Win Wednesday!** It's the moment that 3 of you have been waiting for! We had 12 participants the first week, 24 last week...**can we keep doubling that today**?  At the beginning of each ADHD support group, I like to have everyone share their "win" for the month. What surprised me was **most people couldn't even come up with ONE positive thing they accomplished the past 30 days**! *If I asked for the bad things that happened each person probably could name 20 before pausing...*  So here if your chance to **brag about something small you got done.** We ALL had wins both big and small. *You basically get free comment karma as well!* *** Some examples from last week  * Started taking ADHD medication x2 * Called doctor to set up an appointment x4 * Working out and eating a healthy diet * Got to work...on time!  *** By sharing our wins every Wednesday...**I hope you will start to be on the lookout for the positive things you do each week. You will start to gain awareness and see that everything isn't all bad!** *This MIGHT even become a routine as you excitedly log on every Wednesday night to share.*  I understand it might be hard (initially) to think of something. **If you cannot think of a "Win" then I invite you to name 1 (or more) things you are grateful for.**  *** My wins:  * Celebrated my 29th birthday with close friends * Spent 15 minutes starting my taxes * Got to sleep before midnight every day (except bday yesterday) * Spent a LOT of time answering comments in [/r/ADHD](/r/ADHD)  * Went for 2 runs this week
dc4f4b894f7bc5ab4391495b648cbedfb404a536a7656fe2862428e179cfe923;;;[Kick-Start Sunday] Go for the EASY SUCCESS this week with gentle accountability from /r/ADHD!;;;~~To Accomplish Tuesday...Momentum Monday...~~  Kick-Start Sunday is where /r/adhd can come to share the goals, tasks, or habits we all want to accomplish this week. By sharing here you will be held accountable (which is a good thing!) and we can help check in with you...**helping YOU get things done.**  *I highly recommend reading this longer post. If you want to skip it and just list what you want to do this week...go ahead. But, if you want a better chance to succeed and are willing to put a little extra initial effort in now...continue reading...*  *** ## Suggested ways you can participate:  * **Most important task** - Share one (or a couple) **HIGH-PRIORITY** tasks that you really would like to finally finish. Ex. Set a doctors appointment, finish assignment, clean the kitchen...whatever YOU think is most important.  * **Make a list** - Post a list of all the things you want to accomplish this week. (I highly recommend identifying the top 3 priorities.)  * **Feed your soul** - Sometimes by relaxing and having fun we have more energy to get more done. **List a couple FUN items to make your list more exciting.**  **Need/Want to copy last week's list *verbatim*?  Absolutely DO SO!**  *Those might be your keystone habits. Once you start doing those regularly you are able to do more. soon they will be automatic and you can put your focus elsewhere.*  *** By sharing your goal semi-publicly we can keep each other and **accountable**...and **celebrate in our small successes!**  By getting one small task done it creates **momentum**, **trust** in yourself, **confidence**, and you will feel like doing more.  ♥ ♥ ♥ **Never posted on Reddit before?** I welcome you to make this your first! ☺☺☺  *** ## Suggested Guidelines  * **Prioritize your list** One thing you want to get done (or start). What is the most important thing for you? (If making a list works best for you feel free to do that too!)  * **When would you like to finish OR start it by?** By committing to a date/time, we can check on your progress.  * **Edit your comment when done** - Come back and edit your comment when you have finished your goal. We can celebrate that (and then people won't check on you).  * **Small start** - Share what SMALL (under 10 minutes) commitment you want to make towards starting your goal. I found when my clients didn’t reach their goals 90% of the time they never started...this will help you break through the initial barrier.  *** ## Tips  * Your tasks/goals should ideally be S.M.A.R.T goals: **Specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound** * **Measurable** - Make sure you can be able to say YES I DID THIS. **Study enough** is not measurable. Study 2 hours is.  * **Break it down** - Instead of saying clean my room...it might help to say. Clean room for 10 minutes or pick up trash in room. * **Write it down elsewhere** - Sticky note by computer. Google calendar. Agenda. Write it down so you don't forget. Our working memories are flaky... * **Start small...build up slowly** - We want to build on small successes so committing to cleaning your entire house might be a bit too much to handle. Pick a room instead. **Want to study for 2 hours a day?** Commit to studying 30 minutes to make it easier on you.   *** ## Examples from previous weeks:  * Unload the dishwasher * Study X hours a day (though I suggest starting small with minutes) * Make an appointment with doctor * Clean car (get trash out) * **Start** *[something]*. Spend 5 minutes on writing my paper. *  many more....  *** ## *It’s now easier to respond!  Just copy/paste the below into your comment.*  	## Daily Habit / Procrastinated Project / Soul-Feeding 	* **What?** - 	* **How much time?** - 	* **When?** - 	* **Potential Obstacles?** - 	* **Check in on me? When?** - 	* **Small Start** - 	* **Reward** - 	* **Something fun you want to do this week** - 	* **Daily Habit** -  *** I just came up with a new option that might work better for some people. Listing the things they want to do each day. So for those people here is a template.      ## **Monday** -      * Item     ## **Tuesday**-      ## **Wednesday**-      ## **Thursday**-      ## **Friday**-      ## **Saturday**-      ## **Sunday**-      *** **Hopefully most of you can also participate in Win Wednesday**. We had an increase in participation last week and I am hoping to continue to build on that this week. **Celebrating/acknowledging your wins is just as important as actually getting stuff done.**  If you have any other suggestions for weekly threads or improvements to the OP text OR just a suggestion on how we can make /r/adhd better then message me!  ***   **TLDR: Share what you want to accomplish this week and how you will do it. Having people check on you via Reddit is extremely helpful!**

AMAA ;;;Hello /r/adhd! I felt it might be time for me to do an AMA and share a bit about myself with the community. I have been an active moderator, contributor, and commenter for the past few months (thanks to hyperfocus). I have seen the community grow from 1000 to 3500 over that time. I am the one mostly responsible for the changes in CSS and the weekly threads.  Ask me about  * Yoga and meditation * Support groups * Being a moderator here * Anything ADHD * ADHD Coaching * Anything else  *** ##Who I am  Lets see. You all have ADHD so maybe bullets might help me explain this easier  * **Basic Info**: Male. 29. Red hair. Married.  * **Personal ADHD History**: Went in to be diagnosed with depression back in 2000 at age 17. Got diagnosed with depression and ADHD-PI (surprised me. Didn't know much about ADHD). Only person in family with ADHD.  * **Medication history** - Ritalin (1 yr) Concerta (1 yr) Adderall XR+IR (10 yr) Vyvanse (2 months) * **Professional ADHD Experience**- I have been an ADHD coach for over a year with 18 clients ranging from ages 12-55. I run 2 monthly support groups (an adults with ADHD and parents of ADHD children). Volunteer at a local non-profit [ADD Resources](http://www.addresources.org). *** ##ADHD Coaching For general questions about ADHD coaching I highly recommend you view what [Nancy Ratey says about ADHD coaching](http://www.nancyratey.com/adhdcoaching). If you have questions about my specific coaching (or more after reading that page) please ask!  * Weekly coaching sessions are typically done over the phone or Skype lasting 30-60 minutes. * During the coaching session I ask you for your wins, you share the important parts of your week, and how progress went on your goal. * I help you notice the positive parts of your week and what you can learn from your completion (or procrastination) of your goal. We plan for the next week. * Coaching typically will cost over $200 per month. * Throughout the week I will do whatever I need to do to support you. If you want me to email you daily...great! Text reminders?   An ADHD coach understands the ADHD mind and places an emphasis on time management/awareness, setting various reminders, and helping the client discover a system which works for them.   As a coach I believe the client is fully capable and has all the answers. I just ask questions and empower them to discover the power inside themselves. Once again I can go for a while about this but it will be easier for me to answer more specific questions. *** ##Influence of yoga and meditation  **Meditation enabled me to discover the present moment and see things in a clear way (not filtering my experience through my thoughts).** I started meditating on the breath just for the concentration benefits, but soon noticed an explosion in awareness. I practice mindfulness meditation, walking meditation, metta (loving-kindness) meditation, and many other forms. Sometimes guided. This has really helped me notice my thoughts and judgements, see them as an observer, and see how random our minds really are. (I could write for hours on meditation alone so I will just answer specific questions).  **Yoga has allowed me to get in touch (and forge a stronger connection) with my body and mind.** I started yoga initially just for the stretching aspects. My knees hurt so bad I was about to get MRI's done on both and my lower back had a lot of pain. After doing yoga for 2 months my knee and back pain has disappeared. I used to live from the neck up (in my thoughts). I had little awareness of my body and often hurt myself by pushing too hard exercising. Yoga helps bring the body and mind together and work in a more fluid way. I now want to become a yoga teacher and teach it to groups of people afflicted with Aspergers, ADHD, or other similar disorders. ***  ##My blog ~~I haven't blogged since I discovered /r/add.~~ HA! I just wrote an impromtu blog post to break the streak. Didn't want to point you all to an apparently abandoned blog...I will hopefully start posting there more often. I already wrote an article written on procrastination (6 months ago on the importance of just starting/part 2 will be about finishing) but I haven't written the last couple sentences.   I am not much for self-promotion but here is a link to my blog and some other ways you can follow/keep in touch. *** ##Follow/Connect with me Blog: [The Scattered Mind](http://www.thescatteredmind.com)  Twitter: [@brandonkochpc](http://www.twitter.com/brandonkochpc)  Google+: [My google plus page](https://plus.google.com/113650690829717847863/posts) *I plan to start being much more active here on the topic of ADHD (and life).*  ***  EDIT: Adding some info on ADHD to OP.  ##Possible new symptoms of ADHD specific for adults  * Some ADHD adults work hard at being organized but have little to show for results. This can lead to feelings of hopelessness and avoidance of organizing. * They don't live up to potential. Others may assume they could do better if only they cared more or tried harder. * They frequently miss turns and exits when driving, especially when going down familiar roads. * They have poor time management and/or procrastination which causes big problems at work and home. * They hyperfocus on an enjoyable activity to the point where other activities are forgotten or ignored for longer stretches of time than planned. * They have a tendency to miss pieces of conversation or be briefly tuned out. This may or may not be visible to others. * Is often easily distracted by extraneous stimuli or irrelevant thoughts.  * Often makes decisions impulsively. * Often has difficulty stopping his or her activities or behavior when he or she should do so. * Often starts a project or task without reading or listening to directions carefully. * Often shows poor follow-through on promises or commitments he makes to others. * Often has trouble doing things in their proper order or sequence. * Often has difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play activities.  * Often has difficulty organizing tasks and activities. * Often more likely to drive a motor vehicle much faster than others.

Information inside...;;;Too late!  *** ##### If you want to receive invitations for all the future hangouts be sure to circle the /r/ADHD page (below). I will circle you back. Bam you will get the invitation.  *** ## Hangout over! Thanks people for stopping by. We had about 6 people. I will be doing all kinds of different times (and give more advance notice) so everyone from around the world will have a chance. This was my first hangout so I definitely learned some things!   ***  * [/r/ADHD Google+ Page](https://plus.google.com/b/109882427902210563726/109882427902210563726/posts) * [The actual hangout event on Google+](https://plus.google.com/b/109882427902210563726/events/c3f70rhm4uh8an1lhk4kpoval1o/109882427902210563726) * [My personal Google+ page](https://plus.google.com/113650690829717847863/posts) - I plan to be posting a lot more on ADHD in the near future here.  I have been floating this idea around for MONTHS now. When I try to plan it...**the week flies by** (you all know exactly how that goes) and I don't want to do it Friday/Sat/Sun. So, after 3 hours of sleep and a full day of volunteering....why not! (I really love to volunteer for the ADD non-profit and it gives me energy just like posting in /r/ADHD)  ***  ######This will last from 4-5 PDT. If you miss out (but still circle /r/ADHD) then I will notify you of the next one. Would like to have these weekly/monthly depending on how things go. *** #####Steps  0. Join Google+ if you haven't (I think everyone with ADHD should use Google mail/calendar...you all do...right?) 1. Put /r/ADHD in your circles (link at top) 2. Sign up for event (might give you a handy reminder) 3. Plug in webcam. Test microphone. 4. Get presentable and clean up the area which will be shown in the webcam (if you want) 5. **Make a name tag** - Recommended. Write your reddit name on a piece of paper or not if you don't want the accounts linked. 6. Set a reminder alarm (I would imagine google will send an email too...this is why I am testing this) 7. Come say hi!  ***  Possible things we could do:  * Say hi and share our **wins ** in person-ish * Each commit to cleaning a small area (in the meantime you can clean your desk/background) * Show our ADHD systems we have around the house (or half-systems if you all are like me) * Watch amazing Russell Barkley videos and discuss. Share other cool ADHD-related Youtube videos (no cats please) * AMA about myself or ADHD (I am an ADHD coach, support group leader, and I do daily meditation/yoga) * Share different websites/apps/timers/techniques that help us focus * I could lead a group meditation... * Go off on a **completely different tangent** and leave the hangout an hour later wondering WTF happened to the last hour of our life...  ***  So hookup your webcam. Test your microphone...and let's do this!  ***You could join just using a microphone I believe*  ***  I am heading back to volunteer (need to mail off a bunch of books for people), then I will rest/meditate, and be back to give you all my complete focus (which might be not after the 3 hours of sleep I got).

Breathe...and center ourselves...This week: Metta (lovingkindness) phrases;;;Namaste!  Welcome to the first ever mindful Monday. If people like this...I will continue it.  This will be a simple post each week. A thought, meditation instructions, quote. All you need to do is breathe...read...and relax....  Metta is a meditation practice where one calms their mind and radiates love towards themselves, a loved one, a neutral person, and an enemy.  I just finished sitting and practiced the following phrases towards all 7000 members of /r/ADHD:  *May you be happy.*  *May you be safe.*  *May you be healthy.*  *May your body and mind be at ease.*  *May you be focused.*  *May you love yourself completely. Without judgement.*  Repeat x5  ***   &gt;By practicing Metta meditation, we are creating a skillful habit of mind, one which allows us to soften into the deeper experiences of our lives, the chances to connect with all that is around and within us.... to live more fully. It allows a spaciousness to develop in the mind allowing us to be less reactive, less stressed out, more calm in the face of challenges, losses, injustices.  &gt;At the same time, we are breaking the unskillful habit of mind associated with greed: possessiveness, fear, separateness, hatred. We are moving away from the habits of anger and aversion, rage, despair, disappointment.  Source: http://www.bemindful.org/metta.htm  ***  When I started **I was surprised to discover how hard it was to feel this love towards myself** (this is often the case). By practicing again and again, I finally started to break the barriers. Took months. But I finally broke through. You can too.  I suggest doing this via a guided meditation to help you remember the phrases (initially I forgot them often) and keep your mind on track.  * Learn more about metta meditation (audio + pdf) http://audiodharma.org/series/1/talk/1728/  * Guided metta meditation (27 minutes) [http://media.audiodharma.org/mp3files/2001-09-06_GilFronsdal_GuidedMetta.mp3](http://media.audiodharma.org/mp3files/2001-09-06_GilFronsdal_GuidedMetta.mp3)  ***  Let me know how it went.

He also wrote the book "More attention Less Deficit" AND has expressed interest in doing an /r/ADHD AMA soon! ;;;I work for ADD Resources now (previously a volunteer) and have taken the initiative to start our twice-monthly webinars with ADHD experts for our members and the public.  It would be very cool to get a few extra listens from all my friends here at /r/ADHD!   ***  ###Description:  ADHD is a neurological condition, but **neurology often drives psychology**. This is especially true for many adults with ADHD who spent **most of their lives undiagnosed** and therefore untreated. As a result of this lifetime of additional struggles, they tend to develop certain mindsets and ways of relating to others.  While this may have played a protective role before the person is diagnosed, **finally getting appropriate treatment can be a real game changer in terms of what they are capable of.**  Unfortunately, some of those older mindsets may still persist and undermine their progress in getting their lives in order. **We will discuss how three of these common mindsets develop and how to shift to a more positive and productive mindset.**  ***  *After we get diagnosed and take medication, eventually discover that our negative thinking is holding us back. Ari will help you recognize this thinking and show you how you can start thinking more positively!*  ***  **[Find out what time this is for you](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=ADD+Resources+Ari+Tuckman+Webinar&amp;iso=20121127T18&amp;p1=391&amp;ah=1)**  Sorry Europe looks like this will be the VERY early morning, but you will be able to listen to the recording afterwards.

If there is a particular topic or speaker you want to see, let me know and I will see what I can do! **I hope to get most of the experts to also do an AMA in /r/ADHD.**  ***  **I will probably start a thread this week announcing the upcoming AMA and collect questions for a week.

We all have to start somewhere.;;;##### WIN WEDNESDAY!!!  *Just wanted to remind people to **upvote this post**. Recently, our weekly threads get pushed off the page pretty quick. More upvotes = more wins = more people getting inspired (it is a cycle).*  #####Science behind Win Wednesday  * Scientists think our brain has a built in negativity bias by reacting more to a negative stimulus. In effect, our brain is like velcro for negative experiences and teflon for positive ones.   * Painful experiences are usually more memorable than positive ones and lasting, good relationships typically need at least a 5:1 ratio of positive to negative interactions.  * By **tilting toward the good** you are leveling the playing field.    * **Instead of positive experiences washing through you like water through a sieve, they’ll collect in the implicit memory deep down in your brain.**  * **Soak in the positive events in your life**   * By pausing and holding that positive feeling for a BIT longer, you are slowly changing the wiring of your brain.   *I have much more information on the neuroscience of recognizing the good, let me know if you want more info.*  ***  Win Wednesday is a chance to focus on our accomplishments for the week. Doing this enough WILL change your brain for the better!  ###***The Sacred Creed of Win Wednesday:***  * **Each and every one of us have victories every week, be they great or small. But in Win Wednesday, *no* victory is truly a small one.**  * **Whatever "level" you happen to be at, progress is *always* a cause for celebration!**   * **Please don’t discount anything you have done. The whole point is to share how YOU won, and did not let your ADHD win!** Check out the examples to see what we mean!**  *** * The point of Win Wednesday is equally **to share our wins AND celebrate the wins of others!** If you do or don’t have a win, feel free to give positive support and cheer to those posting (not just upvoting)!  * **Each week Win Wednesday gets hundreds of views, but only 5 people replying to the winning comments...let’s change things this week!** Just saying “good job” means a lot to someone who has been struggling!  ***  ##### PHENOMENAL EXAMPLES FROM PAST WEEKS: (updated 2/27)  * All the dishes are washed, dried and put away, and have stayed that way since Saturday * I asked a girl on a date and she said yes. * I cleaned out my fridge and organized leftovers! * Agreed to participate in a very challenging dance performance that I very likely would have declined in the past. * have kept impulse buys to a minimum * Learned how to make bullet points on Reddit:p * No heroin or sleeping pills since thursday I think. Planning on going until forever * Made a wedding decision about the officiant (finally)  ##### We love you, /r/adhd!

I am stoked to be back to /r/ADHD after taking a break for a month (missed you guys). Hopefully we can get some new blood posting today!*  -computerpsych

I'll make sure everyone gets an answer. Ask away!;;;#### Another Friday is upon us! Time to ask and answer some questions!  ***   ## The main purpose of this thread:  * Provide a place for people to **ask simple questions** which may not need a dedicated post.   * Give people **new to the  /r/ADHD community (and there are thousands of you)** a chance to say hello and share a bit about their strengths, struggles, and dreams.   * Reduce the amount of threads asking a simple question in /r/ADHD  ***   **This is the place for questions like:**  * How do I force myself to eat despite a depressed appetite?   * What was your experience on [medication]?   * I took Adderall for the first time yesterday, and now I have tentacles growing out of my back!   * Did you tell your friends, coworkers, family about your ADHD?    * Do you feel like your ADHD makes you special?   * How do I talk to [doctor, psych, parents] about getting an ADHD diagnosis?   * What smells like red?    **We will attempt to answer every question in this thread (within a week). Hopefully others will help us out...but we won’t leave you hangin'!**  ***   Another method of communicating is to [](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=/r/ADHD).  ## The idea is to consolidate all of these kinds of questions into a single place that is more easily searched.  As we migrate from my temporary wiki to the new reddit wiki, these threads will be helpful.

Fuck yeah! * I paid off my credit card. * FINALLY hung my custom mirror that's been gathering dust in the hallway for about a month. * Finished some more group projects ahead of schedule so I'm not the one everyone is waiting on. * Today I realized I was the common denominator in many bad relationships that are most important to me. I told my loved ones this and started a new chapter today. Feels good. * So far, I've managed to make $90 doing different repair work. This is a pretty big deal for me, my ADHD is bad enough that I'm on disability * I had my highest GPA ever.[1]   with my most difficult courses ever * Got my blood work done, got stuff needed for other medical testing, and I set up an appointment with a woman's counselor to add to the therapy I am already doing * I'm late but I finally stopped talking about auditioning for a play at my local theater and did it!  * I got engaged. :) * I think I have finally identified a definable improvement of my meds. * Many many more!  ##### We love you, /r/adhd!
