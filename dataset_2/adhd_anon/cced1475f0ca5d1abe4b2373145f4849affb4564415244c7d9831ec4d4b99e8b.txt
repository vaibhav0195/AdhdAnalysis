I went off of my meds 3 months ago. Everythingg was great, but my father (and also boss) hated me being on adderall, so I tried to stop. I had everything, the girl of my dreams (seriously, if anyone else has found the ONE person for them they get this), a great job, but i still relapsed to self destructive behaviour. I began using pills again (opiates) and when i was sick did things im terribly ashamed of and used her things as collaterall, the whole nine yards. And I don't know why. i knew it would hurt her.  this all exploded this weekend. She's been gone since Thursday and I cry myself to sleep each night I dont see her, but I'm giving her space. My family wants me to go to a 6 month rehab and I know it wont help. Does anyone else struggle with this? how do you handle it?
