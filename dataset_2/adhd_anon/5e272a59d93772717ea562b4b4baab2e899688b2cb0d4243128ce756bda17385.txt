The gist is that self-imposed limitations are useful in exploring different avenues of thought, and can also be fun! (I'm NOT saying that ADHD is useful or fun, I'm also NOT saying it can't be useful or fun either, decide for yourself how you view the condition.)   If we imagine a chess board, with all our pieces, and there are no limitations to what any of the pieces can do, chess suddenly becomes quite uninteresting. When you introduce limitations on what pieces can do and when, i.e. 'Rules', only then do we have a decent board game.  Before my diagnosis it was obvious to me that I was losing every 'game' I played. I tried many different strategies but would always lose in the end. This made me very depressed and anxious. When someone suffers from a neurological condition it's very difficult for them to have insight into said condition, they just don't know the rules of their own game.   After my diagnosis I realised that my rules were different from most people's because my brain is different. Looking at my behaviour, past and present, through the framework of 'ADHD' has allowed me to slowly begin to understand the rules, I believe my understanding will only grow as I'm now looking in the right places. So armed, I feel much better about the prospect of tackling my problems, because I'm confident I'll eventually find a way to 'win'.  CHECKMATE ADHD!!!
