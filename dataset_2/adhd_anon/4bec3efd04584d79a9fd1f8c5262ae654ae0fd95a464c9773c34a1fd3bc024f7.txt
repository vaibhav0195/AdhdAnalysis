The psychologist diagnosed me after a series of lengthy tests, then the two counsellors I spoke to agreed with her. So I went to see my family doctor to get a prescription, and she said she thinks I have it but wants to "confirm" and get a 5th opinion... now I am on a wait list to see a psychiatrist who isn't available for 3 months.   I am so frustrated. What should I do? My doctor said if the wait is long, I can go back to her and trial meds. Should I?
