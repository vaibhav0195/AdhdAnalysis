I have a weird case in that I have found a few drugs that work for me, but the side effects greatly overwhelm any good the drugs have.  I have stuck it out for weeks hoping side effects would go away and they never would.  I metabolize drugs very slowly. A 2.5mg dose of Adderall 2 times a day is more than enough for me. However, even at this ridiculously low dose, I am too dizzy to function, and get no sleep. I can't drive, I can't go running, I can not do any type of workout what so ever (among other more tolerable side effects).  Imipramine and it's family of drugs (non stimulant) also work for me, but hilariously, have the exact same effects of stimulants on me. Can't sleep, too dizzy to do anything, dry mouth, headaches, etc...  I have been diagnosed and tried to help 5 separate times in my life by 5 separate doctors, and every time I hit the side effect brick wall and am given no other drug free options.  The two things I am trying to really figure out are sleep and focus. Good sleep I am sure will help with focus, but after a sleep and narcolepsy study, I have been told I sleep "poorly" and there is no diagnosable medical reason for it...  Ugh.
