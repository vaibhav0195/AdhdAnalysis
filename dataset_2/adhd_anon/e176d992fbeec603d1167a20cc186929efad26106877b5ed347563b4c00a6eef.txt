e176d992fbeec603d1167a20cc186929efad26106877b5ed347563b4c00a6eef;;;Have anyone ever experimented with meditation?;;;Recently diagnosed with inattentive ADHD, prescribed twice daily 20mg adderal. At the risk of sounding like a complete tree-hugger, has anyone ever experimented with daily meditation? I've read that you can train yourself to focus more easily, but I'm wondering if anyone has personal experience?  Also, just wanted to throw out there that this subreddit has literally been more helpful and informative for me than any other source, including my psychiatrist. Thanks for helping make this whole thing a litte easier. Just shelling out some feel good.
