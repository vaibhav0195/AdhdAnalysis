Since I am starting graduate school in the fall, I decided to start taking stimulant medication after about five years of being medication-free. I see a psychiatrist who prescribes my medication and a psychologist who is helping me work through some issues related to depression. Recently I told my psychologist that I feel that I am able to stay alert and focused at work, but when I get home, because of a mixture of anxiety and depression, I am unable to focus on schoolwork and it is hurting my grades. She told me she doesn't think that my medication is working. This surprised me because this has always been my experience. I have a lot of issues with procrastination, self-motivation, and often have difficulties focusing when I am overwhelmed by the task at hand. Is medication really meant to combat this behavior? Because I always thought that was something I had to muscle through.   Any advice or first-hand experience would be helpful. All of the information online about it at present seems to be weird, fluffy bullshit geared toward stressed out parents.
