I've been lifting weights for over two years now on and off. But I'm tired of lifting weights and working out, and I feel like I'm going no where. My main factors are:  1. I don't see results fast (no carrot no work - just like no reward from doing homework). 2. I have trouble keeping the routine and the longest I've been on a workout plan/routine was 3 weeks. Else it lasts 1-2 weeks before I change something in the program or change to new program.  3. I had a bad appetite prior to getting diagnosed and getting meds, but now it's not nearly there at all. Before meds I used to eat because it was work and without eating the required calories I would have wasted a workout or another day of not growing/getting rested, which would halter me even more.     What I've tried:  - Simple and really detailed workout plans &amp; diet plans.  - Atleast 15 novice &amp; intermediate programs (had most succes with BigButBoring and RPT)  - I've calculated my TDEE almost twice a week to see if something wasn't calculated right. I've tried lean gains and 24 hour fasting and I've tried dirty bulking which only made me fatter.   So my question is: How do I keep myself on a program for more than 1-2 weeks and finally start to gain some muscle/lose some fat? I've tried so many things and I know I gotta track my progress over weekly gains instead of daily, and I can do that but I start losing motivation after a week or two of doing that.
