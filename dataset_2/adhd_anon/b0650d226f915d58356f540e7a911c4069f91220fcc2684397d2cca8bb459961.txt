b0650d226f915d58356f540e7a911c4069f91220fcc2684397d2cca8bb459961;;;A question for those who were diagnosed with ADHD as adults;;;I am wondering at what point you realised that something was amiss and what changed after you were diagnosed, notable improvements academically, socially or in other personal ways ? I am pretty certain this question has been covered in some way or other in this forum but I am new here. Also if there is anyone UK based what was the process you went through towards getting diagnosed, and being provided with treatment?  **Edit: Thanks for all the responses guys, it has been interesting reading all your answers and the changes that have happened since I will, certainly look into it as it seems that I relate to most of you in one way or another**
