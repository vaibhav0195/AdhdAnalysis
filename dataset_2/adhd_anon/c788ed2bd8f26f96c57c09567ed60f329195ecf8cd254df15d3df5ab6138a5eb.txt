c788ed2bd8f26f96c57c09567ed60f329195ecf8cd254df15d3df5ab6138a5eb;;;Doctors thinks I have anxiety/depression but I think it's ADHD;;;So recently after seeing a general doctor several times, he diagnosed me with depression and/or anxiety. My initial reason to see the doctor was for ADHD, and in my observations, it seems all my symptoms mimic ADHD (inattentive type). I have done numerous online surveys, yet the doctor immediately (within a couple of minutes) ruled out ADHD. I'm currently on 5 mg of cipralex, for anxiety, depression and possibly OCD.  I think the real problem is inattentive ADHD, how can I make sure I'm not misdiagnosed?  Thanks in advance.
