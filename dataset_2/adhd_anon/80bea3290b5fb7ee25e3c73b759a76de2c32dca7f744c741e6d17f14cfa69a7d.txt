I can read the individual words quickly but get jumbled up in the text when there are multipe words in secession (lists, sentences, etc).   I used to struggle with this problem especially when reviewing notes and studying. It would take me hours to work my way through a chapter in my textbook, and I would still struggle with the work.  I found that if I underline what I am reading as I read it, it sticks in my memory a lot better. It also helps me keep where I am on the page.    I started writing drafts and taking notes by hand which has helped improve my handwriting. I'm proud to say that my handwriting is now legable enough for most people to read it.  I'm still identifying little things about myself that need a little improvement.  Up until this point in life I didn't realize that I was missing out on so much happening right in front of me, and so much still slips through the cracks. I hope the focus I'm applying to my studies and my life doesn't subside like another half completed project.  The fact that I see so many of my symptoms in this sub amazes me to no end, even if it should be common sense that a group of people with the same diagnosis would share common symptoms. I think I'm happy with where I am right now, but I look forward to the future. A future I hope I will remember.
