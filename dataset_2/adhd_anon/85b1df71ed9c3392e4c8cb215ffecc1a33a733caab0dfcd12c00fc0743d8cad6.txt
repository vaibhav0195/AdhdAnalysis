April 19 for those living in Maine or Massachusetts.  *Canadian folks: your taxes are due April 30.*  ---  #Please set aside at least 15 minutes sometime in the next week to do your taxes or to file for an extension.  Make ten calendar events if you have to. And five alarms.  ---  __Extensions__: https://www.irs.gov/Filing/Extension-of-Time-To-File-Your-Tax-Return   Do not forget to also file for a state extension if applicable. Also, obligatory reminder that an extension is an extension to file your tax return, not an extension to pay (which is found here and generally only for people struggling to make payments: https://www.irs.gov/Payments). ___But the underpayment penalty is usually peanuts in comparison to the penalty for late filing.___ Ideally we avoid both, but sometimes shit happens, you know? No shame in extending it even if you end up filing by April 18th anyway.  ---  __Free tax prep help for those with disabilities (read: us!) or that make $54k/year or less, or do not speak English well__: https://www.irs.gov/Individuals/Free-Tax-Return-Preparation-for-You-by-Volunteers  __Where to find software or a tax pro to help with filing taxes__: https://www.irs.gov/Filing/E-File-Options
