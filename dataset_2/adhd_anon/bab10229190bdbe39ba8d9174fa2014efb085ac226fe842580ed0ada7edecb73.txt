(It's like free ADHD coaching!);;;**Start momentum in your week with Kick-Start Sunday and Momentum Monday** -- This should be bigger than ever since we have over 3300 reADHDitors (70% in the past 5 months)!  Kick-Start Sunday is where /r/adhd can share the goals, tasks, or habits we want to accomplish this week.  By sharing here you will be held gently accountable (which is a good thing!) and we can check in with you...helping YOU get things done.  *I suggest you read the whole post -- you* can *skip it and just make your list, but you’ll be more successful if you put in the little extra initial effort and continue reading....*  *** ## Choose the participation method that works for you: * **Most important task** - Share one (or a couple) **HIGH-PRIORITY** tasks that you really would like to finally finish.  *(Ex. Set a doctors appointment, finish assignment, clean the kitchen...whatever YOU think is most important.)* * **Make a list** - Post a list of all the things you want to accomplish this week.  *(I highly recommend identifying the top 3 priorities.)* * **Feed your soul** - Sometimes by relaxing and having fun we have more energy to get more done. **List a couple FUN items to make your list more exciting.**  **Need/Want to copy last week's list *verbatim*?  Absolutely DO SO!**  *Those might be your keystone habits. Once you start doing those regularly you are able to do more. soon they will be automatic and you can put your focus elsewhere.*  *** By sharing our goal(s) with this understanding community, we can keep each other **accountable**...and **celebrate our successes**, large or small!  **Don’t forget to return for [Win Wedenesday] to flaunt your successes!**  ;-)  By getting one small task done it creates **momentum**, **trust** in yourself, **confidence**, and you will feel like doing more.  ♥ ♥ ♥ **Never posted on Reddit before?** I welcome you to make this your first! ☺☺☺  *** ## Suggested Guidelines * **Prioritize your list.** One thing you want to get done (or start). What is the most important thing for you? (If making a list works best for you feel free to do that too!) * **Add a finish OR start deadline.** By committing to a date/time, we can check on your progress. * **Edit your comment when done.** - Come back and edit your comment when you have finished your goal.

Our working memories are flaky.... * **Start small...build up slowly** - We want to build on small successes so committing to cleaning your entire house might be a bit too much to handle.  Pick a room (or a task like ‘pick up dirty laundry’)  instead. * **Want to study for 2 hours a day?** *Commit to studying 30 minutes to make it easier on you.*  *** ## Examples from previous weeks: * Unload the dishwasher. * Study X hours a day (though I suggest starting small with minutes). * Make an appointment with doctor. * Get ready and *leave the house* for *any* reason. * Clean car (get trash out). * **Start** *[something]*. “Spend 5 minutes on writing my paper.” *  many more....  *** ## *It’s now easier to respond!

The new weekly /r/ADHD thread for introductions and questions about being diagnosed/starting medication/whatever!;;;As /r/adhd increases in size, we find ourselves in a critical stage of development. We as a subreddit can either fall into a pattern of repetition (allowing our community to get bored/overwhelmed with repeated topics/questions), lost in a sea of memes/pictures/questions/noise, or we can proactively shift the tides towards making /r/ADHD a perpetually flourishing community based on scientific findings and personal discovery.  *** ## The main purpose of this thread:  * Provide a place for people to **ask simple questions** which may not need a dedicated post. * Give people **new to the  /r/ADHD community (and there are thousands of you)** a chance to say hello and share a bit about their strengths, struggles, and dreams.  *** We decided to start a new weekly thread on Fridays in an attempt to consolidate the frequent “beginner” questions and introductions into one place. After discussing this in our [/r/ADHD chatroom](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=/r/ADHD) the conclusion is that we must **address the increase in basic questions posted in /r/adhd.**  Of course, anyone can post a question, but this thread is especially geared toward people who **think they might have ADHD, have just been diagnosed, have questions about whether to medicate (or not), or to ask about possible side-effects.**, etc.  ## Also, if you’re new to our little community, (or even if you’re not and you just want to do this anyway!) this is the place to say hello!!  *By the way, these threads are going to help build /r/ADHD’s FAQ page, the current version of which can be found [here!](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/ADHD)*  **So, to get to the point of this thread, allow me to introduce /r/ADHD's introductory and basic question thread!**

Examples from previous posts:  * ***Put on all of your clothes (including shoes) before you do your hair, that way you can just pick up and go if you realize you're running late.***    * This one has actually helped a lot.  Before, I'd spend a lot of time making my hair look right, but I didn't have my shoes on!  Then I'd realize I was running late and I'd still have to do the basics and then I'd miss my train.  * ***Segregate blocks of time for like activities.***    * In my bag I have a tablet, a bluetooth keyboard, a sweater, my screwdriver kit, and a pair of headphones.  Before, I'd be running around packing this stuff up while also getting dressed, brushing my teeth, feeding the cat, etc.  Lumping these activities together has saved time and resulted in a more organized morning.  * ***If you take public transit and have a smart phone or active computer, make it a habit to check the times until the next bus/train comes to your stop.***   * This one is dangerous, so be careful.  I've often found myself checking the next train time on my phone only to be sucked into facebook or reddit or the chatroom.  But by checking how much time remains until my next train, I have a keen idea of when I need to be out of the door and what I can still do before I head out.  # *Not all of these will apply to everyone of course, but these are just a few that I have found useful for my mornings!*  Share what has worked for you to inspire others, tweak existing routines to be more efficient, come up with brand new things to do if you find yourself with some free time!  If you want, break down your morning from when you wake up until you have to walk out of the door and assign activities to specific blocks of time based on _realistic_ predictions of how long each activity will take.  ##### Keep an eye on the clock throughout each morning.  The best way to gain a sense of time, a sense of how long things take, is to look at the clock before and after (and maybe during).

Everyone, that's who. So share them!;;;##### WIN WEDNESDAY!!!  #####Science behind Win Wednesday * Scientists think our brain has a built in negativity bias by reacting more to a negative stimulus. In effect, our brain is like velcro for negative experiences and teflon for positive ones.   * Painful experiences are usually more memorable than positive ones and lasting, good relationships typically need at least a 5:1 ratio of positive to negative interactions.  * By **tilting toward the good** you are leveling the playing field.    * **Instead of positive experiences washing through you like water through a sieve, they’ll collect in the implicit memory deep down in your brain.**  * **Soak in the positive events in your life**   * By pausing and holding that positive feeling for a BIT longer, you are slowly changing the wiring of your brain.   * Much of this information comes from *The Buddha’s Brain* by Rick Hanson. Here is a PDF of his [*Positive Emotions and Taking In the Good*](http://www.rickhanson.net/wp-content/files/PositiveEmotions.pdf).

The whole point is to share how YOU won, and did not let your ADHD win!** Check out the examples to see what we mean!**  *** * The point of Win Wednesday is equally **to share our wins AND celebrate the wins of others!** If you do or don’t have a win, feel free to give positive support and cheer to those posting (not just upvoting)!  * **Each week Win Wednesday gets hundreds of views, but only 5 people replying to the winning comments...let’s change things this week!** Just saying “good job” means a lot to someone who has been struggling!  *** ##### PHENOMENAL EXAMPLES FROM PAST WEEKS:  * I graduated college!  Fuck yeah! * I paid off my credit card. * FINALLY hung my custom mirror that's been gathering dust in the hallway for about a month. * Finished some more group projects ahead of schedule so I'm not the one everyone is waiting on. * Today I realized I was the common denominator in many bad relationships that are most important to me. I told my loved ones this and started a new chapter today. Feels good. * So far, I've managed to make $90 doing different repair work. This is a pretty big deal for me, my ADHD is bad enough that I'm on disability * I had my highest GPA ever.[1]   with my most difficult courses ever * Got my blood work done, got stuff needed for other medical testing, and I set up an appointment with a woman's counselor to add to the therapy I am already doing * I'm late but I finally stopped talking about auditioning for a play at my local theater and did it!  * I got engaged. :) * I think I have finally identified a definable improvement of my meds. * Many many more!  ##### We love you, /r/adhd!

The whole point is to share how YOU won, and did not let your ADHD win!** Check out the examples to see what we mean!**  * The point of Win Wednesday is equally **to share our wins AND celebrate the wins of others!** If you do or don’t have a win, feel free to give positive support and cheer to those posting (not just upvoting)!  * **Each week Win Wednesday gets hundreds of views, but only 5 people replying to the winning comments...let’s change things this week!** Just saying “good job” means a lot to someone who has been struggling!  *** ##### PHENOMENAL EXAMPLES FROM PAST WEEKS: * Started reviewing for a stats test early...beat the curve...and no longer playing catch up in math class for the first time in college (PhD student). * Went to psychiatrist, started medication, feel more ‘normal’ * Wrote an essay and DIDN’T procrastinate until the last minute (not sure if I ever did this) * Went to doctor and is one step closer to ADHD diagnosis. Waiting for psych to call back. * I can change. I can learn to have goals. I can learn to have self control, and manage my time, and connect to people. I can escape the law of entropy.  ##### We love you, /r/adhd! BE PROUD and celebrate with each other! -- *your community managers.*  **Don't forget to join our other exciting weekly threads on Fridays and Sundays!**
