I have been recommended to go to the academic coaching and tutoring center, but have never been able to at any school.  I also avoid teacher/prof meetings like the black plague.  I dont really know why but i have.  Psychologist wants me to get a person to give me a kick in the ass to start work.  dreading that as well.  any ideas why i can't stand to get help? it seems to be an ADHD thing from what i have learned.  and suggestions on how to overcome it.

Also, what would ADHD in-attentive be? I know the diagnostic code thing is 314.00, but no idea what the various "shortcuts" mean in here.  Would be useful in my viewing and comments in here to know.

Having had an EEG in relation to my diagnoses (wouldn't be seeing Neuro otherwise...)  this looks like something that could help figure some shit out... like my sudden "craving" to build shit.
