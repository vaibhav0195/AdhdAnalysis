In a couple weeks I'll get the recommendations from the psychiatrist.   When I get my results, does it matter if I go to my family Dr. or can it be a clinic Dr. ? (Ontario, Canada) - Family Dr is currently unaware of this evaluation and I've never brought it up before.  TL;DR Does it matter if I see my family physician for diagnosis or can it be any physician?
