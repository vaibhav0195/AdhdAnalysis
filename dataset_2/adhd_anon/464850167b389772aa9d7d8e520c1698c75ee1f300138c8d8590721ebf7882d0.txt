I start naming with first elevens, Real Madrid starts the game and most times Pepe and Ramos gets early reds. (I know they are very good players but I dont like them)  Always I don't have a final score since I sleep even before the half time.

I couldn't asked this to him since I didnt knew ADHD well when he prescribed me.   I have been diagnosed with ADHD 2 months ago, my doc prescribed Concerta, started with 18mg for first month, now I am at 27mg. I am 36 years old, have 2 kids and I work as system admin, in front of computer all day. My psychiatrist told me I am not in a hurry in my life, as I have completed school times, so he doesn't want me to use Concerta all the time but whenever needed such as at work. For example he said you don't need to use it on weekends.   Of course I do have respect to him and any doctor, BUT. Taking Concerta early morning makes me more productive and feel better with calming down when I am at work, but when I get back home, concerta wears off and I became helpless. When I am at home, I have like 6 hours, trying my best to have time with family and some reading. Reading is important, I really love it and I am not watching TV to have more time for reading.  I haven't understood why my psychiatrist doesn't want to me use drugs for all day long. Anyone has an idea? Also, is there any known long term effects of using ADHD drugs for example 5 years? Is is allowed to use ADHD drugs for whole life?   TL;DR : My doc wants me to use concerta for only work time, but not home and personal time. So I am not good at home, not productive while reading, furious, not friendly to my wife and kids and cant do well on my own duties.
