So, between dealing with Walgreens sucking, my therapist's office and the insurance company, I'm coming up on two weeks without any meds.   So, I thought I'd share some of my observations of being off meds for an extended period of time:  * **One of the hits against Vyvanse is that it causes people to feel more anxiety/irritability**. I've definitely felt less of both since my little forced holiday * **Doing a better job of keeping up with things around the house than I thought I would** * **The ability to focus on things on work is severely diminished of course**. Reading isn't as difficult as I thought it would be * **Listening to spoken instructions is also difficult as it used to be pre-diagnosis** * **Overall fuzzy/hazy feeling is back.** I just don't feel as "sharp" as I do when I'm on my meds.     * **I'm not *quite* as tired as I was pre-diagnosis** Still more tired than I was while on my meds (though a six month old could also be contributing to that)  Has anyone else experienced anything similar (doing better than expected) after going on an extended holiday - forced or otherwise - from your meds?   **TL;DR**: I was forced to stop taking my 40mg of Vyvanse and have done much better than I thought I would. I'm not as afraid/paranoid as I used to be about skipping days now, but I'm definitely looking forward to getting back on them.
