I'd been having trouble focusing on my readings over the past academic year so I went and saw a psychiatrist. Based on an hour long visit with him where he asked me questions and observed my body movements (I like to tap/bounce my leg often) he concluded that I had ADHD. I am assuming it was a mild form of ADHD because he did not seem that worried about me. He said that I would get to pick the drug and the type of dosage (extended release, immediate) so that we could get a handle on the type of reactions I would have to the drug.  Based on initial research, I opted for Adderall (generic) extended release.   I am not really keen on taking medication daily, but mainly only when I have substantial amounts of studying to do (maybe once per week, and then regularly during finals week).   Did I make the right decision? I know that some illegally procured generic Ritalin extended release seems to be more effective for me than immediate release Adderall (at least I think it is, it's hard to tell what is working and what is placebo effect) and I have not yet had the chance to pick up extended release Adderall. WebMD seems to suggest (and some other sites) that that side effects are milder with Adderall. Random anecdotal sites seem to indicate it is also more effective.  Does anyone have any recommendations on which I should pick (outside of "try them all?"). This has been really nerve wracking and is seriously (ironically) impeding my ability to focus on my exams.
