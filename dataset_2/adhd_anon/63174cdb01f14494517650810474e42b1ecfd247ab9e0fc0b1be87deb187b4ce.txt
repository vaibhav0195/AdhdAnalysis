63174cdb01f14494517650810474e42b1ecfd247ab9e0fc0b1be87deb187b4ce;;;Distracted by eggs;;;This happened 5 minutes ago. The girl I am dating and I were over at a friends house next door for dinner. Afterwards, she started getting ready as we were all going to go out. She asked me if I could go to my place and pick up two things for her: Her skirt and chapstick.  I obliged, walked over, and gathered up the stuff. I then realized that earlier I prepared some hard boiled eggs for work tomorrow, and they were still shelled. "I should probably de-shell these" I thought, so I did. Afterwards I put them back in the fridge, and walked back over to our friends house.  As I walked in the door I realized I forgot the skirt and chapstick.   So now I'm back home, writing this post. This time I will not forget them.   Its funny how small things like this are a really solid reminder of how ADHD functions.
