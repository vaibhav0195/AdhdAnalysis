Most are fine but one in particular has ADHD. I have a hard time having him listen to me. He has certain triggers that will send him into HUGE fits of screaming. I have noticed that he likes to be in charge. If you tell him something is different than what he thinks it is, he will get worked up. Another trigger I have found is that if you accuse him of something he didn't do or thinks he didn't do, he will start screaming that you don't trust him. When this happens, I kneel down and literally get on his level and calmly have him explain the situation, tell him what I am going to do, and we go from there.      But there are times when the situation isn't severe enough for me to do that. Like today, he wouldn't sit down and eat his lunch, he found a toy he liked much better. I finally "Herded" him over to the lunch table and a more seasoned staff yelled at him until he sat down. I don't want to use that as my default. So far, I have been told that I am one of the two staff there that he listens to. So, my question is, how do I get him to listen to me without yelling at him all while respecting his disorder? Any help is appreciated!     **TL;DR**: A boy a work with has ADHD, how do I discipline/get him to listen while respecting his disorder and without shouting?
