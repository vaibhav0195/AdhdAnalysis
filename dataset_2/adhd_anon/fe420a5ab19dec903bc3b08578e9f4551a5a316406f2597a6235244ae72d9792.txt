I received my diagnosis today!;;;After a decently prolonged series of appointments and tests, i finally heard back about my results. The final diagnosis both relieves much frustration, and saddens me simultaneously. But hell, ive finally gotten an explanation for just about all that have troubled me in my life!  Official diagnosis: *Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Predominately Innattentive Presentation, Moderate.*  Also, the Pyschologist noted that special consideration should be given to the possibility of General Anxiety Disorder, as he saw signs of that, but not enough for a formal diagnosis. So that was interesting.. Also a bit of OCD, but barely out of average limits.  So, anyways, thanks to /r/adhd. You guys were really what catapulted my endeavour to make sense of my world, and who i am. When i had a question, i secretly lurked in the shadows, gawked at your stories and how incredulously analogous they are to my own odyssey, and learned so much invaluable information -- all from one place!  Ill do my best to pay it forward..
