When I picked her up in the afternoon, I was having a nice conversation with the day care owner when I spotted the bag. I said "OH! That's mine," and grabbed it. We all had a little chuckle about them wondering who left it there all day and then it turned topic into me informing them that I'm ADHD and not just ditzy and that if I ever forget something or get confused or whatever, that's the reason why.      The owner seemed shocked that I, a grown woman, was recently diagnosed as ADHD. She then said in all seriousness that I should "play brain games" to cure it.     I paused. Then I decided that I literally had no time to educate this woman on something clearly more complicated than she was expecting and just smiled and told her I was "already doing that."      And then I laughed and laughed all the way home. Sometimes you just have to accept that people are, understandably, uneducated about ADHD and there aren't enough hours in the day to take on that task. Oh boy...
