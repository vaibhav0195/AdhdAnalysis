ADHD'ers how have you improved your situation in the past while?  I will start: I have begun taking zinc, fish oil, and green tea with my breakfast. It makes such a big difference!

With this list we can have an idea of what we could be looking out for when we play the dating game.  i'll start: my ex GF was actually fantastic at keeping me accountable. She would ask me daily how my projects and assignments were coming along and would work out why and how i was getting stuck. On the other hand she was a bad influence. I would spend way too much time and money I really didn't have on her. I've noticed some girls will intercept my impulsive streaks with something like "wait, surely you don't have the money to buy us tickets for that. And didn't you say you have an appointment that day at the same time" you get the idea :)
