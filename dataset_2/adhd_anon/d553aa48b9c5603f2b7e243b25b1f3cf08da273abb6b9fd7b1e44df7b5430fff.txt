However, the last couple of months I had to take two sets of antibiotics which makes the pill not work as well, if at all. So we used condoms that entire time (latex-free, so the fit is not *quite* as good as latex but it is as good as we can get). I haven't taken antibiotics since well before my last period.  I have been on dextroamphetamine for about a month or so now. Had my normal period, and am now having a second round of spotting almost 2 weeks after my last period.  Not too heavy, but still enough to need pads.  I should add that I have also not been anxious or stressed lately, so that is not a factor.  Before anyone suggests it, I am seeing a doctor for my annual exam on Monday.  I just have problems with waiting (obviously).  Anyone experience something like this? There was a similar thread a long while ago, but did not get much response.  **TL;DR** Any ladies have breakthrough bleeding after starting amphetamines?
