My last relationship was 4 years long. We were actually engaged the last year and a half. I never told him. I wish I had! I think he would have understood me better, and possibly been more patient with me. I'm now dating someone. We are exclusive, but only about 3 months in. Since we have been clear with each other that we are both ready to settle down and get married, I feel like he should know. But when? And how? He's incredibly successful, wealthy, and totally organized. This man has his shit together. I appear to have mine together on the surface. But my finances are a disaster since I can't seem to keep track of anything... Anyway, back to the topic.   TL:DR we really like each other and there's future potential, but I'm afraid to tell him about my ADHD and I don't know how to do it.
