78909ddc54eb547fc53a9197219e257ee2febe49bc883a9e76a4211a424b8b5e;;;Im 21 and i was just prescribed d-amphetamine xr 30mg once a day;;;Most of the posts on this sub are about struggling and needing advice, structure, discipline, and so on. It might be uplifting to hear the opposite, i figure. I'm doing great, working out like an insane person every day, eating like an insane person at each meal, managing my responsibilities like an automaton, and loving life like never before. Hang in there, things change fast. I'm in the best shape of my life and i was just accepted to my local university, Texas A&amp;M in commerce. Im finishing my associates degree over the summer and spending time with my loved ones. Things couldn't be better in my cruelly lucky, extremely privileged, euphoric life.
