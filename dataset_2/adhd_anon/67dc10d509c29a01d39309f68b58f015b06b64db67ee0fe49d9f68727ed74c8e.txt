I'm after any insights really, but some questions to get you thinking:  How do you make life together work?  How do you manage your time?  Do you have a routine that has you relying on each other, or independently go about your days?  Are your symptoms similar?   How do you deal with your SO when they do the same frustrating thing you do?   Overall, is it easier having somebody who can relate?
