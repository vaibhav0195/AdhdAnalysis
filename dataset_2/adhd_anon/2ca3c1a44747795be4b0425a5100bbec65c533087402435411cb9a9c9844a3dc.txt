Though something that holds me back is my fidgeting and my sleeping. I Really would like to know if anyone here has any ideas on why no matter where i sit or what i do i can't get away from these problems? Are they ADHD related, or are they another problem, if so please tell me, it is ruining my life.   *edit* thank you guys for taking the time to talk, i will keep you guys updated on what happens and how i do. i read everything even the funny ones. it will all help i am sure.
