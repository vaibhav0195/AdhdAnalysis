Need help;;;Okay, i'm going to make this as short as i can.  * I've taken Vyvanse for around a year and i started to notice a tolerance buildup.   * So i told my doctor and he had me start the slow process of upping the meds (10mg for a week, 20mg for a week, etc etc) on Focalin XR.   * I was taking 50mg of Vyvanse for the year, so I obviously went through a bit of physical withdrawl. I mentioned that to my doctor and he said there is no withdrawl.. I know thats not true or else i wouldn't of felt so down and lazy.   * ANYWAY, as of today, i'm on 40MG Focalin. But the thing is, i feel even more distracted by random things than i was more than a year ago without any meds.. I'll start one thing, see something else, and just start doing that instead.   * One of the perks of that, is that whatever i do, its productive. If i'm doing homework and see something laying on the floor, i go and pick it up, once i do that, i start organizing stuff until i realize that i was suppose to be doing homework. Its frustrating honestly.   *So if anyone has any ideas of any other meds that would help, please tell me!  ----------------What i've had so far (in detail):----------------------  1.  Vyvanse 50mg for about a year  2.  Recently started taking Dexmethylphenidate (Focalin XR) 40mg. Been doing so for almost a month.
