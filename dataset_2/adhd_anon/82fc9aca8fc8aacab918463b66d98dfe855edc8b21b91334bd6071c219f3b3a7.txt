82fc9aca8fc8aacab918463b66d98dfe855edc8b21b91334bd6071c219f3b3a7;;;My parents never told my school I have ADHD, so i never got the help i desperately needed.;;;I have been on Medication since the 8th grade. I am currently a Senior in High School. I have always had problems with finishing classwork. I have failed a math class and 2 spanish classes in my 4 years in high school. I tried to do homework, but I would either forget or not remember what I was tought that day. I constantly zone out in class no matter how hard I try, at one point I was taking so much Adderall, I was losing weight due to the side-effect of loss of appetite.   I recently read my school handbook, and It was stated that "all students with learning disabilities will be given extra help or class time if needed." Of course I never got any of that. All my teachers probably just thought I was a lazy bastard who sat around with a blank stare all day. When I asked my Ignorant parents about it, they said that they never told the school because they thought the school would put me in class with "Special Ed".   At this point i fucking Lost it. I told my mom (Who is a religious nutjob) That she will never understand what it's like. You know what her response was? "Maybe you should stop listening to the devil telling you to stop focusing."   I am beyond livid right now. If my ignorant parents would have told the school 5 years ago, I feel like I wouldn't be put in a situation where I am barely passing High School, and facing 4 years of community college. All i needed was that little bit of help, but I never got it.
