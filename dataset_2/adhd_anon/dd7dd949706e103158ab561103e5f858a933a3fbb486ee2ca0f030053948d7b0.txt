He was just tested for the gifted program at his school and passed all the tests with flying colors. However, the district psychologist also recommended that I have him evaluated for ADHD. Now, I'm not entirely blind-sided by this suggestion. He has an older half-brother who has pretty severe ADHD and was diagnosed at age 5. I've also researched the characteristics of children with ADHD because I know that he behaves differently from other children his age and, man, does he have all of them. But now that it's really happening, now that the school has noticed and his teacher has noticed and we're moving forward with an evaluation and the chances that he's just "rambunctious" are getting smaller, I'm scared. I'm scared of the medications he'll be on and whether he'll grow out of it and if he'll be made fun of as he gets older. I'm scared that he won't reach his full potential because, even though he's the kind of scary smart that lets kids graduate from high school at 14, I know the drop-out rate is much higher among kids who struggle with this disorder. I'm sad that his life is going to be so much harder than it should have been. What tips or advice do you have for me, r/ADHD? I know this is long and sort of rambling, but this seemed like the right place to vent about my worries for my little man.

He was recently evaluated by his school and they have determined that he does have many of the characteristics of a child with ADHD (7/9 indicators for inattentive type and 8/9 indicators for hyperactive/impulsive type). Fortunately, it hasn't impaired his academic achievement (he was also just evaluated for and accepted into the gifted program), so he doesn't require an IEP, but they are making accommodations for him in the classroom. I made an appointment with a psychiatrist and we'll be headed there in a few weeks. What I'd like to learn from all of you is what your experiences were like in school, how old you were when you were diagnosed, what your experiences have been with different medications, and what strategies you use to cope in your everyday life. This subreddit has been incredibly supportive and wonderful, so thanks in advance for everything you share!!  TL;DR Tell me about your life, meds, and strategies for dealing with your ADHD

While reading before his upcoming exam, I keep coming across articles linking Celiac disease to ADHD. It seems that there is a correlation between gluten intolerance and symptoms of ADHD. Have any of you been diagnosed with both? Have your symptoms improved on a gluten free diet?
