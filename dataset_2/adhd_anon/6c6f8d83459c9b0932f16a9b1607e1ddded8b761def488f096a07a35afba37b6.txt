I dread the moment when I check my comments and notice several dozen votes coming my way.  What did I say, did I make sense, am I as usual ranting about a subject I have little or no expertise on and for some reason getting away with it?  And worst of all, people commenting and forcing you to come up with more ranting.  I'm pretty sure someone here will recognize the feeling, Reddit feels like a trap.  edit: rant, rant. I didn't even mention that even though I've been diagnosed, I haven't been prescribed medication for over a year now, just referrals. rant, rant.  What a great day.  Start with 1 incomplete rant, realize it's going to take an awful lot of time of editing and you haven't had breakfast or coffee yet, post rant with a comment explaining it will be completed at a later stage.  Browse reddit trying to relax, find something else to rant, get into a rant where you also know you will need a lot of time to edit, post it anyway as the small letterbox really doesn't allow for comfortable editing.  Especially because I tend to skip and connect so most of my sentences end reading like a collision of different sentences by the time I reach the end of my sentence.   Not to mention all those other things that are on my mind, which continually clash with my current activities.  I'm tired.
