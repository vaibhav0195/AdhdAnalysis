So we spend a good part of our lives chasing those reward chemicals, even to our detriment... in many ways that may not be obvious...  We read books about cool stuff (which is stimulating) when we should be studying for that math test.  We run on a wet surface (because we're impatient) when we should be walking.  We dominate conversations (we like the buzz of being the center of attention) when we should be listening.  And --depending on what we can afford-- we do dangerous thrill-seeking stuff like skiing, motorcycles, sky-diving,  etc (sometimes ending up disabled or dead)  All because we lack those reward chemicals.  What else?
