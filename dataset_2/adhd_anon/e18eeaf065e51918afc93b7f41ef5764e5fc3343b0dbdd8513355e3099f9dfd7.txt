I've been lurking for several months now, and was inspired by the sub to get my own ADHD case reevaluated after not seeing a psychiatrist for several years. I've been seeing a doctor since July. I just wanted to share (read: rant) my experience.  Biography blurb (you may skip): I was diagnosed at a young age, like a lot of folks, and bounced from stimulant to stimulant until my teens when I was put on Cymbalta. It worked well for me. Relieving depression and upping motivation got me through high school. College is a new story though, so I decided to see a doctor as an adult. So far I've been on Vyvanse and Adderall. End Biography blurb.  I'm still on my parent's insurance with Aetna and Medco. I'm so freaking frustrated with how hard they make it for me to afford stimulants as an adult! I understand that they are steering people away from what is essentially Speed, but what about the people that need it? What about me? If anything, because I am an adult now, I am less likely to abuse medication. I openly admit that had I been prescribed Adderall in my teens, I would have abused it. I was just that kind of angry angsty teenage girl. Now, I know better, and I want to be the best I can be. Why is it so hard for people to understand that?  My doctor prescribed me Vyvanse at our first appointment. It worked wonders for me - I love it. I am clear headed, and am more aware of what I need to do in the present and future. BUT, Medco won't cover it. Why? Well, my mother and I first thought that it was because there is no generic available yet. Medco apparently doesn't like new drugs.   So, I ask to be switched to Adderall. Got a script for Instant Release to take twice a day. Mom and I go over the coverage again. NOT COVERED. We do more digging and discover that pretty much any stimulant I could be prescribed won't be covered, simply because I'm OVER 18. That's all it is. I'm too old. I could abuse 'speed' in 10mg form.   Luckily, my parents are wonderful wonderful people and have paid full price for both medications. However, I don't want to do this to them. In order to be covered (even in part) I'd have to ask my doctor to call Medco and get them to look at my individual case for approval. If find this ridiculous given how busy doctors are, and most doctor's policies with new patients. I'm a new patient, I really don't think she's going to take the time to phone a company that will probably say no anyway.   So, if I can't get this situation fixed, I'll just have to rely on Cymbalta. My parent's help with enough, I'm not going to make them pay $200 bucks to help me, and there's no way a part time job would even make a dent. I feel screwed. I tried looking into outside help, like Walgreens Prescription Savings, and even they won't go near stimulants.   I feel like this whole thing is another jab at ADHD'ers from people who think we should just work harder. Such is life?    **TL;DR** - I'm frustrated that my insurance won't cover my stimulant medication because I'm over 18. Just another part of adult ADHD that sucks. Thoughts, opinions, advice, rebuttals, slaps in the virtual face??
