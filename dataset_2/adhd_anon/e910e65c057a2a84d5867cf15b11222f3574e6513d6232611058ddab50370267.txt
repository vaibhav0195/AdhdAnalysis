But I'm wondering if we can make it work. I really like her, she has some wonderful qualities and we have so much in common. It's very refreshing to connect with someone on this sort of level. Any thoughts, comments or suggestions by the group would be a giant help to me as to whether I should continue to pursue this as it feels right. Thanks for your time.
