I think now for 1 or 2 years something weird has happened. I lost my ability to be think stuff out in detail like when I have an idea for a design I try to focus on it but it is like a battle with Mr. poof gone and Mr. KEEP THE IDEA. But I can't.   Now to the problem,  my thought is literately numb. I think about nothing. I have no thought. I can only think when I force myself to it. I have no idea what is going on...  I am feeling like a mindless zombie.  Also I have this a lot: a Mental Block, Anyone has any experience with it? Everytime I try to do something I get some sort of mental block. something that just weirdly blocks me from doing it until I force myself to it. I have this in school and in normal life. I do not know how to explain it, it is quite weird.  I don't know if I should mention this but in the last 1 or 2 years I have became calmer and calmer. Like I do not walk that fast anymore, I do not think about everything and everything anymore. Oh and I can keep my head at the conversation. (sort of) at least better then i could normally.  not that I do not want that but at the cost of being a mindless zombie I rather be much more happy and jumpy like I used to. Well actually I do not want that. I rather be a happy jumpy tom then a chill moody annoyed Tom.  Does anyone recognize anything in my story or knows a solution?  Thanks!  Tom  EDIT: I take no meds but I must have tried almost everything. I stopped 2 years ago... (but that can't be it right, as far as I am concerned meds do that... right?)
