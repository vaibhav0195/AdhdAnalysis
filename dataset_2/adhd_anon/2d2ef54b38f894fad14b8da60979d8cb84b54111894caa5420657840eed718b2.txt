Helps me work, get in the zone, think deeper. Not worry about song selection. Why do i mentally or physically find this stimulating?

Basically Adult entrepreneur, who's life has been circling down the drain for almost 6+ years. Got Diagnosed, and have 30mg of Vyvanse a day, it only works if i basically starve myself, but no longer than 5 hours if i starve myself, if i eat normal i get 1 hour of focus.  It's such a bummer, feeling like a human being and able to focus for 1 hour, then you just feel WORSE then your old self, atleast your old self did 1 productive thing a day.   I get 40mg of Vyvanse on May 4th, which I can already tell you, wont be enough. And even if 50mg is enough, what happens after that tolerance builds up? I then have to switch to Ritalin, then Back to Vyvanse, then my tolerance is up, and i'm back to no meds, then what? I'm back to myself but possibly worse?   This is tortue, my life is spiraling down, and i get these small bits of "light", then im back into the dark. I do know that you have to build the tools, and i have been trying, I have an ADHD coach, and a Zen Mentor. Meditation helps with personal life, but so far not work. I really just want energy through out the day. I want my mind to just give me a chance to do something, anything.  TLDR: Just diagnosed after 30 years, business spiraling, don't think meds are a "long term" option. Just a temporary fix. And i basically need to accept this.

I'm an online marketer. I start a todo, and then doubt myself, and then i start seeing other oppurtunties, then i question myself is this the right opportunity. It's a vicious cycle, of is this what i should be doing now?   I highly doubt i'm not the only one with this issue, as most ADHD'ers are entprenuers. Can someone explain how the conquered this issue themselves?   I'm curious if it's a lot of therapy/CBT? or just more meds? lol  Thanks! :D

With only sleep and hunger where issues before. The issue is my compulisitive, wandering thoughts are still here, and my focus is almost worse.  Has anyone else had this issue? and how did you fix it?  I'm considering trying adderall XR with it, but once i start Adderall i could very well be on it the rest of my life.. :\
