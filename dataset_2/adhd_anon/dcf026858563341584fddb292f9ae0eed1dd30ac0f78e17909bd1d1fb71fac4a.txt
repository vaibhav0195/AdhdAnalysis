dcf026858563341584fddb292f9ae0eed1dd30ac0f78e17909bd1d1fb71fac4a;;;On Adderall, but plan on moving to UK this year. What difficulty will I have continuing medication there, or switching to something else covered by NHS?;;;tl;dr : Going to UK, probably can't get adderall, looking for suggestions/information on treatment in the uk and making continuing things as seamless as possible.  Currently, I am taking the following medication:  * Adderall xr 20mg  * Prozac 40mg   I understand that Adderall is nigh impossible to get prescribed/filed in the UK, so I am looking at potential alternatives. (Ritalin, Dexedrine)   As an alternative to a psychostimulant.  I was considering combining Wellbutrin with the Prozac. In the past I felt that it helped greatly with my motivation, though not as much with concentration. The downside is when I was taking it (only 300mg, no ssri). It tended to make me get much angrier when I did get angry.  I take prozac to deal with anxiety as well as making me far less temperamental/serene.  I heard that wellbutrin and prozac make a good combo, so i was wondering if i could go back to wellbutrin without dealing as much with it's side effects. I have also read that wellbutrin increases the amount of prozac in your bloodstream, so you might have to take less of it if combining.
