Just memorization or pure math. My whole life, up until this year, has been like this.  I have always known that focusing while reading was very hard for me, but as I said before, it never affected me much, and as a result, I never acted on this disadvantage.   Things this semester are different: each class I'm taking is so technical, the information cannot be taught in the class time given, and we have to do supplemental readings (or you will most likely fail to understand concepts ---&gt; fail class)  I'm scheduling an appointment with a primary care doctor soon (easiest for my insurance at first - if he needs to refer, that's okay, too). My only concern is that he will think that I'm faking the problem since I live in a college town and... that's what a lot of people do.  I am a really responsible dude, and put in the time and effort to achieve what I want, but due to this limitation it puts a hamper on other areas of my life due to having to read things 4-5 times and still not comprehending due to lack of attention.  Do you guys think I explained my situation well in this post, and do you think I'll have any problem getting some help? I really am frustrated with this, and I wish it didn't look like I may be lying due to not acting on it previously in my life.  Thank you for the help  **TL;DR**  * Always had problems with reading comprehension due to lack of attention direction * Never acted on it because it never really negatively affected me * Things are different with new technical classes * Will the doctor think I am lying, and how do I deal with this * Thanks
