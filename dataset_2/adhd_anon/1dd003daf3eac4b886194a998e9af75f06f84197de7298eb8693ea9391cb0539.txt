This is different from sequential storage like a book or a computer hard drive that has a front and back and you read information from going front to back till you find what you are looking for.  You can speed up sequential access by creating an index or using certain techniques to speed up access.  If you have an index then you can skip to the place you store the info.  If you know the storage mechanism (sometimes called an array, matrix, database, web, etc) follows certain rules you can speed up access by using techniques.  For example you want to look up the definition of the word memory.  If you know the book is a dictionary, and is in alphabetical order we can use techniques to locate the 1st letter the letter m, m is the 13th letter in the alphabet so we can look first in the middle or the half way point. If we land on the letter L we need to go further in, if we land on O we need to go backwards.  If we know the dictionary is 1200 pages we may then look at the word by splitting the book in 600 pages sections.  Followed by 300 page sections, then, 150, 75, 38, 19, 10, 5, 3, 2, 1.  Thus the most amount of searches we have to do is 11 to find the page that has the definition of memory on it. Or to put another way 2^10 is 1024 and 2^11 is 2048, 1200 is between those numbers so 11 steps is the simplest way to find the info.  This is how everyone finds information in a dictionary even if you are horrible with math.  Our brain instictually knows how to find patterns.  Our brain realizes the dictionary is in alphabetical order.  *A math strong person may know it takes 11 steps  due to him being good at math *A visual strong person will effectively cut the book in half's for the visual person sees the shape  and knows what a half is. *A feeler person may use their hands to feel the weight of the book and the pages and figure out what the half is by feeling the weight and separating. Etc with more ways of figuring this out then I can think off.  ---------  Our brain has several different parts and each one looks at the problem differently.  Our brain tries to solve the problem in the most efficiently possible, using the least mental energy to do so, thus conserving more brain fuel such as neurotransmitters and glucose.  ADHD people often have a strong sense of visual thinking for ADHD causes changes of neural development and neuro chemistry.  The visual part of the brain does not need as much dopamine and norepinephine to function for other neurotransmitters affect this part of the brain more than dopamine and noreinephrine.  Sometimes the visual section is overdeveloped than the average population for we ADHD people compensate for our lack of effective sensing and thinking in the parts of the brain ADHD makes us bad at.  Thus it is good to organize information visually for if we organize the information visually it is easier for our brain to see the visual pattern.  It is easier for our brain to make connections and recall things.  Other methods work better for other people depending on their talents and skill set.  ---------  Mind mapping is a way of trying to store information visually and establish visual relationships.    You start with one thing, usually drawn as a circle and develop branches with other ideas, things, traits.  It works even better if you can catergoze the information maybe use different shapes as classifcations, circles for nouns, triangles for verbs, squares and diamonds for adjectives and adverbs, etc.  Using different color for the branches to show the type or strength of the connection.  Aligning your style of organization to how your brain processes information makes it easier for your brain to recall memories and knowledge both short and long term.  ------------------  Anybody got any good recommendations?

Anger and ADHD, a rant and asking for help.;;;**TLDR How to deal with anger when it does happen even if it does not happen frequently.  Sometimes the anger is so raw you destroy friendships and relationships.  I am not an angry person usually and most of the time I have positive ways of expressing anger.  But sometimes it is so quick and white hot I do not know what to do, I just ask and then it is too late.**  &amp;nbsp;  ---------  Warning I am just letting all the emotions out and expressing myself so I will do things such as all caps and such.   I HATE BEING MY DAD!!!  I hate how sometimes I can not control myself.  I hate how only occasionally I lash out and cause so much pain at once and then the friendship or the relationship is unsalvageable.  I hate how I am not able to express my feelings, to put my feelings into positive words instead of destructive actions.   I hate how I reduce my emotions and empathy is everyday life for emotions and empathy come on so strong for me.  I HATE IT.  Not being able to feel until it is suddenly so strong.   I hate how instantaneous the transformation can be.  How I can go from a 3 in the irritation scale out of 10 to suddenly a 9.8.  How people are suddenly surprised how I can so quickly jump from such intensity.  How those people either stop having a relationship with me for I am too scary or too extreme.   I AM TIRED OF BEING ALONE!  I DO NOT WANT TO BE MY DAD, with two failed marriages, most of his kids hating him, and no real friends.  I do not want to be like him.   Like Dr Barkley says people will forgive many things from you.  They will forgive your eccentricities, they will forgive you impulses, they will forgive you when you are unable to communicate, they will forgive you being what they see as weird or different.  THEY WILL NOT FORGIVE YOUR ANGER!  I hate this.  Do you know how many relationships I have killed because of a single argument.  How I have literally lost a best friend in the past due to a single fight OVER NOTHING.  Just a stupid fight that happened in less than 1 min, arguing over something non important (It was economics and it was simply a matter of a difference of opinion.)  How I have hurt my brothers and sisters in the same way but maybe not to the same extent.  How I lost my other best friend at the time only a few years later, for I was dealing with emotional stuff, and I felt too exposed, to emotionally vulnerable, that I let the relationship die due to almost no contact for I was afraid of what I may do, or what that person would do to me.  I just could not handle it.  I now know this is due to ADHD and certain parts of your brain regulating your actions when you feel emotions.  It has to do with the fact your emotions are real, but normally a person has a part of the brain that is a filter, a conscious that holds them back, and not say the anger or say the hurtful feelings they are really feeling inside.  WHERE THE HELL IS MY JIMMY CRICKET.  Why am I so unlucky to be born this way.  Why the fuck I am the unique person that is like this, why I am part of the 5% or whatever the number is of people that have ADHD.  -----  What brought this post on was I had two fights with my sister I barely see during 48 hours during a vacation.  The first one was in the car where we had a disagreement over a word choice I used in a conversation.  I said allergies were toxins when I meant to say irritant but my brain went for the wrong word.  She would simply not let me speak, filibustering for over a minute, and not letting me correct myself.  NO I WAS JUST FLAT OUT WRONG AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT.  The second time happened less than 30 mins ago, for I was asking my mom what is our family history of allergies for I know of some but I was wondering if there was any more.  My sister raised her voice maybe 5 or 10 decibels, she did not even realize she did it, and on the anger/frustration scale she was only a 4 or 5.  My body instantly went to a 10, I yelled, did not remember what I said and then stormed out.  When I was alone and safe, only 2 or 3 mins later I felt safe enough to continue the argument in my head.  If you were to touch me during that brief window of me being so hot, as an unrelated person who may be trying to comfort me I would snapped, pushed you away and probably unintentionally cause physical harm.  Just do not touch me.  I sent her an email explaining why I got angry and a link to Wikipedia that showed some allergies are genetic some are not SO WE WERE BOTH FRICKIN RIGHT.  30 seconds later I sent her a second email apologizing.  I then wrote this post after being furious at myself and how I can not control myself sometimes.  I am so angry and hot about being ADHD, I understand it is neither positive or negative just different.  I understand some of my strengths come from my ADHD.  Yet I hate it.  I am about to post send, and I realized this right before I push post, I have not taken any beta blockers in the last 3 days even though I have been on them 1 a day for two months.  I did so for I have not had an anxiety attack since being on them though 1 or 2 close calls.  Right now my liver is acting up and stressed due to an unrelated reason so I figure I would not take the drugs I do not need to give my liver some rest.  I have since taken one, but it is way too late.  Take a pill may make you feel better but it does not erase the damage that is already done.  ARGHHHHHH I hate feeling this way.
1dd003daf3eac4b886194a998e9af75f06f84197de7298eb8693ea9391cb0539;;;Question about Vyvanse and my personal reaction to it.;;;So I am new to the medication thing for ADHD (recently diagnosed) but not for other mind altering substances.  A question (which I will also ask my doctor when I see him next in 15 days).  He started me off on the smallest dose of Vyvanse 20 mg.  I am also on wellbutrin xr 300 mg.  If I take it I do not feel it kick in until about **9 hours** later.  Even then I do not feel it but I am more productive during this time which I can notice if I am reflective enough to think about it, but I am not more productive during the first few hours.  1)  Is my body due to luck just taking for ever to split the lysine off the Vyvanse amphetamine salts?  2)  Or the dose is too small and I am just feeling the effects for the drug is at my peak?  I know you can't get me a definite answer I am just asking for personal opinions and experiences with vyvanse.
