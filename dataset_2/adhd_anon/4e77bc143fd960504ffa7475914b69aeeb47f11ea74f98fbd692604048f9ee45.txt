4e77bc143fd960504ffa7475914b69aeeb47f11ea74f98fbd692604048f9ee45;;;Diagnosed Adult ADHD, terrified to take meds... trying friend's Adderall tomorrow.;;;Was diagnosed about a year ago after years of slacking/not being able to concentrate at work without getting derailed by something stupid.  Went to a licensed psychologist after consluting with my general practice doctor. Went through all the official testing and was diagnosed.   Tried through therapy and books and all the tricks to kick it and that just didn't work. I was adament about wanting to avoid medication. I have read all about side effects and blah blah blah. But I just don't know if my fear of meds (I essentially think I'm going to lose my personality and become a walking zombie) is rational at all. I'm a new father and the last thing I want to do is come home to my 6 month old and not want to play with him because my brain tells me to go do laundry or something.  Recently a friend was also diagnosed and perscribed Adderall. She offered me a pill tomorrow, and I plan on taking it.  Basically just looking for support. As dumb as it sounds this stuff really terrifies me. But the ADD is affecting my work... I have been able to keep it hidden from the powers that be by pulling all-nighters etc.  First post to reddit too... so sorry if it's a crappy one.
