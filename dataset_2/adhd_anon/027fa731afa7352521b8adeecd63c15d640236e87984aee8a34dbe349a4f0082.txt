I have severe anger where I physically destroy things. For example, I purposely kicked a hole through my closet door. I've also purposely smashed several of my cell phones. I've physically hit people, etc.. I'm pretty reckless in that sense.  I don't know if that type of anger is more typical of bipolar, I guess.  I'm just trying to learn about ADHD anger, as I've been diagnosed with both ADHD and bipolar.
