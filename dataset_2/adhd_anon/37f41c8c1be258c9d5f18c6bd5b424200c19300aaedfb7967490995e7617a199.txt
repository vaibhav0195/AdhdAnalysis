Some serious things have changed, but the biggest is this: I am organizing an event.  The story goes like this- this summer I started working at my church and became familiar with a local non-profit called She Has a Name, which fights against human and sex trafficking in Ohio. I figured after awhile that I could organize a unicycle charity ride and fundraise in order to spread awareness of the problem and people who are trying to combat it. I pitched it to my 'boss' and he loved it.   Yesterday I sat down and for 4 hours made a rather well thought out and detailed goals list, action plan, calender, designated gmail and google voice account, then read up on long-distance unicycling and supplies. I now have SMART deadlines and a plan to follow through.  Before my diagnosis this would've been impossible. I stopped a second yesterday to reflect and laughed. I'm a new man. Thanks to this community, and if you're reading this and on the fence about talking to a professional about your symptoms, just do it. One of the most positive life choices  you can make.
