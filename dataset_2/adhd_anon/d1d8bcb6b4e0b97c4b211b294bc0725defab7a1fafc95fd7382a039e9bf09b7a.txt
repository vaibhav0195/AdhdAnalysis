d1d8bcb6b4e0b97c4b211b294bc0725defab7a1fafc95fd7382a039e9bf09b7a;;;Do you think while you talk?;;;I've found that often times when I go to tell a story or try to explain something to someone, I'm basically talking without thinking. Then I usually realize after I finish talking that I probably made no sense or was really scattered. I was wondering if anyone else had this experience.    I've never been diagnosed but I've suspected for a while, and even if I did I wouldn't be sure it had anything to do with adhd. I'm just curious your experience.
