On which they will judge if they should test me or not. I'm so scared at the moment, that they won't be able to help me. There's questions popping in my head like: "What if I don't have ADHD, what if I'm really just lazy, where do I go from here"  It's not like I want to be diagnosed with ADHD, I just want help for my problems. My life is a total mess, I have so many great ideas, but I can't seem to start on these projects. Everything I start never gets finished, even though I start enthusiastically, it always ends in failure. My friends don't even listen to me anymore when I got this great idea, because they already know I won't do it anymore. I can't even finish a video game. I spend to much money on things I don't need. My paperwork is a mess. My school is a mess, I missed all exams because I was too scared to go. When I started learning I got these panic attacks, and couldn't concentrate at all. It was like I was reading but nothing went through me. My house is a mess. Dishes almost never get cleaned. I can barely get myself to feed my cat (but I do). I always forget so many things, where I put my keys and such. I can't concentrate on much, if watching a movie I get distracted. When I'm enthusiastic about something, I'm unable to sit still. I go to bed late, feeling really tired all day.  And it's not that I'm depressed, I know that I'm not depressed. I've being this way all my life.  I'm sorry if this text doesn't make much sense. So what my question actually is.  If I don't have ADHD, can the Psychiatrist help me get my life back on track? And If I do can they also help me?  Is it too late for me to start chasing my dreams, and become what I wanna become? I'm 22 at the moment.  EDIT: Thanks for all the answer guys, the appointment is just a few hours away!
