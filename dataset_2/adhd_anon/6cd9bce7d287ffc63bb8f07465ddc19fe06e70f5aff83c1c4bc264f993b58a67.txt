I'm curious, how exactly could someone like me (who was diagnosed as a kid) get back on ADHD treatment?   To give some background, I was on ADHD treatment starting somewhere between 5 to 7 years old (I can't remember the exact age, may have been later) and stopped around 14. Since then, despite trying to ignore the issue, it turns out I'm having a lot of issues that are often ascribed to "ADHD", and I think it's about time I get back on treatment.   But..., I'm not sure how I'd actually go about that. I have insurance (though it's in the middle of being renewed, so I have to wait until I get my reinstated letter), but do I just go to my primary care physician and say "Hey, I have ADHD, give me meds!", do I need to provide documentation I was diagnosed? How do I go about this?  Thanks

My insurance does not cover psychiatry (but does cover primary care and a decent amount of specialist fields, though as stated, not psychiatry) but I want to seek treatment for my ADHD. I *may* be able to provide proof of it as I was diagnosed as a child and I could possibly be able to get the documentation.
