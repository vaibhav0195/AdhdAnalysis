I was diagnosed 2 months ago and I take 10mg Adderall twice daily and the difference is amazing. I am angry with myself because i waited so long and realized that I could have done much better in my undergraduate studies. I knew I had concentration problems but always put off seeing my doctor about it. Anyone else angry or regret not seeking a doctor sooner rather then later?  EDIT: I'm a Chemistry major as well and plan to apply for research jobs/ internships and would it be wise in an interview to say that my gpa isn't up to par because, (insert ADHD information here). I know there are people out there who believe ADHD isn't real and I don't want to ruin my chances in the interview.
