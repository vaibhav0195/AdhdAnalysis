dec80932e3634d390578b1d7302470a4f5dc7248dd0bcf74713df10a550ee8b2;;;Unable to contact psychiatrist = unable to get meds;;;so i go to school out of state and get my adhd medicine (vyvanse) at the school health center. while i was away at school my psychiatrist at home went MIA leaving me without any sort of contact.   I talked to the school health center and they wont prescribe the medicine over state lines. my primary care physician doesnt seem willing to prescribe it. I am taking rigorous online classes and need the medicine to help me take the tough courses.   Anyone have similar experiences and/or have some advice or tips? thanks
