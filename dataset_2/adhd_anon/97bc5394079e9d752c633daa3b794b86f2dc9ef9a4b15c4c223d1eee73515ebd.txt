I'm so impulsive and I always say things without thinking, like jokes that seem funny in my head and I say them before realising that it just sounds silly. I find it hard to socialise normally with multiple people because there are so many distractions and I'm so bad at just speaking in general, in my head o have pretend conversations all the time but when it comes to speaking I just get tongue tied and don't know how to just explain things smoothly. It's so hard to concentrate on what I'm saying and what I'm about to say next and what my friends are saying, all while getting distracted and zoning out.   So on the outside I just look like someone who's just dumb and silly and my friends rarely take me seriously... they joke about my stupidity, and I know they don't mean any harm, they're just joking around and I laugh along with it, but it hurts so much because there's nothing I can do about my behaviour. I try my best to just be normal but I always slip up and make a fool of myself.   I'm on a waiting list to get medication (I've already been diagnosed with ADHD a couple years ago) but I could be waiting for up to a year, because my country(Ireland) is a train wreck when it comes to mental health and disabilities.   And even then, my mom who also has ADHD, said her meds gave her awful side effects like anxiety, and she's tried a few different types.   I feel stuck and I'll never be able to express myself the way I am in my head. Does anyone else feel this way?
