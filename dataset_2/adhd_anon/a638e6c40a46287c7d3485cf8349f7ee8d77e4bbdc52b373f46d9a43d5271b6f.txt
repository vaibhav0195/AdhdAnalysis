The developmental delay has been interesting me though. I read it's about 1/3 behind normal and for me that means I'd be around 14. Personally that doesn't seem right, for me.   I definitely have some of the issues with emotional regulation and concentration issues but the developmental delay with social and emotional things I don't feel like I have. Is it possible to have some and not all of the symptoms?
