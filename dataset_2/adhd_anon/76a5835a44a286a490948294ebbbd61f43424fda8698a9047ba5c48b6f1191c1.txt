I knew it was coming, but part of the diagnosis included career recommendations.  I am a bit slow in math, and as such it was recommended that I should not pursue a career that requires advanced math.  This is a bit problematic, because I am in school for marine science, and this requires at least calc I to graduate.  I could possibly take a BA route that would only require precalculus to complete, but I'm worried it will limit my options.  So any scientists or engineers here who can relay their experiences in the field?  Should I seek other career fields? It doesn't seem like I would really need a whole lot of math to practice marine science, and I feel like with accomodations, I should be able to complete the advanced math courses no problem...but I am just starting out in my degree path, so I may be wrong about that.  Any one have any thoughts on pursuing a career that requires math, and their experiences in such a field? Thanks in advance.
