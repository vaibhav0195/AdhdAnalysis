After fifteen years coping with my ADHD-PI with the help of medication, I've now been off meds for about seven months (incl. three months while we were still trying). I'm now about four months pregnant and I reckon I won't be able to go back on them for another year at least. It was pretty terrifying at first thinking that my life would return to the constant failures I racked up before proper treatment. While that hasn't happened, I find that I've pursued a career that requires sustained attention and engagement, and also set personal standards for myself that I find very difficult to meet now. The daily struggle to stay on task has returned in a big way, and it's driving me bonkers. Not necessarily looking for any advice here, just feeling a bit alone in this right now and wondering if anyone else has gone through it.
