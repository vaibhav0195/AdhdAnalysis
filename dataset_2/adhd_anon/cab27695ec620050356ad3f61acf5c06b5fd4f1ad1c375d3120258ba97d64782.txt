My 10-year-old step-son was diagnosed with ADHD-Hyperactive about 4 months ago. He had gotten to the point where some would have labeled him ODD, refusing to go to school, arguing about everything, etc. (You could literally tell him the sky was blue, and he would pick a fight and argue about it).  He's since started taking Concerta, which has been remarkably successful for him. We've also adapted our parenting style (using the Love and Logic method), which has also helped a lot (we no longer argue, lecture or bark commands when he's acting up). Things have gotten much better.   But I wanted to ask you guys what do you wish your parents would have done (or maybe what they did do) that would have helped you be more successful at your life now?  My son is a smart kid, and I'd love to hear from others who've been there so he has the best chance at a great life later.
