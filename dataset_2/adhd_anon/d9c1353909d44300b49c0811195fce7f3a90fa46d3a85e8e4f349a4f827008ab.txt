In High School I finally came to the place where I recognized I had something going on, and then came the ADHD diagnosis, and the drugs.  At first I was excited by them, and I got so much more done.  My writing improved, my life improved; my room stayed neat and organized, just how I'd always pictured I could do.  My homework?  Done.  AND I still had time left over for video games.   Then I quit.  I felt like a fucking bum taking the damn things.  I felt like I was cheating.  Somewhere between my acknowledgment of my limitations and my American inability to accept defeat I gave in and stopped taking the pills.  My symptoms returned in force, but I knew they would and I was prepared.  I became obsessive about time management techniques, breathing exercises, had various stints with exercises like running and boxing (boxing is amazing btw), and I kept my life in check.  Without the aid of the meds I not only increased my GPA I have been on my school's Dean's List every single semester.  I'm earning three degrees in parallel and I graduate this May.  Thanks to all my techniques and methodical planning, I accomplished what even regular people seldom do.   ADHD was, at best, an inconvenience that made my days a bit irritating, and a bit of a struggle, but goddamnit I beat the shit out of that ADHD.   Until I didn't.  I definitely still struggled.  Looking back I see that.  But it'd always been an inconvenience, never dangerous to me or anyone else.  That changed a few days ago.  I play music on my phone when I'm in my car, so it's always in front of me and sometimes at stopped traffic I play with it.  I was being particularly fidgety with my phone that day, and I kept coaching myself to put the damn thing down and pay attention to the road.  I did.  I beat my phone with self coaching, just like I've always beat my distractions.  But my mind was in a frenzy, the car wasn't keeping my attention, it seemed like every second I had to steer my eyes back to the road and off of the newest billboard or house rental advertisement or pretty girl driving a red â€” **WHAM**.  I rear ended a car that stopped in front of me.   I had time to stop.  I even saw them stop in my periphery.  I couldn't control my focus enough to hit the fucking brakes in time.  Fortunately, the road was in town and the traffic was stop and go (another reason I should have known to pay attention) so I wasn't even up to speed.  I probably hit them at about 20.  $2400 in damage to my car.  I've never been in a wreck before, and definitely never hit another car.  I drive professionally for crying out loud.   I've always been mad at my ADHD.  It's nagged me, cajoled me, stolen my focus and made relationships difficult (Yes, honey, I'm looking at the phone but I'm also listening to you promise), but it has never endangered my life or someone else's.  Now, I've never been more terrified of it and I would do anything to make sure I never put myself or someone I love at risk because they're in the car with me.  I already lied to everyone about what caused the accident, so I'll never be able to come clean about this to the people close to me.  Inside, though, I'm doing everything I can to make sure it never happens again.   **TL;DR**  I stopped taking pills because I'm a proud asshole, thought I was winning until I couldn't control myself and ended up rear-ending a car.  Scared shitless.  Going back on the meds.
