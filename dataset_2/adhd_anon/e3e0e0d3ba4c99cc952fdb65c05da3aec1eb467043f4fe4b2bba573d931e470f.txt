Since then - I've been trying to find out how to get professional help on it! So far I have...  1.) Been through the NHS system - 6 sets of pills, 1 month each - zero positive results.  2.) Talked at length to an online therapist.  3.) Attempted a referral to private healthcare but my work health plan (BUPA UK) does not cover anything after the diagnosis and I'm not a multi-billionaire so no luck there.  I'm really not sure where to look next! I don't feel like I'm any further forward than I was 10 years ago with this (I'm 29 now) and I seem unwilling to get the professional help I require.  Does anyone have any advice on next steps? I was planning to do some research on health insurance providers which *DO* cover pre-existing ADHD diagnosis treatment but I'm not sure where to start. Looks like BUPA UK don't cover this, AXA doesn't cover anything pre-existing - very tricky.  Alternatively - an online service with the ability to provide medication (if necessary) would be great - so far I've only found psychiatry-uk but I'm not sure if they're reputable.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  TL;DR: Got a diagnosis 6yrs ago. Need to know where to turn next for help.
