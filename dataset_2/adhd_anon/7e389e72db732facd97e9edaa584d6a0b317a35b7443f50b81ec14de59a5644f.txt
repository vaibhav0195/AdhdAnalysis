7e389e72db732facd97e9edaa584d6a0b317a35b7443f50b81ec14de59a5644f;;;Should I tell my future employer about my prescription before I take the drug test?;;;I take 60mg Methylphenidate CD every day, I have a valid prescription, and I have to take a drug screen.    I have been offered a part time job from the place I've been doing my internship at. They want to hire me on full time after I graduate on May 8th. I have been avoiding talking to them about my ADHD diagnosis, but in order to gain employment with them, I need to take a drug screen.   TL;DR: Should I email my boss before my drug screen about my medication and therefore inform her about my ADHD? Should I bring my prescription to the drug screening place? Or should I stay quiet until it shows up positive?   Any help would be greatly appreciated!   **Edit**: I took the drug screen and I was clean for everything! I guess the Methylphenidate CD was in a low enough dosage. Before I took the drug screen, I told my employer that I was concerned about a prescription showing up and she told me that if anything shows up then the technician will contact me and I will give them the pharmacy's phone number to confirm. Thank you for the advice!
