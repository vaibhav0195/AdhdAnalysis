I've been diagnosed with BP (which I'm certain is accurate) and now he diagnosed me with ADD. I did a little research and asked about having an ECG before going on any stimulant. It's possible my late parent may have had a heart murmur and a few times a year I can get intense but short-lived chest pains.     He insisted that it wasn't necessary and that these medications are safe. I'm unsure and wanted to see if anyone else has been in the same boat. Thanks!
