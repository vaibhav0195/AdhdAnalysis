This in combination with acute bronchitis caused my 3 years bachelors degree to turn into a 4 year one.   I'm called for a job interview soon (system install engineer if it matters) and I'm pretty sure that at one point they will ask me why I took an extra year.   Would it be smart to mention my ADHD? I know it's a double edged sword but now that I've found working meds I can feel everything is going a lot better and I'm hopeful for the future. But I'm still afraid that just mentioning it and using it as an excuse will be enough for me to get rejected.
