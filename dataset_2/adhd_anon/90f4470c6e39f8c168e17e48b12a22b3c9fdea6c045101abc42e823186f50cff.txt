When I hear unexpected or random repeated sounds it is all I can think about.  I also seem to hear very quiet noise that others cannot.  My upstairs neighbors let their television drone for over 2/3 of the day.  I spent  1-2 months sitting in my room in agony over the constant, low bass bleeding through my ceiling.  This ultimately lead to me seeking help and being unofficially diagnosed.  I cannot break the lease or move into another room in the same complex.  I have several months left here.  I have asked the neighbors to lower the volume.  I have resorted to contacting the landlord.  I wear headphones 90% of the time I am awake.  I have a box fan on the highest setting.  The bass still bleeds in.  I have to be awake from 2 a.m. until I leave for the office if I want to work / read / whatever in peace.  I do not know what to do.  I am posting this here because I believe my noise sensitivity is related to my condition.  Has anyone else encountered this situation?  Does anyone have irregular suggestions for drowning out this noise?
