I'm a 20 year old college student who was just diagnosed with unspecified ADHD along with a learning disability. When talking to my psychiatrist about what "unspecified ADHD" means I'm still left with some confusion. Does this mean that there is a chance I don't have ADHD? I've never heard this term before so I just want to make sure I'm clear. I have always been worried that all of my issues happen to me because I'm lazy (which is what everyone has always told me). Now having someone tell me my issues are not my fault is extremely relieving, but I still have that nagging voice in the back of my head saying it's not real. I think once I can fully understand this unspecified portion I can truly accept this, start getting treatment, and stop subconsciously blaming myself for my downfalls.   Sorry if I'm a little ramble-y I'm new to reddit!   I mainly want to know, does an unspecified diagnosis carry the same weight/legitimacy to a specified one?
