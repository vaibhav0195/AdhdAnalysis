69d3e966e5b16ab03c2920c10f010bd0948478fcab15d02864c30b92e2d63941;;;Struggling to keep my shit together lately;;;I was diagnosed officially at 15 but didn't start medication consistently until I was about 18 or 19 and now I'm 26 - I'm beginning to become more aware/cognizant of challenges that I didn't understand might actually be contributed to my ADD/ADHD or perhaps that I very naively thought had evaporated with the use of my medication - things I put off as non-issues only to now realize these things might've ambushed me a little, all incognito-like while I wasn't looking.   Am I the only one? Please tell me I'm not - I know I'll get passed these things in due time but it'd help me feel less alien to know someone else can relate :)
