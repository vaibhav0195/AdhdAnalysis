I dont trust him, and I know I shouldnt, right now anyways. He gets treatment, Including for the lying. I know a trait of ADD can be lying - but how far does that explanation go? I feel like he use it as an excuse instead. Its about big or completely trivial things, and has now come to the point where I question every word that comes out of his mouth. We recently just got back together with the promise that there would be no more, but he just lied again, about something I knew was a lie. I have told him that if he accidentially lie he can correct himself, but the rollercoaster after the lie is what concerns me about him actually wanting to get better. First he will try to make me believe Im imagining things, then he will tell a lie. If I in situations know he is lying and let him know, he will first get extremely defensive, he will then tell me its my fault he did it, he will then go in 'child'mode, big arm movements, smiling/laughing and only respond with "hm", then he will turn cold, and then finally he will sort of apologize (without really taking responsibility for it, and instead making it about if Im going to leave him).  I have a hard time excusing this with add and Im not sure I should even try to explain it from that point of you. I know other people with the diagnosis and they do not behave like that.  What do you think?
