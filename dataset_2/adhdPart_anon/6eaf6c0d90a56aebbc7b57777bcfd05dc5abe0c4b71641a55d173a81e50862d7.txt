6eaf6c0d90a56aebbc7b57777bcfd05dc5abe0c4b71641a55d173a81e50862d7;;;I'm having trouble figuring what I should do;;;I'm fairly new to reddit so I will try my best.  I'm currently M(21) and my girlfriend(21) that's has adhd in our relationship. Our first three month were the best and now going into our 4 months in our relationship. Sometime it feels like I'm am unwanted and I know that they get distracted very easily and I have come to understand that. Dont get me wrong i love her so much and willing to do anything for her. The fact that sometime I want to have a conversation or sometime wish for her to show a little bit of emotion but everytime I do get into a conversation with her usually after 5 min she does something else which I understand that normal and she usually tell me that she listening to me talk but the longer it goes on she get distracted by what she doing and I usually leave her be.I also do notice that when I truly tell her how I'm feeling and being honest with my feeling  sometime the conversation switches from me explaining how I'm feeling to her explaining that something in her body is not feeling good and which I switch gear to help her calm down I dont know what to do to be honest and the thing is that she told me that it feel like I dont trust her when I do. Sometime it does feel like I put in the most effort and give her all the attention in the world and I want to stay in a relationship with her cause I love her so much I'm just very confused and I want to get better for myself and for her. Thank you for listening to me I know I left out some information
