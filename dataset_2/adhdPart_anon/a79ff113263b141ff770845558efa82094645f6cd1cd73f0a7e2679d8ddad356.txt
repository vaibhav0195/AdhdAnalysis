a79ff113263b141ff770845558efa82094645f6cd1cd73f0a7e2679d8ddad356;;;He keeps shutting me up whenever i have a question.;;;Every time i try to talk to him about any concerns. He turns it into argument and into me being naggy or annoying.   I am currently staying at his parents house for a visit. I have noticed that his mom keeps asking him to wake ip earlier and be more motivated and to do something useful. He alwaysa says ok i will without actually doing any single thing.   So I talked to him about it, I asked ‚Äú don‚Äôt you feel bad when you keep telling your ‚Äú I understand ‚Äú or ‚Äúi will‚Äù without actually meaning it?   He started defending himself by saying i want everyone to get off my back and stop nagging. I tried to go back to the question i asked because I obviously fucking missed the point of my question. He kept saying i am not doing anything wrong it‚Äôs my life and ill do what i want. So i got mad and raised my voice a little bit out of frustration. He. Went. Crazy. He said stop raising voice ‚Äú while screaming his ass out‚Äù mind you i didnt scream i just raised my voice out of frustration. Ofcourse the conversation ended right there.   He tried to open it up again by saying i dont like your tone and i dont like when you keep asking me to do things.   How the fuck did i ask him to do anything. How can someone be so stupid and so slow with understanding a very clear question. How can someone manipulate the other to this extent. How can a person manipulate someone so concerned about his well being and about hurting his own mom?  I am so tired.
a79ff113263b141ff770845558efa82094645f6cd1cd73f0a7e2679d8ddad356;;;Every conversation turns into a fucking argument.;;;We went for a walk to get some fresh air and time alone out of his family‚Äôs house. He asks me how i am feeling lately and i say ‚Äú my depression is getting strong again and I need to go back home to start devoting time to work on myself‚Äù and all i get is a fucking ‚Äú i am sorry to hear that‚Äù  Is it too much to ask for some sympathy? Some reassurance???  I decided to be patient instead of being angry and waiting to get more reassurance so I asked for more reassurance and this fucking dude gets angry and start kicking rocks like a child. Then i tell him ‚Äúhere we go again every time i try to talk about my feelings u get angry and turn it into an argument‚Äù. I get upset and go home and he acts like everything is fine for an hour while im alone in my room then comes and says ‚Äú wanna continue our talk?‚Äù Like nothing just happened.   I know its ADD to be fucking slow but wtf do i do here? He promised he wont be rude anymore but hes been promising that every fucking time we have any talk. I am so fucking hurt and sad. #vent
a79ff113263b141ff770845558efa82094645f6cd1cd73f0a7e2679d8ddad356;;;Been thinking about leaving for a year but i am too chicken.;;;I love him so much, he is the best partner I have had when it comes to showing kindness and respect. If he wasn‚Äôt a great loving person I would be long gone  But our relationship is destroying me. And he always blames it on his ADD and the way his personality is because of his ADD.   We have had issues since the beginning of our relationship about our communication. We are also long distance which was pretty hard but we got used to it. At the moment im staying over his place (his parents place with his family) for a month or so after being apart for 8 months due to covid.   I will admit that at the beginning of our relationship. I have had jealousy issues and trust issues. I have worked so hard on it and got over it without his help. Anyway I realized soon after that it was hugely his fault due his lack of communication and his ADD. For example: he would say something about a situation he has been through and then contradicts himself later on. Fast forward 3 years later not much has changed. Whenever i try to talk to him I feel misunderstood or ignored or gaslighted. He hasnt had a job in over a year but claims he is trying his best and applying everyday. All he does is smoke weed and play video games. I have given him a list of things to work on last year, inorder to grow as a person and to make our relationship better with better communication.  He claims he has done so much and has worked so hard but i feel gaslighted all the time. When i ask what exactly he worked on he says he can‚Äôt explain it and its all mental things he can‚Äôt give me an example. This relationship is taking away all my energy with me trying to understand him, and trying to not feel ignored all the time. I ask questions sometimes and get no response or a response to something i didnt even ask???? I have studied ADD so much and sent him so many articles and found many therapists to help him to the point where I neglected myself. I have mental issues too ( i have BPD)  but i am too busy trying to fix him and fix us.   He finally admitted last week that he was lying to himself for a year or so when he claimed that he is ‚Äúworking on his weed addiction ‚Äúand that he hasnt really done anything to improve it. Basically lying to me whenever i asked him about it. I forgave him because i know he was going through deppression and i am deciding to give him one last chance but the question is what the heck am i waiting for?? Until when? I feel lied to and misunderstood all the time  We keep arguing amd arguing and i stay because of the persuation and promises of things getting better. And it does for a while until it doesn‚Äôt.   Anyone with an ADD partner have an advice on how to deal with all this?
