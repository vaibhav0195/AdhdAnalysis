My fiance (26m) was diagnosed last summer, after a lifetime of random diagnosis that his parents didn't care about. Basically, dude is 26 and just stating to learn how to function with ADHD.  He has a lot of problems with compromising with me. I have C-PTSD, so we both are neurodivergent and need things done a certain way. I try to come up with plans that are flexible for us both, and usually, if he disagrees, he shoots the whole plan down and defaults to a "my way or the highway" mentality.  Example; today, I paid for 2 new televisions that'll be picked up next week (thank you, curbside pickup). I want to get the one good tv potentially sold, and suggested we post it for sale this week. That way, someone could either reserve it or even pay in advance, and once we got the new TV's set up, have them come and get our old tv. He cuts me off and speaks over me to say "I do to like that plan, no." And that's it. No other explaination, no compromise. I made an effort to better explain my reasoning, as well as the pros and cons of my plan, and he continued to be dismissive of my plan. It became an arguement, of course, which I had been trying to avoid.  Now I'm not looking for advice on whether my plan was good or not. I am a very flexible person, I am willing to work with and around him in order to make things work, but I unfortunately end up doing most things by myself to avoid fights and conflict in general. I end up exhausted and without my own needs met because he can't be bothered to try and work out a flexible plan that works for the both of us.  What are some tips or resources I can utilize to not only help my partner see that he isn't allowing us to work together, but to also help him see that he makes situations harder on me because he's only considering his needs and wants?
