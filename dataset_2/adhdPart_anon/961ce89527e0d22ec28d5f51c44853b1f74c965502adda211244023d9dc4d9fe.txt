I broke up with my ADHD bf. I couldn't take anymore. The drinking got to me in the end, he told me he'd be home in an hour, I don't care when he is home, he is free to enjoy himself, what I had a problem with is these weird promises or expectations to gives me and when he isn't home in an hour, I'm the one with the problem. I rang him, and he said to his friends "I'm gonna go, I'm in enough trouble as it is!" - I also expressed him being rude to me when drunk which I don't like. I don't like the bath full of vomit so it's clogged, I hate not being able to shower or the stench that it left, it blocked the drain. This is most nights when he drinks, he spends hours being sick.   I am intolerant to alcohol, he knew this. Once I said I'm not comfortable, he asked his friends to back him up and say "Yeah, drinking is unpredictable, can't help it if we vomit for hours when we get in". This has been the case for 3 years. This along with any other requests just makes him go into defensive mode cus he wants to be "normal". I always say ADHD is not some horrible thing, it's something we can work with and improve on the stresses of life together. But alas it was not to be. Thanks everyone on here who has helped me and support me.

The sex was always an issue and I have tried to be patient with him. It's reached a point where I don't have any sexdrive because I know the sex will just be him getting distracted, realise, get anxious, then it's a premature ejaculation as i think anxiety feeds this?   I don't even think I want any advise or solutions, I think I've just had enough of it being one-sided as horrible as that sounds. Anyone else experience the same? For me, sex was always about connecting. That lack of connection, I guess really ruined the way I felt about him and I think I've fallen out of love.
