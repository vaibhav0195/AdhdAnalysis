My (25f) partner (23F) of 5+ years has a lot of symptoms and ways of being that are very relatable to ADHD and even reads the ADHD subreddit frequently and tells me “oh my god I totally relate to this” pretty much every time she reads something. Yet, she refuses to get any kind of help or even just to go and find out if she has ADHD or something of that nature because “what if it’s just how I am?” Or “nope. I’m fine, I’m just a mess.”  This drives me crazy cause to me if you clearly are unable to focus on things and have a lot of textbook symptoms and life is getting harder and harder to manage you would go get some help to make it manageable since it’s affecting literally everything around you. She doesn’t get this and I don’t know what to do.  I’m honestly just trying to find a way to support her whether or not she gets diagnosed.  So say all that to say, any one have advice on how I can learn to help her/manage my frustrations when it comes to things that she can’t seem to help?
