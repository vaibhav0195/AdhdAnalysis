My dx husband and I both came from severely dysfunctional families. When we met, I thought we would develop a partnership where we would build a better life together. Now we have some serious dysfunction in our own relationship.   There is a scene in the show called Black AF where the main couple argues, and the husband acknowledges his flaws, and then jokingly asks his wife “well what kind of person are you to be married to a person like me?”.   And that’s how I feel about most of us. Why did we connect with our spouses in the first place? What attracted me to my mess of a husband? What kind of deep issues do I must have in order to fall so in love with someone with such deep issues?
