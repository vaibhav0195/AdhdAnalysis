This study can be completed in person or via skype. Those interested in participating can complete the [screener](https://nyu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_d54FFAjmm9VxEKp) (should take about 5 minutes). Please email me if you have any questions!  Thank you in advance!  https://i.redd.it/0brs1wwiqez21.png  **Michael D. Levy, MA**  Doctoral Candidate Counseling Psychology  New York University
