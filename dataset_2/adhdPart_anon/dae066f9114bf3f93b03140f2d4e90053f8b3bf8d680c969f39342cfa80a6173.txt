She has an appointment to see a psychiatrist in a couple weeks and has just started seeing an ADHD specific therapist. I think im going through some stages of grief. I must have passed denial (it's going to be OK, she'll get treated and be able to have a normal life) and now im angry/depressed. Im afraid she won't ever be able to get her shit together enough to have kids or have a career and I'll be supporting a grown child that can't get a real job or take care of a family. She has a few personality traits that make it extremely hard for her to move forward: she cannot ask for help (I have to force it on her), she can't say when she's confused or doesn't understand, and she can't trust others with her struggles. I guess those are all pretty much the same. The bottom line is every failure, weakness, and mistake she makes she hides. She has overwhelming shame and guilt about pretty much everything.  &amp;#x200B;  Can anyone please tell me it's not as bad as it seems and that medication and therapy will help her? Can I expect to have a normal life? When we got married I knew her as a woman that had some social anxiety and self esteem issues that made it hard for her to be brave and try new things, but now I realize it's the ADHD all along that's made things so hard for her. With the diagnosis it feels like a death sentence, things will never improve.
