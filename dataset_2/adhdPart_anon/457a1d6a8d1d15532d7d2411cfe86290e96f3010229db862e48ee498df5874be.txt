A dear friend of mine has ADHD and he’s medicated, it’s rather new for him (less than 2months). We study together and we always meet to révise now that we study online. He always want to maximise his work on med so he takes them only when he starts to study. Today he forgot, I noticed that he was being « weird », not concentrated, forgot to turn off the oven, to pour coffee. He was scrolling FB and not studying.  It was obvious that he forgot to take the meds but I didn’t want to tell him so he won’t be hurt.  He realized that he forgot too late and couldn’t study for the day, not only was he unproductive but also sad for not studying. I felt bad cause I could’ve avoided that and I also could’ve used some help studying myself haha  Do you tell your partners to take their meds openly? Aren’t you afraid to sound rush like « I don’t like this version of you, take some chemicals to change that »  I guess that’s how I would take it if it was me... I’ll be glad to read from you!
