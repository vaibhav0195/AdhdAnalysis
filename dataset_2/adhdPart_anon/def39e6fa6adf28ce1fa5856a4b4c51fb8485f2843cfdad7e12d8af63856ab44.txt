def39e6fa6adf28ce1fa5856a4b4c51fb8485f2843cfdad7e12d8af63856ab44;;;Husband (29dx) is so difficult to communicate with - because heâ€™s too good at it...;;;Sometimes I feel my husband is so focused and good at paying attention to details and facts, but so bad at empathy and reading situations, that it feels impossible to talk to him.   Heâ€˜ll remember exactly every word I said about something two weeks ago but wonâ€™t be able to pick up on anything subtle that might have indicated how i meant what I said.   He requires such clear communication from me... but i sometimes feel itâ€™s so hard, cause I canâ€™t always find the exact words and give a 1-10 priority rating with every statement and verbalize all my feelings.   But itâ€™s so so difficult to address this issue, cause him asking me to communicate clearly rationally seems like such a perfectly healthy thing to ask for. And I canâ€™t bring across my difficulty without having it sound like â€žI want you to read my mindâ€œ...   Does anyone have the same problems? Is it an ADHD thing? If so - Have you found solutions for this? Help ðŸ˜¢
def39e6fa6adf28ce1fa5856a4b4c51fb8485f2843cfdad7e12d8af63856ab44;;;What helps when they have that tunnel vision hyperfocus?;;;When he hyperfocuses my husband gets really impolite and dismissive to everything around him thatâ€™s not the thing heâ€™s focusing on. It can become a real problem and he doesnâ€™t like it but he doesnâ€™t know how to â€žsnap outâ€œ of this tunnelvision, no-empathy, nothing but this one thing matters -mode...  Any advice? Are there cognitive behavioral things he or I could do in those moments? Would meds help? Is it not possible to snap out of it at all and we just have to try minimizing damage?
def39e6fa6adf28ce1fa5856a4b4c51fb8485f2843cfdad7e12d8af63856ab44;;;Husband (DX) is sooo demanding;;;Sometimes it feels like my husband expects me to be a superhuman who doesnâ€™t have normal weaknesses, especially when it comes to his needs / expectations for our relationship (e.g. his sexual desires, me keeping promises i make exactly as i said 100%, keeping to our agreed savings strategy, maintaining a healthy diet)... to a point where i feel massive pressure...  and i am not sure how much or if at all that is ADHD related...  1) I feel like he focusses extremely on some of his needs and gets really emotional about them, getting super intense about it (outbursts, nightmares, desperation) ... often kind of either implicitly blaming me for not fulfilling them or blaming himself for needing them  2) He passive-aggressively makes me feel really pressured and stressed to be good enough, he doesnâ€™t consciously do it, but itâ€™s very real to me  3) he often lacks empathy to my situation and emotions in situations where i disappoint his expectations   Do you guys have experience with this sort of issues?
def39e6fa6adf28ce1fa5856a4b4c51fb8485f2843cfdad7e12d8af63856ab44;;;Shared Google Calendar not working out;;;My husband (DX) and I have a very active social life, so there needs to be a lot of planning ahead, like work schedules, us spending evenings or weekends with friends, doing stuff independently from each other and taking time for each other. My go-to idea was a shared google calendar, so weâ€™re both on the same page about whatâ€™s planned.  So... thatâ€™s not working...   Having a calendar is a massive pain for him and he just canâ€™t keep it up to date with his stuff. He himself remembers all appointments and dates etc by heart, but i just canâ€™t keep my schedule, his and ours in my head :(  How do you guys plan your shared life with your partners? Any ideas how to solve this?
