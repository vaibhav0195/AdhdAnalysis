e9c1c020831e87a5a78658abb2a1fa2a78665f369fc72b7eb44f557b0e6ca8b3;;;Advice needed: My ex with ADHD wants to make things work again and I'm not sure whether I should give him a chance;;;Me and my ex dated for 2 years and we had the most amazing relationship for the first year and things started getting worse. I would always try to talk to him about what bothered me and he said he would change and it never happened. He would constantly work, spend 500 dollars on jackets and shoes yet made excuses that he was broke and he stopped taking me out on nice dates.   I said we could do things that don't cost money and he continued making excuses saying he was tired and he didn't feel like it. He never wanted to do things I wanted to do and we were always in his room. He loves pushing my buttons and getting me upset because its cute but his jokes are always offensive and he makes me feel like im overreacting but if I did that to him he would lose it. Another issue is he only does things when its conveniant for him.  My ex would constantly say the word "n***" to make me upset and again he would make me feel like im getting mad over nothing. He said as long as he isn't saying it directly to someone then it doesn't matter and he even knows my cousin is black also..I also have a disorder called BPD and I've been taking my medications as well because I want to improve.   He on the other hand chose to get help and go on medications a month after we broke up and he wants to show that he will change. Will I be wasting my time if go back with him?
