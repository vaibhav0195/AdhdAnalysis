Trying to find the underlying cause.;;;I know only a doctor can truly make this diagnosis, but I suspect my partner has ADHD and I’m feeling a little lost on how to get help or if I’m completely misinterpreting the symptoms.  My husband and I have been together for 13 years, married for 7. I thought that his constant task switching, his go-go-go attitude and his difficulty coping with stress were just character traits, but now I’m wondering if these tendencies are ADHD related. The breaking point lately has been the irritability and mood swings. Some research suggests these heightened emotions are symptoms of ADHD, while others say that emotional outbursts are not hallmarks of ADHD.   I know there is not a one size fits all ADHD diagnosis, but do the symptoms below often fall in line with ADHD? Do you see these symptoms in your ADHD partner?  - Difficulty managing stress - Hyperfocus - Racing thoughts  - Constantly feeling compelled to start a new task - Waking up tired (as if racing thoughts did not stop while sleeping)  - Irritability  - Mood swings  - Always feeling tense  - Inability to stop (always in go-go-go mode)  Thank you for any help or advice that can be provided.
