Emotions run high in conflicts with our loved ones and it is all too easy to play the blame game and lash out at our partners.   &amp;#x200B;  [As many of us have come to realize - often it's not what you say to your ADHD partner, rather how you say it](https://i.redd.it/pj7gfnuu2tm31.png)  Practicing mindfulness and other DBT skills can improve communication for all parties involved

We all know that ADHD is an explanation, not an excuse. But many of us struggle to find the line between accommodating legitimate deficits and simply accepting disrespectful behavior.  A few examples of behavior that should never be tolerated might be:  * Violent outbursts * Name calling * Spending time on interests **instead** of time with partner (there has to be balance and compromise, hyperfocus is not an excuse for neglect) * Refusal to consider partner's needs and feelings once they have been clearly addressed * Deflection, projection, gaslighting, lying, triangulation etc * Refusal to implement available self-management tools i.e. timers, clocks, calendars, apps * Refusal of any treatment option ie medication, therapy, coaching, couples counselling and so on  Examples of areas where you could expect to make reasonable accommodations:  * Time management * Forgetfulness * Emotional lability  (note: not an excuse for emotional abuse) * Inattentiveness * Impulsivity   Here is where you decide what you will and will not accept &amp; what your needs in a relationship are  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/u3dkfoz6ej151.png?width=1057&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6fb189054ba59bff1956e590ccca3a0989d69dca  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/l3votc3bej151.png?width=1029&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cfb4af4ea513231c919e37bf3b80ff4aae04b17a  These excerpts are taken from [CHADD](https://chadd.org/attention-article/dont-give-up-dont-give-in-survival-skills-for-the-non-adhd-partner/) but there are plenty of other resources available on this subject. I think it would be useful for many non-ADHD partners to ask themselves "Would I tolerate this behavior from a neurotypical partner?". And "Why am I willing to tolerate the behavior simply because my partner has ADHD?" Many of us would face similar issues in any other relationship because we have not learned how to advocate for our own needs appropriately. Expectations for being treated with consideration, compassion and respect should not vary so greatly across NT or DX relationships.  If anyone finds this information helpful I may make a follow-up post highlighting what different boundaries can look like as well as learning how your own reactions/responses can be used as a powerful tool for creating the environment you want to have.
