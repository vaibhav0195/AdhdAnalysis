For a few years (maybe longer, I can't remember) I've been kind of thinking I'm showing symptoms of something, whether adhd or anxiety, or something similar. Neither of my parents have been diagnosed with anything, to my knowledge. They also would just think it was pretty dumb if I wanted to get tested for anything or go to therapy, but I'm going to be 18 in a few months, meaning I can go for myself without them necessarily knowing (besides if I used insurance, but I'll cross that bridge once I get there). I don't know if I should get tested or not though? Would the doctor just tell me what I wanted to hear, or would they tell me there's nothing wrong with me if they didn't think so? I just don't want to go in, and then just be told what I want to hear and then given some medication that will change me and my personality. I guess I'm just nervous about the whole thought of it. What is the process like? What do they evaluate? What would they say if I don't have anything wrong? I want to know why I think the way I do, but I don't want to be given anything unnecessary and, to be honest, I'm afraid of being diagnosed with something.
