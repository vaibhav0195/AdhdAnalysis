What can I do?;;;Hi all,  My wife has always had ADHD-like symptoms; terrible at: staying on top of bills, appointments, being on time, cleaning up after herself and getting too engrossed in something she enjoys (TV shows or her phone usually). However since our child came along 9 months ago, it has got much worse.  Aside from taking care of him (providing milk, changing his nappy, feeding him instant food through the day; she barely cooks) all she does is use Instagram. Sometimes 10 hours a day or more, checking on other recent mothers, pictures of their kids and keeping a log of how many followers they have day by day. She hasn't really done much around the house for 9 months and it's slowly getting too much for me to keep on top of after work. Until now I've been giving her the benefit of the doubt because I know raising a child is hard and I thought she may have a little post natal depression, but I just want something to change.  I'm fed up of nagging her to do more (cleaning, cooking, shopping etc) because it really isn't working. She laughs off my suggestions she may have ADHD and won't go to a hospital to check. I've sat her down and explained how much this is bothering me several times, and even when she agrees to try harder nothing changes. It doesn't help that we are living in Japan (she's Japanese) where ADHD and mental issues are much less recognised.  How can I get her to do more without constantly nagging? Are there any general suggestions or good books I can read to understand how to help her? Thank you.
