848a3e06fdcb2f7757149dc8906cc73988204c395f2d5b6ddc6c136c5fe1007e;;;Medication During Pandemic;;;My DX and medicated partner accidentally let his Rx lapse (a million factors: new online ordering, new insurance, pandemic, etc.) and now is looking at a week without medication. We're both really frustrated by this but I'm also really worried the withdrawal will be a problem. Does anyone use an online prescription service that actually works and doesn't suck and could potentially overnight or rush order? Ours is saying a week after letting us place a technically illegal order because we requested a 90 days supply.
