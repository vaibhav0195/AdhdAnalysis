035c8bb9ff18f94a023ca5aa3df68e694da686617943df25361f68d55f5f5376;;;Hi folks. Girlfriend recently 'diagnosed' with ADHD. Help me shift some perspective?;;;Hi folks.  My SO has always been forgetful and flighty. I'm not sure if it's gotten worse, or if over time I've just noticed it more, but over the past so many months it's been a source of super frustration for me. It's lead me to feel like her parent, and that's a nasty relationship dynamic to have. What used to be pretty cute and quirky is now just ... annoying. And unattractive, unfortunately...  We were having a talk and ADHD came up and about how she's never been officially diagnosed. A talk with her mom actually put that one to rest -- they knew she had ADHD as a kid and tried their best with what they had to accommodate. She's never been on medication for it, and has largely gone through life without giving it any thought at all ... until recently. She's talked to her therapist about it and is currently reading up on some literature (as am I), but that's about it at the moment.  Back to the aforementioned frustration, though. I need to get back to square one with her and the relationship, because at the moment I'm so heavily skewed towards feeling like some sort of parent/guardian. Making sure plans are known, constantly reminding her about things, having to clean up a ton, asking many times before getting answers -- list goes on. I've talked with her about many of these, and when nothing changes after a couple conversations I feel stuck between a) continuing my behavior and resenting her, or b) saying "fuck it" and allowing myself to get disappointed when inevitably the very thing I was worried would happen ... happens. I feel like either option just makes me remove myself even more and it's starting to feel just awful.  Any ideas?
