At the time the consensus was that my other mental health struggles were more important and the ADD was put on a back burner. Recently things have started improving to where my psychiatrist wants to start treating/focusing on it.   My partner (25M DX ADHD) hates this. I don’t know why. He insists I don’t actually have ADD which hurts because if anyone said that to him he would be extremely upset. He says I am too high functioning to be ADD. I am trying to tell him that not everyone has the same severity and that ADD in women can look really different.   Is there anything else I can do to reassure him that just because I have a similar issue I’m not “stealing” his diagnosis (to clarify i was diagnosed five years before I met him). I’m worried he’s going to be putting more pressure on himself because he’ll see me making lists and planning and he’s not able to do that. Any advice would be really appreciated.   TLDR: ADHD partner can’t and doesn’t seem to want to understand my ADD diagnosis.

I just got out of the hospital, extremely tired, and the Florida heat isn’t doing any favors. I ask before we leave if he’s checked they’re open, yes yes he’s checked. Halfway there I realize it’s Sunday and am suspicious they’re open. He checks for real and no, the shop is not open and I just walked a mile in pure humidity for nothing.   Got home and he told me he needs those second chances to tell the truth but that feels like he’s asking too much. I shouldn’t have to be okay with being mislead or lied to the first time like I’m talking to a five year old that hasn’t actually brushed their teeth. I don’t think it’s fair to even ask. He thinks I’m being unreasonable.   TLDR: Does anyone have any advice for the white lies they’re fed all the time? Any resources? Has therapy helped at all?
