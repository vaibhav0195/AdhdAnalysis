His body language turns aggresive and confronting, he raises his voice, moans at me or laughs at me. Sometimes copy what I say, or use immature phrases.  If I ask him if he is annoyed or angry with me, he will always with no exception, tell me he has never been more calm - while looking like a guy who wants to punch something. If I tell him he is coming off as angry, then all hell is lose, and he will start to purposely mock me in a bullying sense, like loudly laughing at me because Im so stupid.  He doesnt apologize for it, and even when he has actually calmed down, I dont think he has a sense of how its emotional abuse.   Is this emotional reaction normal with adhd? How am I supposed to handle it? He has asked me before to point it out when it happens, but when I do he becomes cruel.

He says he has a hard time with it and it doesnt come naturally to him.  Today I bought a game where there a small to big questions, I thought it would make it easier for us to have some of those conversation where we get to learn about eachother. But very quickly it was clear that he again would space out when I talked, and fast talk about himself, or focusing on the next card.  I dont know what to do anymore. Now he is on his computer again. I cant do it anymore. I dont know if this is adhd or just plain out narcissism.
