709ce1622a59ec22c9721b1fd8de1fc69c48cc7b1b3ae089c85a749ecac010dc;;;Wife of an ADHD Husband and feeling HOPELESS;;;Please help:  I knew my husband had ADHD before marrying him, but somehow I was able to look past all of that. Thankfully so because he is one of the greatest things that’s ever happened to me. But at the same time, the worst. I want to start off by saying he has not been on meds since early high school. We’re 21.   Since being married, my husband has gotten into 3 car accidents: totaling my very first car and wrecking the other one enough to where we are unable to afford the repairs at this moment but still drive-able. This morning I get a call from our insurance company inquiring about the accident that took place. Confused me goes, “the one from back in June?” She goes, “No? The one from last night.” So not only did my husband get into his THIRD car accident, he also neglected to tell me. On top of this, he has lost every debit card I’d ever owned since being married and has been fired from every job he’s ever had in the same amount of time. We got married last May. As you can imagine, I am emotionally, physically, and mentally sick of the back to back shenanigans.   We have seen a psychiatrist who referred us to a neuropsychologist so that we can get him back on meds. I guess my question is, what should I expect? Is it some kind of magic pill that’ll stop all of these problems? Or at least reduce them significantly? How can I be more understanding and helpful for him?  Thanks.
