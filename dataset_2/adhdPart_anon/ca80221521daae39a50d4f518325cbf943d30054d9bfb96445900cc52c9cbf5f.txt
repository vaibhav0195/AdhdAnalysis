ca80221521daae39a50d4f518325cbf943d30054d9bfb96445900cc52c9cbf5f;;;Just realized how much I spend on groceries;;;Just went over my expenses this month and found that I spent $800 on food between groceries/takeout/alcohol. I’m in shock. I prefer going shopping because my partner never remembers the things we need/I ask for and when I give him a list he still doesn’t go by it. It’s just easier to do it myself. I had no idea how much his ADD was literally costing me. He does shop sometimes and we take turns buying dinner but holy shit. We live together and his child from a previous marriage is with us half the time so we’re buying food for 2.5 people. If we were in theory paying equally for food we should NOT be spending $1600 a month. I want to ask to look at his expenses to see if we’re anywhere near equal. I’m scared of what I’ll find...
