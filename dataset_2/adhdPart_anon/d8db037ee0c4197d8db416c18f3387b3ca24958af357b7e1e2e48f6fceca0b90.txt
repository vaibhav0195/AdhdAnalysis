My husband has diagnosed ADHD and I have depression/anxiety...maybe we both have other stuff that’s undiagnosed(?) but anyway...when I am depressed I just can’t see the good in myself and feel anxious and hopeless about the future and I think I would like some emotional support from my husband, some words of encouragement, some advice...idk...just compassion and patience and kindness. Sometimes he really tries but he gets annoyed easily and if I disagree or am self deprecating he starts raising his voice and can make some mean/unhelpful comments...or like invalidate my feelings and just walks away and sometimes says things like “yeah I guess I am a horrible person” when I tell him how he is making me feel by acting that way.  I know it’s hard sometimes to deal with me but I just end up feeling so alone, like he gets emotionally detached and I have no one else to talk to that I feel would understand.  Another separate problem is that sometimes I get jealous of his ADHD diagnosis because at least he has a reason to be the way he is, and he was concrete tools, medicine and methods he can try to improve or help him, but I have a lot of the same issues ADHD people have, just don’t have ADHD so I feel like it’s all my fault and I am just a spoiled lazy brat who can rarely find motivation to do the most basic things and who is not passionate about many things and depend on my husband too much and so I partly get why he sometimes gets annoyed with me and maybe even resentful and when we fight the things he says sometimes are true, just said in a mean and hurtful way... Ok, rant over. Any advice would be appreciated. Feels nice to vent.
