ad988ff138cc659baebbd5d08edec3343001f1f981dfa146761896bc3ced0aac;;;Feeling like I can’t continue on with my DX significant other;;;Hi all,  I’m new here. My boyfriend (26) and I (24f) have been together for over 6 years. He was diagnosed as a child. Our issues are his sporadic ways, not be able to communicate well with me about his feelings and not putting my feeling and myself first in many situations. We have tried to work on these things in the past but I am feeling like we aren’t getting far. I feel like I’m grasping at straws because I don’t want to break up with him. But I was hoping maybe I could find some clarity from this sub. We both acknowledge his ADHD but he hasn’t tried to get any help because he doesn’t want to be put on meds and for the most part he is handling it okay. I personally don’t know much about ADHD besides the symptoms he deals with. What options would you suggest we look into? Any ways to cope that don’t involve meds I can suggest to him?   Thank you for your help and input, I appreciate it.
