All of my past relationships were really intense sexually &amp; I always felt desired. Now we don’t even kiss except to say goodbye sometimes, we barely touch at all. After 4 years of marriage our sex life doesn’t even exist anymore. At this point I feel like the sex/intimacy part of our relationship is dead &amp; I have a messy roommate or kid. There was some trauma in their past that caused issues around sex but it wasn’t like this in the beginning. Now I’m wondering if the ADHD is the really issue more than the past trauma. While it doesn’t seem to bother my spouse I feel like it makes me less close &amp; more agitated by the bad habits.
