He has done the washing, the first time I ask, washed dishes, gone to his appointments and to day we even got to eat out!  He also has OCD and was just diagnosed with aspergers, so you can imagine when I say things have never been easy.  But right now I feel so proud; he is on meds and I can actually recognise that he is trying his best.  Both to partners as well as afflicted; things do get better if you keep on trying. Communicate and love each other and always be honest; even when you haven't done the dishes or feel ashamed or belittled. I know that everything that for nt's can feel small, feels huge for you. Pat yourself on the back for getting up this morning, going to work or even just for being you. Praise be, honest to God. I love my boyfriend to death.

I am very confused to say the least, about how to actually deal with my partner. I feel like no matter what i say or do theres something wrong with it; either i said it in a wrong way or i acted irritated or the likes. He tells me what he dislikes (we have a great communication, despite), and then i follow through and that can even piss him off! I know ADHD makes you younger emotionally than your peers, and he does have some other diagnoses, i just dont know how to handle it. He isnt vey talkative about his emotions or his thoughts, and so i always end up feeling it was my fault we had an argument, even though it may have been about something he had said or done. I try to be understanding and follow along his wishes to the degree that it is possible, but it seems impossible to please him in this regard. He can seem rather cold and unfeeling when upset, which upsets me and escalates the situation further... How can i better myself?

I really thought that if I put in enough work and love, eventually we would learn to live together. We didn't, although we became good at communicating, it only emphasised how different and awful we were together. The night we broke up I could finally breathe. Every day I come home to my own apartment and I thank God he isn't there hammering me about what I do and say. I'm not saying that adhd relationships are impossible, but this one were. The feeling of leaving him behind is relief and new found joy in living - I'm no longer crying everyday or arguing, I simply exist with myself and I feel so at ease at last.
