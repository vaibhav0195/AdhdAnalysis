I have to remind him to be quiet 3+ times a night every night and usually I just give up. This used to just stress me out a little because I struggle with auditory processing and dislike loud environments but we live in a one bedroom apartment and just got a juvenile lizard whose enclosure is in our room. Our lizard is very young and very skittish, he scares from us looking at him for too long when he’s out, let alone shouting for hours around him when he’s trying to sleep.  We got into a fight yesterday because I told him he’s not improving at volume control despite me asking him to be conscious of it every night and I think I’m reasonably upset. He thinks I’m being unreasonable and believe that he’s simply not trying when actually he “can’t” control his volume and has always had this issue. I know it’s going to be different for every individual but both my younger and oldest siblings have ADD/ADHD, my little brother never had issues with volume control and my sister was able to manage it with medication so I don’t know if it’s really true that he can’t. I also just feel like his argument lacks empathy for both me and our pets by expecting us to just deal with it.  Has anyone here had any similar issues with volume control? Should I just believe him when he says he can’t or is there something more he/I/we can do?
