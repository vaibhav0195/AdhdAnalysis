408e0181a4ef7c368fe19e9f06214c93e1f40bf194e90a811357eb750913b4ae;;;Accountability;;;One of the biggest challenges in my relationship is listening to my partner shift blame and reasoning with negative outcomes onto things, objects, scenarios, circumstances etc when in reality, it is the individuals decisions that are entirely responsible for the repercussions. It is hard for people without this diagnosis, so I do feel for people with it - and how hard it must be. Does anyone have advice on ways to communicate this without offending someone with ADHD?
