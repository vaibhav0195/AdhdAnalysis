However after almost twenty years with my ADHD spouse I noticed that I'm more likely to lose my train of thought, organizing is becoming more difficult for me , I can't multitask anymore and when I am doing something I don't get intensely focused.. Anyone other NT partners notice this?  I've also noticed the same pattern with one of my siblings whose pouse and child both have ADHD. She just seems frazzled all the time, has difficulty making decisions, is always late, changes her mind frequently and then denies it oh, and has a hard time committing to anything. it may just be the stress of living with two ADHD people all the time. It's brought us closer together as frequently we will call each other up to commiserate or share methods or technology the help our loved ones stay on track. For example this past holiday season everyone received tiles from me as their Christmas gift.

It's becoming a huge problem because he continually needs more sleep and therefore nothing gets done around the house. I let  It go as long as possible then something happens like shit falls down and hits me or the dog, and that is my last straw and I either start throwing out all his stuff or launch angry tirade. I am not like this with any other person and I hate being this way. Bottom line is that his need for sleep trumps everything reading my personal safety and I can't get in to see it being a problem.  We are having a hard time finding a marriage counselor you also does ADHD. We both Strongly believe in a lifetime commitment but somethings gotta change or we living in separate places.
