They aren’t great at doing chores (washing up, cooking, laundry, etc.) and I want to help them get to a point where they can help more. Right now they do help out but I’d say it’s me doing 65% of the chores and I’d like to make it more 50/50.   I know people tend to think that it’s not good for the non-adhd partner to act as a parent but it actually works well for our dynamic. I really enjoy helping them improve themselves and when I help que them to do tasks and reward them, they feel better and in turn get more done and I enjoy it. In general I think I’ve always really liked caring for people and so this just feels like an extension of that. I give them positive reinforcement and make sure to remind them to eat, take breaks, clean, do their laundry, etc. and I’ve seen a *huge* improvement in their willingness to help out and it’s been a lasting change (they’ve consistently been helping out for months now!).   I’m wondering if anyone has any reward systems in place that they use with their partners, we have tried a reward chart but I often forget to fill it out and so they lose interest and it doesn’t end up helping much. I know they thrive on structure and I’m happy to help give that to them and in some ways I already do (we have a morning and night routine which really helps with their sleep and making sure they’re well rested) but I think a little more would be the push they need to get it to a 50/50 split in terms of chores.   Also, does anyone have any links to resources where I can learn more about the effects of ADHD? I know the general idea that it makes it harder to focus and get things done but I want to know more about the other impacts so that I can help them and better understand what they’re going through.
