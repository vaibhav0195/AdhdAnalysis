Her health has improved, we are able to do more physical activities which is great and she's less likely to die a terrible death from cancer (all good things!)  However, I've noticed there has been an increase of ADHD symptoms since she quit that neither of us had thought about or prepared for.   Has anyone experienced similar and found any solutions?    My partner used medication growing up but due to side effects as a teen, is very hesitant to use any now. It's been about 2 years since she quit smoking so I don't think withdrawal is having an impact at this point but I could be wrong.   I do think she used smoking to escape anxiety inducing situations and give herself a break so replacement strategies may help that aspect.
