Since the age of about 23ish he hasn't been taking it consistently. By that I mean he doesn't get his prescription filled, and quit going to doctors appointments...eventually his doctor wouldn't take him anymore and he's refused to go see another doctor because it's "too much work and anxiety" (which I get, because I'm diagnosed with BPD2, however I maintain my medication regimen because I know what it is to feel like shit and what it is to have quality of life. But I'm getting off topic) The last 2-4 years I've noticed a dramatic change in his personality. When I go over to hang out all we do is lay in his bed and watch Netflix, get high, and drink wine because that's all he wants to do. If I ask him to go grab a bite to eat, we can't go inside anywhere (before Covid) because he "can't be seen" and he lashes out on me for the most minuscule things.  I've obviously noticed the anger, irritability, anxiety, and mood swings.  I have tried my best to offer help in the form of aiding in finding him a doctor or a therapist, or just listening and being there, but he constantly refuses and it's like everything I do is wrong, he ends up mad at me, yells at me, and I end up going home feeling bad for weeks about how my dearest friend is going down this rabbit hole that I cant seem to help him out of. My question is what do I do?? Do I support him even though every time I see him I feel like I walk on eggshells? I've made it crystal clear that whenever he wants help, I'll be here. I dont have ADHD, I've never taken adderall, and I'm terribly afraid he's going off the mental illness "deep end".   TLDR; bestie has been on and off adderal for about 7 years. Very angry and full of anxiety. Takes it out on me. Where do I go from here with him?
