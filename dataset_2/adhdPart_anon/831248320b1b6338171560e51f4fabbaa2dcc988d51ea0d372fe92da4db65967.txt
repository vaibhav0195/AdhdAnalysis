He had MONTHS to try and figure it out. Months. I repeatedly reminded him and asked him if we (not him) could "look into that thing this week". Every week, I'd get the same response, some kind of excuse, and half-assed reassurance that "yes, I'm gonna do it this week". It never happened.  We are now a few days out and obviously ran out of time. On top of that, we have found out that this service is going to cost WAY MORE than we had expected. Which has put us in a very stressful situation.  Anyway, I don't know how to cope. I am very angry for it having taken so long, and that now that's it *do or die* we're left with barely any choices and all this unnecessary stress simply because he chose to postpone his duties.  I understand that it's hard for ADHD sufferers to get things done and such, but come on. This not only affects him, but our entire future as well.  How can I let go of the anger and be there to support him in these difficult times? I'm finding it very hard.  Has anyone been in a similar situation before?  TIA
