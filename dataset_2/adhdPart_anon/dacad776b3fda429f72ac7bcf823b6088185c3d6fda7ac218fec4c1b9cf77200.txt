They sent us each a form to fill out with an envelope. Weeks later I asked if they had gotten back to her but she had lost the form. No problem, I called and had them send another one.   More weeks pass and I call them to see if they'd gotten the forms, but they said they hadn't been keyed in yet, call back in a week. Another week passes and I call back again, and now that it's keyed in they're saying that due to COVID they have a six-month backlog of interviews before getting an appointment, call back then if we don't hear from them in six months.  I'm NT and the whole process was difficult for me, let alone a person struggling with ADHD. It's ridiculous that they would have a multi-step process which requires so much executive function to make an ADHD appointment. It's like only having stairs at the paraplegic clinic, or putting all your braille signs on the ceiling.  Can anyone provide a reasonable explanation for why this process is so difficult?
