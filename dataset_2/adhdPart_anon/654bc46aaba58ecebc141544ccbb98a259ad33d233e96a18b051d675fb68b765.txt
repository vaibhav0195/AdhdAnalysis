654bc46aaba58ecebc141544ccbb98a259ad33d233e96a18b051d675fb68b765;;;Some Positives;;;I'm personally here becauss I'm diagnosed with ADHD-C and noticed a lot of negative posts here which is really concerning and I can only hope my fianc√© doesn't go through this much just because of my condition. I feel like it's mostly negative because people need to rant about some struggles that they're going through, which is fair. Everybody needs to rant from time to time. But it's also good to talk about the good.  I saw a post on here a little while back and I believe this should be something talked about more often. People tend to only talk about the bads in life, but what are some things you like about your partner's ADHD. And if you're the one with ADHD with a non-ADHD partner, how have they helped you in your journey through this illness?  I'll start it off in the comments   PS: The flair I put is the closest to what I think this post is about, but it doesn't fit very well. Sorry about that...
