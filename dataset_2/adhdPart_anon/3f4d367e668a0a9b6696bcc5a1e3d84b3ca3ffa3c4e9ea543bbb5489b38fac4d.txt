Video Call Consultation?  #   # NOTE: This is not a sourcing post or asking for any advice illegal activities. It is only me voicing out the desperation of the best cure for me that is overly regulated.  ^(My post was already deleted from) r/ADHD ^(for asking about how to legally have it in my country, which is possible but difficult.)  &amp;#x200B;  This post is not about my partner, but my very close sibling that I would love to help him out to live healthily, happily and productively.   &amp;#x200B;  I have been diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety and social anxiety. I have been medicated by Vyvanse in addiction to being on-and-off different SSRI's and SNRI's and some occasional intake of Propanolol/Diazepam for social/panicky situations.  I am an expat in Australia and I am about to leave the country for good, going back to where Vyvanse is unapproved as an ADD/ADHD medication. I have managed to obtain a year's supply of it for myself to bring with me back home (the Middle East, Gulf countries region).  &amp;#x200B;  * ***Now***, this post is mainly is about inquiring about a way for my brother, who has ADD and similar symptoms and has undergone Atomoxetine treatment which did not suit him, and I thought Lisdexamphetamine would be highly beneficial for him as it went very well for symptoms which are similar to him.  The main issue here is how to get it prescribed to him from a doctor overseas in one of the countries that have it approved. I tried speaking to few psychiatrists in here of different states who offer video calls consultations but won't prescribe a scheduled substance to a person abroad, even with an endorsement letter of his local psychiatrist, and I was told the patient needs to reside in the same state as the doctor, as per Australian guidelines. It is importation if it was prescribed, being purchased online, should not be an issue with our regional customs if the paperwork for clearance were followed accordingly, that if it was successfully prescribed to him.  &amp;#x200B;  I even have had desperately entertained the thought of posing as him and see a doctor to get a prescription, but I would not take the risk of doing this.  Or as a last resort, for him to travel to one of these countries and obtain it there, which would be painful, especially a doctor will not prescribe repeat scripts until a month trial at least, that, and the costly travel expenses in addition to the high cost of Vyvanse itself.  &amp;#x200B;  *I am sure many in this community or elsewhere are in a similar boat, if any soul in here have any helpful idea, experience, or opinion for this situation please do have your input.  It would be highly appreciated as his wellbeing is important to mine and he has been through a lot lately.*   &amp;#x200B;  |***Summary of worldwide marketing authorization status (updated 31 July 2013)***\*| |:-|   &amp;#x200B;  |*Country*|*Trade Name*|*Status*| |:-|:-|:-| |**Australia**|VYVANSE|Approved| |**Brazil**|VENVANSE|Approved| |**Canada**|VYVANSE|Approved| |**Denmark**|ELVANSE|Approved| |**Finland**|ELVANSE|Approved| |**Germany**|ELVANSE|Approved| |**Ireland**|ELVANSE|Approved| |**Norway**|TYVANSE|Approved| |**Spain**|ELVANSE|Approved| |**Sweden**|ELVANSE|Approved| |**United Kingdom**|ELVANSE|Approved| |**United States**|VYVANSE|Approved| |**Total**|***Approved in 12 countries***||  * **\*** [WHO's reference on Lisdexamphetamine](https://www.who.int/medicines/areas/quality_safety/5_1_Prereview.pdf)  &amp;#x200B;  Over almost a year now and Vyvanse been the most effective medication to treat these issues, and I have been on Dexamphetamine and Ritalin before and did not find it practical enough in treating my symptoms given its short half-life and the compulsive need to redose that comes with it, and potentially the abuse potential I have had fallen in.  It is a shame it is still highly restricted in most of the world because of its parent compound even with its low potential for abuse, rather than being regulated monitored as properly.
