I feel like a million bucks if I get to bed by 830. Every night, I head upstairs around 815, but I never get to sleep before 1000 because as soon as the sun starts to go down, it’s like someone gave him speed. *The sun sets after 915 most nights in the summer where we live and it’s still light out at 1000, sometimes later* He starts turning on all of the lights and getting hyped up like a child who doesn’t want to go to bed because they may miss something. I’m not kidding, it’s 945 now and he’s downstairs signing the wrong lyrics to random 60’s songs cracking himself up. When he’s switching songs, he’ll pause and yell something up the stairs to me. 95% of the time, I think this is hilarious because he’s having such a good time being himself. 5% of the time I’m cranky and haven’t had enough sleep all week and I may choke him if he doesn’t shut up.   Anyone else experience this?
