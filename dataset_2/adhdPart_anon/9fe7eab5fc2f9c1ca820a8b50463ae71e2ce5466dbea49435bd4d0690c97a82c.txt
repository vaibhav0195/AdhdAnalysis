My ADHD wife had to run to the store for something and we kissed goodbye in the kitchen while I was making dinner. Our oldest son was helping me. A little while later my wife texts me:  &gt;	No making out in the kitchen without me  Huh? With who? Our son? Oh, I get it. It’s a random thought that was blurted out. She does these weird things sometimes.  \#adhdpartnerslife
