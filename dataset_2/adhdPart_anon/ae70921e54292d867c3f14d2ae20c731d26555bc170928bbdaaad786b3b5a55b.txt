ae70921e54292d867c3f14d2ae20c731d26555bc170928bbdaaad786b3b5a55b;;;tl;dr Saturday was hell, Sunday was heaven. Both days were worth it.;;;I joined this page about a week ago because I was overwhelmed in a new relationship and looking for support/advice on how to be a better partner. I didn't really get what I came for, so I'm posting.  I've been dating someone for &lt;6 mos. and it's been challenging. There are days where I take everything personally and I get pissed off and overwhelmed. My Partner has had panic attacks, been hours late to important functions, forgotten their meds, battled with addiction.  But there are days that have been beautiful. Most of them are. We laugh, we eat good food, we watch our favorite shows, we walk the dogs, we tackle projects around our respective homes together.  The BIGGEST THINGS that have helped are 1. I have stopped taking things personally and understand that they are NOT doing things to upset me or because they don't care and 2. education is KEY to understanding. ASK how you can help them and LISTEN to their answer. Everyone is different and you can make their life (and your life) more pleasant and joyful by increasing your empathy and understanding.   All that said, ADHD is very new to my life and I would appreciate any advice for those in long-term relationships on how to best be supportive and still be independant. Our biggest struggles are time management and self-worth. Thanks for listening.
