Advice on how to manage dopamine drops or support steady levels?  They’ve only had ADHD dx the past ~2 yrs, so we’re still learning a lot about how it shows up, along with continued CPTSD healing. Was on ADHD medication for a while but it exacerbated their anger/trauma sensitivity as it wore off in evenings (complicated med hx broadly). They’ve been trying to manage daytime stimulation needs with coffee recently but work has been hard (might be another advice post soon...) TBH I could also use some resources recs for adult ADHD/supporting partner with ADHD.   Note: I just joined Reddit tonight after another disconnect and drop from my partner. I’ve been feeling so lonely the past few months especially in dealing with how high the level of ADHD/trauma symptoms have been. It’s always been hard for me to connect with folks online/by text vs in person, but I need some sort of support community. Hoping this sub provides that space!
