dde478eb372ac8eba046a42254605cdbf34380088f82609eeadb3e9872af3de6;;;I (32/m) am in a LTR with an untreated ADHD partner (41/m);;;The world is a funny place. In the past two years, I've gone from a closeted bi male to being in a long term relationship with a kind and loving person. However, we all have our monsters and baggage. I have PTSD from sex abuse. He has ADHD. Our monsters like to get each other worked up.  I went to therapy and am undergoing treatment. He has been self managed all his life. There are some struggles that I am having and I was wondering if someone on here either has had similar experience or if they've figured out something.  I need a way of being supportive without being condescending.   I need a way of expressing my needs without nagging.  I need a way of making a list of tasks without being critical.   I understand that being critical, condescending, or demeaning is never okay, but like many others this is how I have resorted to in order to get his attention.
