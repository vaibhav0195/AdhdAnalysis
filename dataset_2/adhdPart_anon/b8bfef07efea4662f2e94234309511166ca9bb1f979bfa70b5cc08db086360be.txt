I need help with my SO;;;   Hi all,  I  (38F) don't have adhd, but the man I've been seeing (36M) is since  summer does. I care for him quite a bit so I have read up heavily on  ADHD and how I should respond.  He is a beautiful person under the  outbursts and forgetfulness and I want the best for him and I.  I'm  asking you all because I know other subreddits will just scream at me  to dump him and I'd rather learn if anything I can do different can help  first.  He  is not medicated (refuses) and self medicates, while I don't agree with  this, it is not something I think he is willing to give up as of yet, I  do think he'd be open to it someday. He has had a beyond difficult week  and while it's always been clear to me hes sensitive **his latest behavior has been to start fabricating lies.**  He's  always "embellished" stories but lately everything wrong in his life is  my fault and when I explain how it isn't calmly and patiently but  firmly (**it isn't AT ALL, sometimes I'm not even present**)  he then will fabricated a story that involved me saying or doing  something (that didn't happen) to then make it look like my fault. When  we first started going out he would blame me if he lost his things, was  late etc.  Sometime with quite a bit of anger. Things I have zero  control over. I did a mix of firm "yeah not my fault" and ignoring and  he stopped for the most part after a few weeks.  So  lately the blame has gotten much more elaborate and the fabrications  border fantasy. They now involve me saying and doing things I have  couldn't have even done. So far I've just done full non response, or  saying firmly that didn't happen and dropping it, etc.  However the new  thing is If I drop it he will bring it up over and over fishing for a  reaction.  I've now hit a point  where he's stacking these fabricated events together, and is now  paranoid inventing things that did even remotely occur. I'm guessing hes  either trying to sabotage this (I"m the first stable person hes dated  ever) or hes so sensitive to rejection hes trying to make himself feel  better.  Needless to say I'm  concerned. Is this a response to the very stressful event/fear I'll  leave him if he somehow admits his bad behavior etc?  Is ignoring this  the best response? Lying is dealbreaker for me, but I can't help but  feel like this is something more pathological/painful coming from a  different place than normal deception.  I  feel there is so little out there about the best way to respond (to  adhd in general) or its geared towards parenting. I'm saddened that the  common advice is just to leave.  Help.
