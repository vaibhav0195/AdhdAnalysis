He (25) and I (24) have had an incredibly rocky marriage from the very first day we were married. There was a lot of pressure for us to get married quick. I was not ready. But he insisted and one day said it was now or never. we went to a court house and got hitched. No family... no loved ones. I knew I didn’t want to do it, but I did it anyways. Cause I thought he would leave me if I didn’t marry him (young and dumb). The ADHD has played a significant roll in this ending. And that makes me feel like the devil. I couldn’t stick around because I couldn’t handle his disability? How horrible is that ? We were at our breaking point in the beginning of this year. That’s when he decided to get medication and to treat his ADHD. It helped him a little bit. He has a pretty high dosage. I tried to force him to eat through the whole process, he just wouldn’t eat. He lost 40 pounds in 3 months. He would have episodes of anger and being pissed off for no reason. Even though he was medicated he was barley able to do the bare minimum (if that) I love him. I really do. That’s why I’ve been with him the years that I have. I just know he’s giving his 100% right now. And it sounds messed up... but it’s not good enough for me. It still leaves me feeling like I am picking up most of the slack. I still need to drag him to do things. I still have to beg for his help. It sucks it really does. I just want an equal partner... and this whole marriage has drained me. I feel like I am the mother to a teenage boy. I just can’t anymore... how do I rid myself of all of this guilt ? Makes me sick of myself... I hate it. I just can’t do it.
