(Also non-native English speaker... Sorry for low readability!)   I started dating my boyfriend about four months ago, and on several occasions I witnessed him taking medicine. He didn't tell me what the medicine was the first time, and the second time he hesitantly told me he might have ADHD, got diagnosed once and since then he's been ordering the same medicine online as it makes him calm. I didn't think that was a huge deal back then and I forgot about it.  Lately I noticed his behaviors became a bit odd, like cancelling dates in the last minute and ignoring my texts for a few days. Whenever I asked him what was wrong, he always said he was to blame and he promised to change. I believed him because he was so sincere every time. But after many honest discussions, his behaviors have not changed.  Then I started to wonder if some of the issues are caused by ADHD.  But I am afraid he does not want to openly discuss ADHD with me, given that he was hesitant to tell me in the first place. Also I do not want to hurt him in any way.  How should I start the conversation? Any advice would be appreciated.  Thanks so much for reading!
