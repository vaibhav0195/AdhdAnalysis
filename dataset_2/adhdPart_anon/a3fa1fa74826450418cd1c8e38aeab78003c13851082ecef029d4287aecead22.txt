After an ultimatum that he gets anger management or a divorce (I now know this was very wrong) he started going to therapy and was prescribed Zoloft three years ago for depression and suicidal ideologies. The Zoloft helped and we even had successful marriage counseling. Recently he researched ADHD, took tests, and got a psychiatrist diagnosis for ADHD along with an Adderall (not sure the exact rx) prescription.   His first day on Adderall he said he felt great during work, could actually focus, and remember things. Day two he had drug induced appetite suppression which caused a meltdown after I asked him to just save his supper for later and not throw it away. Fast forward to day 6 and we had late night plans for a Christmas event that we needed to get dinner prior to. He took my normal dinner conversation that we have every other night as me wanting him to cook or choose and had a screaming crying fit about how he just wants to come home and relax which lasted an hour and half. Now today Day 7 another melt down because I asked him several times to take care of the dog’s barking but he decided to do other ADHD distractions each time he said he’d take care of it. So when I started to get up to take care of the dog myself he screamed and yelled that the dog is fine and I need to quit micromanaging him all the time, everything he does I micromanage and he can’t do anything right. During these meltdowns he will say hurt things and say that I should just divorce him if that’s what I want even though I haven’t said that since the first and last time.  His meltdowns were far less on Zoloft and I thought we were starting to really work on our marriage using tips from marriage counseling. Is this just an adjustment period or am I in for a lifetime of daily meltdowns?
