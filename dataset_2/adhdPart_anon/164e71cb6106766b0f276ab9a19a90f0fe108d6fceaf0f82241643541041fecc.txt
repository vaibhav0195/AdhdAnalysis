If I paraphrase using different words than she used, she accuses me of gaslighting her or of making things up.   She tells me I don’t listen to her or hear her, but I don’t feel listened to or heard either.   She tells me we need to talk to work things out, then stonewalls me when we’re finally in the same room.  She tells me she’s too upset with me to work. Meanwhile, the bills keep piling up.  She says we should go out, do something fun for once. Then the next day, she tells me she doesn’t feel like it anymore.   To make things work, the solution seems simple: I’ve gotta stop having opinions, feelings, or perspectives that don’t match hers.  winning is pain. Could it be that I’m just an accessory to her?
