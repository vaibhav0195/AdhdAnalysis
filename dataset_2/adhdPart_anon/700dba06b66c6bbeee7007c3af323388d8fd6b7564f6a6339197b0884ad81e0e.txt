This is all fine and good if you have someone else pulling their weight. What do you do if you don’t have that option, and outside help isn’t an option because of the pandemic and immunocompromised children?  Our division of responsibilities:  Me - earn the money (able to work remotely, thankfully) - manage finances - manage medical care and insurance - grocery shopping, cooking all meals and dishes/cleanup - housekeeping (except the bathrooms, which we have our older kids starting to manage—such a relief) - clothes shopping and laundry with the kids  Her - Supervise kids while they do online school - Supervise kids during the time between when they finish school and I finish work - our laundry, which sometimes gets finished by the end of day 2 without my help - manage her ADHD, anxiety and depression with medication and regular therapy   I’ve laid this out for her before and talked about how it’s killing me. She offers to take on more, then doesn’t actually take care of it, and then I get to play catch-up on the stuff she’s neglected. If I push her on why she didn’t take care of it, she spirals and blames my unrealistic expectations. I don’t know how many more times I can take this “you should take care of yourself first” conversation without absolutely losing my shit. I know her brain is unkind to her, but a little recognition of her own part in my overwhelming workload would go a long way.
