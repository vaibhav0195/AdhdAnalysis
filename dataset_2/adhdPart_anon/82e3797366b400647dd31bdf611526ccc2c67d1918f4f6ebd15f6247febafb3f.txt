Imagine being them. It must be so hard when they can’t think straight or sleep when they want to or do anything they WANT to do because their mind won’t let them.   This post has no real purpose other than to maybe give us all some perspective cause it’s all too easy to pitty ourselves as the partner when we aren’t the ones that have to fight ourselves everyday.   I’m so proud of my partner. He’s amazing. He is so kind and sweet. I know he’ll probably read this so I just wanted to let you know that I can only try to understand how hard it is and I’m sorry it’s so hard to be you but you’ve got me too.   Hope this helps anyone struggling.

He’s looking into it but apparently it’s expensive.   He’s had CBT before and it’s didn’t work also as someone who is technical science minded he doubts “talking about it” can help his mental state. Could anyone elaborate on the therapy they or their partners have had?  Specifically to do with past trauma or self esteem as well?
