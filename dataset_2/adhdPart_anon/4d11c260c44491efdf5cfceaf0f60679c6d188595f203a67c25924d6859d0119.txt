Full disclosure - I'm a long term redditor who created this account to join this sub and ask questions, read and learn from your experiences. There are reasons I wanted a throwaway for this, which we can chat about later.   We're married, and have spent the first half of time in our relationship really, truly enjoying each others company and interests. I knew he was DX when we first started dating, and even when difficulties with his ADHD started to show, I thought that this was just part of the challenge, and that I was doing the right thing by staying and supporting him.   I have struggled since marriage, realizing that maybe the things I dont necessarily love are just 'him' and not 'ADHD' as he so often says. I feel a lot of guilt even saying things like that - should I not love all aspects of him? even the ADHD? However, any time there is a struggle - he forgets things, shuts me out, hyperfocuses on details for days... when I talk to him about it he does a defensive 'well, its my ADHD' thing.  A girl at work today told me that her ex-partner had adhd and that his medication really helped with his symptoms. My husband takes medication every day, for almost 15 years, and while I recognize the marked difference if he doesnt take the meds (he's a complete asshole if he's off meds), I dont know that the meds actual help the management of his day to day.   I'm on the edge. The Edge, the edge.  Looking for insight, support, anything. I question every decision I make every day, if I'm making things better or worse. We're under a lot of stress with our careers, covid, and have also been trying to have a baby for the past year (and are starting fertility treatments).
