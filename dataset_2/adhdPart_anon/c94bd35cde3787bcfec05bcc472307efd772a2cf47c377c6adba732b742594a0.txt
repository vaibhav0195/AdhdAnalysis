She was diagnosed as a teen and refuses to believe that she has it. She blames it on her neglected upbringing. Admittedly, she was very neglected. There’s a lot of trauma from her childhood that she refuses to deal with. But I know her father. There is no way he would ever be able to talk a doctor into giving a fake diagnosis like that. And at the time, a girl being diagnosed was almost unheard of. When I bring up that she probably does have it and that we should address it. She completely shuts down and refuses to even talk about. She said it hurt her that I would think that about her   My response was ‘get over it, that’s what you tell me to do’ She brought it up that I would told her that 6 weeks ago, it was two but that’s not the point.   I feel bad about telling her that. But also, I meant it.  I don’t want to play by different rules that I have to just deal with her lack of impulse control, and her neglectfully meandering though life. While I pick up the pieces behind her.   What have you said you feel about about but it was true.
c94bd35cde3787bcfec05bcc472307efd772a2cf47c377c6adba732b742594a0;;;How many of you have a female ADHD partner?;;;I joined this sub a long time ago and only occasionally read though it. I can sympathize with a lot of you in here and your struggles with your partner. But I’m not seeing a whole lot of people who have a female AHDH partner. I know it’s under diagnosed in women and even then it’s hard for most of them to accept. But the behaviors are so different I’m finding it hard to get much information or  resources on the topic.  We were having a lot of problems before Covid and only starting to work on looking for a new marriage counselor (we have had 3 different ones, the first two didn’t pick up on it and the third had zero idea how to handle any sort of therapy and was just charging us for what felt like essentially talking to your moms friend who took a psych course in college). Now marriage counseling is almost impossible to find and those that have any background in ADHD are solidly booked. We have been on a waiting list for 5 months now.  Idk. I’m just looking for some support and that’s probably why I’m posting here. Any advice?

She is adamant that she doesn’t have it, Medication did nothing. That even talking about it is attacking her. How can we move forward when she can’t admit that there’s a problem. And if she’s not going to let the problem be ADHD then all that behavior is selfish, impulsive, short sighted, destructive behavior.
