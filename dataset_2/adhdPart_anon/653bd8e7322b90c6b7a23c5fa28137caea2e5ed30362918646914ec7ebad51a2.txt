653bd8e7322b90c6b7a23c5fa28137caea2e5ed30362918646914ec7ebad51a2;;;My intimate life is being affected by my SO’s ADHD;;;I’ve realized the more I (F 27) got to know my partner (M 30) of 2 years, the more stale our sex life has become.  It’s like bf has a difficult time exuding that passionate, serious, seductive, all around just freaking hot assertive MAN attitude in bed.. you know what I mean??  [gonna be kinda personal / graphic here lol]  My bf is absolutely the greatest guy I ever met, I’m still attracted to him, we’re an excellent pair Etc.   We still have sex but not as often. Maybe 3-4x a month. I’ve realized I find him quite irritating and get turned off by his energy sometimes :(   Plus he’s super vanilla about sex... (for other reasons than adhd and some past trauma as well...) I’m fairly vanilla with a few kinks, but again, I really enjoy a dominant man and intense seduction. I’ve expressed this to him and it’s gotten sort of awkward a few times when we tried what I had in mind. It felt fake.   And the ways I try explaining my wants to him is confusing. He doesn’t comprehend that I don’t thinks it’s hot when he usually just tries “babe you’re so sexy” *gently rubs or squeezes me* “I’m in the mood if you are”   sometimes he’ll “jokingly” dry-grind up on me when I’m doing dishes or going about the house. Or he will straight up say “god I’m horny” or “mmm you’ve got me hard” out of nowhere (once he said it at my cousins wedding when I was just standing at the bar ordering a drink for my mom. HUH?)   it just seems SO immature &amp; out of context to me it’s honestly annoying. I’ve told him and even argued w him about it. He still jokes like this sometimes though. It just turns me off...  We both love sex but idk, I  often feel like he’s a fucking 17 year old still when it comes to physical intimacy.   Good news is he lasts a veryyyyyy long time in bed and always intends to satisfy me to the end. He usually gets me off about 80% the time.. When we actually do have sex. For this I’m SUPER grateful. I just feel scared i don’t feel like boning as much anymore.    I don’t know what to do about this really. I’m not getting any younger lol and I want to feel excited and passionate when it comes to sex. Doesn’t have to be perfect, and I know I can’t change him.   But with my exes I was a FRRRREAK you guys and so were they lol it was so much fun. With my bf, he doesn’t seem to get it. He doesn’t enjoy receiving head (but he loves to give so that’s amazing). He thinks watching porn together would be awkward and he’s intimidated by bondage (both my biggest kinks) WHICH IS WEIRD, considering he’s such an affectionate spazz 90% the time in daily life! Lol   SIGH I’m wondering if there are ways I can get him to understand my desire for a little more, ermmm, “feral” vibes in the bedroom lol??? And less pervy turn-off vibes at random moments. I know he loves me and wants me to be happy, but how do I get him to explore my sexual fantasies more in a way that works for BOTH of us?   Anyone else? Am I being too picky; should I just stick to what I’ve got and enjoy the orgasms albeit somewhat boring?? Am I being too unrealistic with his ADHD and spazzing, streamlined approach? Advice? 😭
