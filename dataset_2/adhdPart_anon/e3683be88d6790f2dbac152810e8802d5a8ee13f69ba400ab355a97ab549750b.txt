e3683be88d6790f2dbac152810e8802d5a8ee13f69ba400ab355a97ab549750b;;;book or article recommendations;;;i'm almost finished reading The ADHD Affect on Marriage and am finding I (the adhd partner) relate more to the non-adhd person often described in the book.  In the book, the non-adhd person picks up all the slack, does more than their share, has everything shoved in their direction, is expected to take the lead on everthing and make sure all the moving parts keep moving. Because I am a stay at home mom, its been accepted that all this stuff should fall to me. As I am reading along all I can think is, if the non-adhd person in the relationship feels overwhelmed by having to take on all this responsibility, imagine being in the same position but having adhd. I constantly feel like I'm drowning and I have started the dialog with my spouse about it, but we need more. i am going to ask him to read the book, because surely there are many challenges he faces being married to me, and the book does a good job recognizing the struggles of the non-adhd partner. But man, I sure would like to find something that illustrates the challenges adhd partners face because of their non-adhd partner behaviors and responses. If anyone has and books, articles, etc i would appreciate you sharing your recommendations.
