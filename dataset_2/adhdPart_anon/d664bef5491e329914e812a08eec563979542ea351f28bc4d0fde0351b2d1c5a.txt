But for all intents and purposes, it seems like he probably does have ADHD (he's scheduled for formal testing next month), especially since things have been slightly worse since he got off the meds he was on (I can't remember what they were atm).  Anyway. I get SO frustrated because he rarely contributes around the house. I try not to accuse/blame, but for example. This weekend he said he would do 2 chores. I trusted him to get those chores done and didn't bother him about them even though I was cleaning all Saturday afternoon and he was watching a movie. Then on Sunday I had to be the nagging wife and keep reminding him to do them and he would get upset because he wants to do things on his own time. The problem is, if I don't remind him it just won't get done. He ultimately only did 1 of the 2 chores he said he would do and so I'm going to have to do chore #2 after work today.   On top of this- he doesn't clean up after himself. I spend at least 10 minutes of my day going around our apartment picking up cups, throwing away food packaging, and putting dishes in the dishwasher, because he just...doesn't. I've brought this up to him so many times and again, he says he wants to do it on his own time.   I try to be patient, but it's extremely frustrating. I guess I'm looking for advice on how to deal with this/ support if anyone goes through the same thing? And I hope I'm not coming off as a jerk, I'm just kinda at my wit's end here.
