We live with his father and have an 18 month old son. I go to school full-time, work a government desk job part-time, and seem to be solely in charge of running this household.   I have done my very best to understand his condition. I've done everything I can think of. I've read the books, downloaded the podcasts, watched the videos, everything I can think of, all the while taking diligent notes and brainstorming how we might apply the suggested solutions to our own lives. But to absolutely no avail.   I've swung from totally detached, "let him fail", all the way over to absolutely running myself into the ground by just doing everything myself. In the past I've done so well with being patient and empathetic and never, ever losing my temper. But lately I find myself snapping, begging him through sheets and sheets of tears to "please just wake up and HELP ME."   It can't continue like this. It can't. He doesn't pick up after himself. He doesn't make or remember appointments. He doesn't get out of bed without hours of coaxing from me, and even then he still spends most of the day napping on the couch. Then it's video games until 4am, and the cycle repeats. I do all of our laundry, all of our cleaning, the overwhelming majority of childcare, all at the expense of my own health, wants, needs, and goals. I've already dropped out of a class because the demands he places on me are just so extreme.   Please, offer me some support/advice/suggestions. I KNOW that this is a neurobiological disorder, and that my partner is not lazy and spiteful and does actually love me, but oh my god I cannot feel that anymore. I do not feel anything other than stressed and angry and overwhelmed.
