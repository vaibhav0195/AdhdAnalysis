2d2c92fa04b06dd1b12c6ab208278e70515f41e244a66b5c7c7fbfd16e9b1a05;;;Advice about prodding?;;;So, the way my partner is, if he needs to do something (like get in the shower by 6, or leave for the store by 9, etc), I can tell him... and I remind him. But it is always me, prodding him for ages to get out of bed, or leave for the store. At some point (maybe around 5 reminders, and a time delay) it is nagging... which I hate to do. It stresses me out, it makes me crazy. And he’s not much of a fan, either ;)   But if I don’t prod him, he doesn’t do it.   How do you handle this type of thing? (I can’t just let him wake on his own- our toddler gets up, we have to start our day, we need to get out of the house by a certain time, etc- anything that I can let slide, I do)   I think my frustration is compounded by the fact that he has a high pressure job that I nearly ALL logistical handling of moving pieces being timed correctly... so he clearly can create and adhere to rigid time constraints in his career.   Thanks for any advice :)
