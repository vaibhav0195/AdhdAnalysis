How do you deal with it?    It happens a lot over here, usually over something small.  Tonight it was because he decided he wants to help with the kids schooling (we homeschool).  As background: He's done maybe 2-3 lessons in five years with them.  I do ALL of the research on curriculum, prepping, planning, and 99.9% of the teaching.  He doesn't even know what we are doing at any given time.  Anyway, our two boys also have adhd and are very behind but I have a new math curriculum I'm doing with them and trying to get them caught up.  My 10 year old was badly dis-regulated earlier today so when dad got home I asked that he do the math lesson with the two older boys.   There is a section on calendars and I asked him to make sure he went over where the month and year is shown, and things of that nature.  It was about 30 more seconds to do.  He completely ignored it.  When I asked him again to make sure he did that he insisted (and still insists) that it is not what the book says to cover (it's a scripted curriculum) so he doesn't agree to cover it yet.  I mean really, we are just filling holes and they've learned the calendar many times before.  They just tend to forget information. He just absolutely refused to go off script.  Everything having to be twenty times harder than it needs to be drives me up the wall.  It was a simple request.   Now I feel like I can't ask him for help with school any more.
