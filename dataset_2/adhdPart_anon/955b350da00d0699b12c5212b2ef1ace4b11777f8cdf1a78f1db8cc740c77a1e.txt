How do you make sure you prioritise your relationship on a regular basis?;;;He doesn’t like systems, rules, lists etc. So when I suggested that we have a date night once a week, to make sure we prioritise our relationship on a regular basis, he’s said that he didn’t think it’s the best approach. He doesn’t want ‘enjoying time together’ to feel like a chore.  I, on the other hand, love structure and routines. I thrive on it. When I’m living a life with my priorities straight, I know I’m living a good life.  We had a talk about this just now, and he agreed that we could try it out every other week to start with, and if that works out, we can slowly increase it to every week.   We both have very busy lives, and I suffer from a mental illness too (cyclothymia), so this is my best guess on how to enjoy quality time together on a regular basis. I just really want to make sure we keep prioritising each other no matter how busy or overwhelming life gets.  I guess I just want to know if there another approach you have tried out with your partner that may work better than mine?
