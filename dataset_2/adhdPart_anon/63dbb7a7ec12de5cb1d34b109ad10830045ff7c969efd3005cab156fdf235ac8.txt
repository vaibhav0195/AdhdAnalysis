63dbb7a7ec12de5cb1d34b109ad10830045ff7c969efd3005cab156fdf235ac8;;;Need help with my boyfriend's situation ASAP :(;;;My boyfriend (22yr) just recently got diagnosed with ADD and has been on medication for a few weeks but he believes he's getting worse because he checks out on 4 out of the 6 symptoms of low dopamine disorders and that has led him to believe that he has no future.   I don't know what to do to get him to feel better about himself because of my inept knowledge of the disorder and the fact that I'm dealing with CPTSD and OCD myself.   Please help. I really can't lose him. He means the world to me.
