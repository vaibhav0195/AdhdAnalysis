Please don’t flame me if I misunderstood anything.  I’ve recently found out that the guy I’m seeing has ADHD and would like to know more about this situation. We’re not in an “official” relationship yet but I do think there are some parts of his ADHD that’s hindering our relationship from progressing further.   A little background is that this guy told me he wasn’t ready to be in a committed relationship because of his career. He wasn’t happy with it but as far as I can see wasn’t doing anything to change it either. While browsing through some other threads earlier, I can see that’s rather common, being paralysed by fear and being unable to focus.   Anyways I continued seeing him and we remained close. Even more so in the past couple of months (and especially weeks) when he finally told me he’s got ADHD. He wasn’t using it as an excuse but in hindsight it made sense with his somewhat “flaky” behaviour. Like he could be all over me one weekend, updating about the tiniest stuff. And then suddenly the next Monday he’s only “replying” my messages (like he replies, but not very responsive or inquisitive).   I’m certain he has feelings for me, but he’s the type of person who’ll shoulder his burdens quietly. Like he would very rarely let me know when something’s bothering him and most of the time I have to probe. How do I show him that I care and let him know I want to progress this relationship (accepting him for who he is)? And what are other general tips that you can give me, both in terms of showing support for him and for coping with his “flaky” attitude?
