My partner is loving and kind, and despite ADHD is very highly successful and great in a social setting. However, with romantic relationships there is great struggle where my partner can see saw in emotions from happiness to sadness. It's clear that there's an overlap from depression, but it leads to them lashing out and questioning the relationship itself, and how we are both not good for each other. While it's true that long distance and past baggage doesn't help much right now, what I'm struggling with is sticking to the goal of truly trying to let the past be in the past, and to not question our viability as a couple every other day.  Are there recommendations for good relationship practices for two highly motivated "type A" people who can self learn, but seem to be unable to avoid the past baggage from coming into discussions all the time? We are also open to exploring couples therapy at some point as we recognize our value together, the joy we can have. It's just been nearly two months straight of painful discussions and fights, and sometimes feeling nothing is worth it.   Thanks in advance for any help and guidance. Wishing you all love and warmth in your relationships and trials with life. Best, Vish.
