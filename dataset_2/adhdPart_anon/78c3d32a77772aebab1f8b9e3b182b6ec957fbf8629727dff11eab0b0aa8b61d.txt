78c3d32a77772aebab1f8b9e3b182b6ec957fbf8629727dff11eab0b0aa8b61d;;;Feeling Alone;;;I just found this subreddit and it’s been so amazing to read through. I am a 23F married to a 22M with very severe auditory ADHD (medicated). We’ve been married for almost 3 years, and we have a son who is almost a year old. My husband is super loving, and he really does care about me and our son, but I seriously struggle with feeling so lonely.  Whenever we were dating a lot of our relationship was long distance, so we spent many many hours talking over Skype until we fell asleep. My husband used to spend so much time on me, and genuinely went out of his way to write poetry for me, to take me on dates, to talk to me about life and just ask how I was doing. Now I can hardly get him to spend any time with me without him falling into a deep depression or just being a blob of flesh because he’s bored and not “accomplishing” something. However, he can spend literally all day on his computer playing a game and talking with all of his friends in discord (we just had COVID and we were in isolation for 10 days so he didn’t have to work... he spent the entire time on the computer from the time he woke up). I struggle with feeling like how could he give me so much of his love and attention in the past, and now after all we’ve been through is he so unable to give me any.  I love him so much and I try so hard to be understanding and not take things personally, but it just builds up and I start to feel so lonely and hurt. I understand that he needs some down time everyday, and time for his hobby, so I work hard to keep our son occupied and give him that time everyday. It just seems like the amount of time is never enough. He works full time and I spend my days watching our infant, managing our house, managing our budget, and being a SAHM. By the time my son goes to bed I just want some relaxing time with another adult, but my husband ignores me and then I start to miss my son being awake because he at least wants to be around me. Sometimes I’ll crawl into his crib with him and snuggle him just so I’m not alone. It’s hard because my husband is in the same room as me, and yet he’s in a completely different world. How is it that you can be so lonely and yet the person you love is physically near you all the time?  I’m almost in tears as I write this. I honestly don’t even know what the solution is. We’ve talked about it over and over and over, and he just has no balance. If he’s not hyper focused on something then he goes into a depression and then I feel guilty for wanting him to step away from his game. I’m really struggling because I just started a part time job in the evenings, so now we are going to see each other even less and I just don’t want our relationship to fall apart. I’m afraid of being around other people and starting to feel more appreciated by random people then I do by my husband. A lot of times he acts like I’m so clingy or needy because I ask for time together (not time in the same room or with him on his phone while laying next to me, actual time TOGETHER). I struggle with feeling like someone else would appreciate me way more then he does and sometimes I just feel like I would be seen as being SO low maintenance compared to most women. I love my husband though and I don’t want to have these thoughts. My marriage and our family is the MOST important thing to me and I will do anything to keep us together and healthy. I want to protect our relationship and our marriage, and I just don’t want anything to pull me away.  I don’t want to be bitter and upset at him. I want to live in understanding and love. I don’t want to be selfish. I just feel so very lonely and unseen. I married my husband because I wanted to spend my life with him, and it’s hard to feel like I am when he has his headphones on and spends his time in a completely different world.   The rare times we do have together though are my absolute favorite times. He is the most amazing man to me, and I am so in love with everything about him. I could listen to him talk about the most boring thing and be completely interested by it for hours. I would literally do any activity with him just to be doing something together. I compare him to other men I know and I’m constantly blown away by how amazing he is and how lucky I am to have him. I just wish that I had more of his time, and some of his attention. I just don’t want to feel alone. I feel as if I’m constantly near the most amazing and sexy man, and yet I’m not interesting enough to get his attention.   I don’t know what the point of this post is really except for just a way for me to vent and also to just reach out and maybe encourage someone else who is happily married to someone with ADHD but struggles with feeling alone. I’m thankful for this community and that I found it. It’s easy to feel very lonely when you’re the non-ADHD partner. Thanks to each of you for being here and being vulnerable. It makes me feel less alone. 💕
