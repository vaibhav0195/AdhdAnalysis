I've been with my partner almost 5 years and during that time he has never been to the dentist.  His teeth, which are naturally very nice, are starting to yellow and his gums are starting to bleed.  He is also getting swollen lymph nodes in his neck, which I suspect are from an oral infection somewhere because his teeth desperately need to be cleaned (not to mention any other issues that might be present).   All this to say, I'm worried for his health and also getting pretty grossed out.  We've been having this conversation since last February when I first did the math and realized he had never mentioned a dentist appointment during our entire relationship.  I've tried to explain to him that oral hygiene is important, that he's creating a mess for his future self, that I really don't want to be with someone who is eventually going to lose their teeth and how expensive dental work is if left untreated.  I've offered to call and make the appointment for him.  I've made deals (I'll go the gym - he's very big on the gym and admittedly I'm not so it's important to him, if he goes to the dentist.  And I've upheld my end of the bargain, because he's right. I should make going to the gym a priority for my health).    The last conversation we had he got really defensive and angry with me, saying "\*You're\* not going to make my dentist appointment for me and you need to let this go."  But reddit, I kind of can't.  This is important.  And I know it's an ADHD thing (because this isn't normal), I just can't figure out which roadblock to help him remove.  I thought it was whole calling and making an appointment but that seemed to make him feel shitty when I was going to do it.  I just want to help and have a partner with teeth.  Any ideas?
