c8e06d951c096295f074d8fcb966c1b537adb61e46aa4ee01d571ed58e1af788;;;Every surface in our home is covered with stuff, and it annoys me so much;;;I currently spend the work week away from home. I do my share of the chores on the weekend. And right now I'm so effing annoyed with the stuff. Everything, everywhere.      Granted, we have a 50 square meter apartment. Currently the living room floor holds six piles of workout clothes (clean), two swords, cotton/oil/sandpaper for sword maintenance, 18 books for his one math exam, four backpacks (one full of playing cards), empty bottles, a formal suit, seven pairs of boots, two pieces of luggage, several kinds of medication, batteries, gum, duct tape, a unicorn, four dumbbells, three bottles of water, a winter hat, and three single socks. There's clothes on his desk, milk and tissues on top of the fridge, and the sink contains eight knifes because he can't be bothered to handwash them.       I can't stand visual noise. It grinds my gears. He hates when I move his stuff. He hates cleaning up because it takes a full day (well, it wouldn't if he could just put away each item after he's done using it).   Thanks to anyone who read through this. I don't even know if I want advice or just a pat on the back.
