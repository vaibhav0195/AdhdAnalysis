2e95dde0c8e4994aedad4ed08877bdceb29b9577ef041a5983880e65e5380d6d;;;Pregnant on moving day and already beyond frustrated...;;;I’m pregnant and moving out of my NDX soon to be ex-boyfriends place to a place of my own for me and the baby because I cannot rely on him and I don’t want the baby around his temper tantrums and rages or dismissive attitude. So, that’s already pretty stressful.   But today is moving day and after pulling teeth to get the help I needed packing now he’s got an attitude and I’m just wondering if I’m in the wrong here or not because I’m about to lose my temper..  The movers were supposed to be here between 8-10am. Partner was supposed to put a door back up on a back room last night so we could put the cats away while They were here. He didn’t. So I woke him up around 7a so we could get it done. He needed to get breakfast first. Which is fine there’s a 2 hour window but I was still nervous. But we make it back around 8:10.. they’re not here he puts in the door we finish setting up. I come out to the garage and he’s doing his hobbies. I realize we don’t have cash to tip them, he says he’ll go when he’s done “this” around 930 he goes and gets cash...   He gets back they’re still not here they call that they’ll be late. (Very frustrating) It’s 10:10 and he comes to me and says “I’m gunna go take a shower” I’m baffled by this. I tell him that and that I’d prefer if he didn’t and he immediately gets pissed says I’m ridiculous. Says “why. Can’t you just deal with them?” And then storms off and sits across the garage from me on his phone. I say “Really?” And he shouts in a snotty tone “WHATEVER ‘SOMUCHSaturn”  Am I crazy or is it crazy to want to shower 10 mins before movers get here?
