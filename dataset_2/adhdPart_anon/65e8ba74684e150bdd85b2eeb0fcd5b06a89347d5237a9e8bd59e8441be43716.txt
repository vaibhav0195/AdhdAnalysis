My partner (Dx M31) sometimes comes with me to work so that he can get some volunteer experience (he's switching career paths so he needs some relevant experience before he applies). He's kind of like our office intern I guess. The latest thing I have asked him to do is help clean out storage. He told me sporadically what he needed from me leading up to this, and I made it very clear that I would not be able to help out today because I had back to back meetings all day. This turned into a fight today and he ended up leaving.   I'm not sure how to handle this situation - it keeps happening any time we ask him to come help us out with anything. There's definitely a weird dynamic between us when he comes to work with me... he wants me to help but then not micro manage and just let him figure out how to do things on his own. I don't know what he needs. He says he tells me, but maybe I'm just not getting it or reading through the lines well enough? Help! How do you get anything done when trying to plan ahead with your ADHD partner? Chores, events... anything! I'm frustrated and confused.
