I can't remember a year where I haven't had at least one student with it.   I am pretty sure my fiance (32,M) has ADHD. He has the classic symptoms of it- inattention, hyper-focus on certain tasks, forgetful, doesn't pay attention to details, begins tasks without plans, waits until the last minute, feels worthless at times, etc...   He has sort of joked about having ADHD before, but hasn't been tested or diagnosed. It's sort of been used as an excuse for things and not taken seriously. The problem is that many of our arguments result from behaviors that go with this. How can I talk to him about him possibly having it and maybe talking to someone about it without offending him?  Any suggestions would be helpful.
