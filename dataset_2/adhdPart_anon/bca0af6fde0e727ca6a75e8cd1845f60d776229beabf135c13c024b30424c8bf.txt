While I think the anxiety is impacted a lot by the ADHD, she and her doctor have decided to treat the anxiety first. I've encouraged her to try therapy as well but she's apprehensive about it. She's feeling better with the medication so I try to be gentle about it as it is her choice and doesn't impact our relationship too much. This is the medication she remembers to take more often than the other.  While working to determine the cause of the chronic pain, her doctor has put her on muscle relaxers that she is supposed to take a couple times a day to help manage it. She frequently skips doses and the resulting pain causes her a lot of stress. When I ask, her reasons for skipping are either that she forgets (most common), or that it is too late. She has alarms set and will wait until a 'more convenient' time, which usually ends with her forgetting. I asked her to bring this up at her last visit a few weeks ago in hopes she could work out a different treatment plan, but she forgot to, so she's still on the same meds with the same dosing schedule until her next visit in a couple months.  We operate on opposite schedules - she works 3 days a week from 7pm to 7am, and I work Mon-Fri 8am to 5pm. I want to find a way to help her take her medication as intended, but the time she usually takes them I am asleep. She attempts to bring her pill bottles to work, but frequently forgets them. We've talked about getting her one of those daily pill organizers to keep in her backpack or lunchbox, but that doesn't address the issue of timing.   All that to ask the following - do any of you have tips for helping your partners remember their medications, especially during times of the day when you can't communicate with/see them?
