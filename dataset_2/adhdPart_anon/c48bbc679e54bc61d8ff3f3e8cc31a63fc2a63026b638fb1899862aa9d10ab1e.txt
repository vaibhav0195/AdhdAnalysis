I feel almost every strong emotion my partner has (usually pain in throat or back, but also racing thoughts, teary etc) which is both a blessing and a real struggle sometimes. I love feeling him in such an intimate way but when he loses control/ gets heightened so do I. It's like we're mirrors and it can be so tiring! It's like I have ADHD sometimes too haha. I just get so emotional for like a split second, bawling my eyes out about something small (while he's seething) then 5 mins later be fine. I don't want to detach from this gift but I just feel so out of control sometimes with it. He's 38M, diagnosed non meds btw.  Ps I've only had this empathic gift with him ! Never had any experience with it before so relatively new.  Tia

I'm slowly trying to get into this subreddit again and feel confident to share what's going on as I often just deal with it on my own.  I want to know some peoples' thoughts on this:  My partner (38M ADHD DX, non medicated) and I have had a pretty rocky relationship this last 14 or so months if I'm honest (we've been together 2 years almost). We're deeply in love and have a close friendship and a very healthy sex life. But we argue quite a bit (a few times a week), typically about very minor things (the way it usually goes is he'll say something I did bothered him, I'll get defensive, he'll retaliate and say something not very nice and I'll cry). Earlier this year (mid pandemic) we had some awful arguments, probably 1 every 3 days which were absolutely emotion-filled, yelling (him and me) and crying (me). Often about things related to my past or minor things, and mainly brought up by him. They were like explosions. I felt like I couldn't catch a break, and some hurtful things were said that devastated me. I don't deny my part in that but it definitely felt like a victim (I don't really like that word) situation. Anyway after some very big conversations he agreed to get help for his ADHD and since then (3 or so months ago) we have had some real breakthroughs - significantly less arguing, very few disrespectful or hurtful things being said, just such a big change. But today my partner has said to me he thinks that I cause a lot of our issues (though he did admit it's both of us) and that I've changed (I'm more sensitive now and I blow things out of proportion). It really sounds like he's given up :( he said this is the hardest relationship he's been in cuz he's more invested. I worry his feelings towards me have changed.   He's not wrong about those things at all, but I can't help but feel a bit shit that now that he thinks I'm the problem with the relationship (getting unduly upset, being sensitive and emotional) when I do think that I've become this way because of a lack of ADHD management in the beginning (that is by no means me wiping my hands clean either!).  I feel like now he's really corrected his behaviour, I'm left with some scars and wounds and am dealing with issues just like how he used to. Like cause and effect? Not sure. It's like the tables have turned and I'm now the irritational one!? It feels so unfair :( It's like he doesn't see how he can still contribute to difficulties. When I try to tell him I'm upset about something he has gotten so sick of hearing bad shit/criticisms (I know people with ADHD can take things very harshly) that he sometimes just rolls his eyes or says 'what now' and won't even hear me out. That further upsets me then it turns into more of a thing than it needs to be! He asks "why can't we just bring things up and deal with it quickly" as if he's not got ADHD lol. I feel like pulling my hair out!   I still do feel justified in the things I bring up with him (usually my issues with him are around how he communicates or if he says something insulting or mean) but my approach is never right for him and the more he gets annoyed the more I get upset.  Also, the pandemic has been so hard on him. He gets bored so easily and says his life is so boring. He's even admitted to starting arguments cuz he's bored! He's also been more moody and has taken out his frustrations on me. Does anyone else notice that? Another reason it feels unfair that he seems to think I might be the root cause of the current issues in our relationship. Is it fair to say that our relationship is me, you and ADHD? I mean this sincerely, we would barely argue if ADHD wasn't involved or if it was properly managed. I never nag, I never speak to him meanly or harshly! I'm so easygoing is what is so perplexing. 99% of what I get upset about is when he's said something hurtful or harsh to me. I'm also just so sensitive to any criticism and I've never been like that.   I'm just looking for a bit of advice around healing I suppose, and how anyone else has navigated this. I feel a bit like a wounded puppy, just lashing out at anything and getting upset in an extreme way.    Please no comments around leaving him, I want to heal and to recover from this with him. PS I see a therapist.

Have just been reading posts in this subreddit and feel a lot better already. A bit of background about me: I'm NDX and my bf is DX (non-medicated). We've been together for a couple of years now and he is by far the best person I've ever met: sweet, funny, kind, smart, generous, loving - you name it...total package. I adore him and think the sun shines out his ass haha. But then there's ADD...  The main issues that we have are to do with his moods and lack of emotional regulation when something triggers him. When he gets flooded he'll want to be alone, be very stubborn, just generally not be himself. He ends up usually asking why am I with him and telling me to go be with someone else. It's like every argument is the end of our relationship when it's simply just a fight (often about the silliest things). In the past he said 'I'm done/I'm leaving' but has stopped saying that now as it triggers my abandonment issues... though I think anyone can agree no one would want to hear that. **My question is, how do other people in this group handle nastiness/namecalling etc in an argument with their ADHD partner?** It really gets me down and I'm finding myself retreating to the bathroom to cry a lot more lately (which then ends up with my bf asking WTF is wrong) because it gets too much. I also get sad that it seems like everything is so perfect when we're really good, but then I say something triggering by accident and the rollercoaster starts again. It can be like walking on eggshells. Once he's calmed down/isn't flooded, I can have such a loving conversation with him and he's so remorseful for what he says in the heat of the moment. But right now it's like groundhog day thanks to this pandemic. I try not to tell him how hard it is for me because I really empathise for him - I can see the struggle he's having with his ADD right now but is that really an excuse? **What have other people done in this group to put an end to the insults and putdowns in arguments?** My therapist suggested just putting on an imaginary shield and reminding myself whatever he says in an argument isn't true but it's so hard. I also want to hold him accountable for what he says, right?!  I should mention I've been trying to use boundaries (with a lot of trial and error). Whenever he calls me a name, I say "I don't like being disrespected - let me know when you're able to speak to me respectfully" (which he hates obviously!) or when he says he's not coming to something (when he actually does want to) I'll say "I'm sad you're not coming but I understand you don't feel like it, that's fine". I get the usual "You're abandoning me" "You clearly don't care" etc. Actually since I've started having more boundaries I've found it's set him off more and he's pushing for a reaction more. **Has anyone else found that?**  Also, he's going to be trying medication soon as he has acknowledged he can't go on like this. I feel horrible sometimes blaming the majority of our relationship issues on ADD but honestly right now, it is the driving force of our arguments. I just want my feelings acknowledged and for him to make a change for himself, for me, for us. **Has anyone here got a partner with ADD and found relief for the moods with medication?** He is so great with his ADD management otherwise and I sometimes even forget he has it.    Above all I'd just love someone to say they know how I feel :( I've read all the books and want to understand ADD much more but I'm feeling really shitty myself. I love my bf so much and don't want to be without him but when I tell him I'm struggling with his moods he really worries I'll leave him even though I don't want to. I shouldn't have to leave him to have the life we deserve! Surely there's another way, where he gets support, and he treats me like I want to be treated - without the rollercoaster. I just want him to get better and feel good. Please give me some hope!!  TLDR; DX bf has mood swings and struggles with emotional regulation, calls me names and says things he doesn't mean - is there anyone who's gone through the same and has advice on boundaries, self care for NDX partner and whether medication has helped? TIA!  xxx

I just wanted to ask others how they handle their own mental health when it comes to an ADHD partner? Mine is 38M and not on medication (but diagnosed and awaiting medication) and while he's been so much better lately (like, made vast improvements with his management of ADHD and the amount of arguments he starts) I still find myself struggling mentally (though I think I'm very strong/resilient, but everyone has their limits!). I struggle sometimes to know if his behaviour is asshole behaviour or ADHD - **how do you guys tell!**? I have firm boundaries now and tell him when I'm feeling upset by his behaviour (mainly telling me to stop talking to him or not touch him or leave him alone) but I most struggle when he's in his ADHD 'mode'. I feel lost and upset and take things he says to heart. He left the house today for the entire day while I was on a phone call and didn't say goodbye or love you or anything which is really unlike him. I was upset because it wasn't very nice, he simply could've come in and given me a kiss quickly, but he was in his ADHD mode so he didn't care that I was upset. Of course I take this very harshly and get really worked up. I wonder if anyone here has any tactics they could share on how to take it less harshly, and wait out their mood and talk to them later about their behaviour? It can take hours as you all know!!  I just can't seem to cut off the hurt feelings when he says something or does something in a mood, like just laugh it off or distract myself. I think I sometimes poke him when he's in a mood just so he can over it faster, I hate a simmering bad mood, especially in such close quarters with COVID. The tension is awful! That said I'd rather a shitty mood than it being taken out on me.  Any help would be great! Thanks so much.
