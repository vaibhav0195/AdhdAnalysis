The thing we struggle with the most are arguments. I’m not innocent in the slightest but I find it really difficult to deal with the arguments we have. They usually start off with something very minor - not ‘argument-worthy’ whatsoever. They will more than likely escalate into something completely unnecessary and completely off topic. We both say hurtful things to each other and I’ll usually end up crying while he stays mad.  He has communicated with me that he would find it useful if I am understanding of his frustration and sympathise and tell him I understand how you’re feeling. But I find this difficult and act defensive and put my emotions first. By this time the argument has escalated.   I feel like every time we put boundaries in place, emotions get the better hand and everything goes out the window.   Does anyone else have experience of similar situations? I would really appreciate any advice you have.
