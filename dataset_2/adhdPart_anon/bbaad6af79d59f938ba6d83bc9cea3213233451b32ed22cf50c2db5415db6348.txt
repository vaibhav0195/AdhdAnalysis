bbaad6af79d59f938ba6d83bc9cea3213233451b32ed22cf50c2db5415db6348;;;So ex's with ADHD ever come back?;;;Hi all my partner of 5 years (32M) recently broke up with me out of the blue (27F), we had been living together for just over a year. I'm pretty devastated over the whole thing. He was diagnosed with ADHD approx a year into our relationship, he said I should watch some videos about it which I did but we never discussed it really, as I think neither of us felt it had a big impact on our relationship, however the more I'm trying to understand our breakup I think it had a much bigger impact than I thought (happy to explain more if people want).  It feels like he's broken up with me more out of impulse (maybe because living with me meant I wasn't an exciting thing to divert his attention as I was around all the time) but I think he might end up regretting it, we were each other's best friends and with a bit of work could have been back on track, but it seems he's jumped ship the minute it got hard. I am starting to process it might be for the best, but part of me still really wants him back.   Tdlr: ADHD partner broke up with me and I'm devastated. Anyone on here with ADHD have you ever regretted breaking up with your partner? Did you ever seek them out again and get back together?
