fcc8ae3443ec8145b5a6e1d117a03e4e900ae469ead3ae8621ed0f51d3225d3a;;;anyone‚Äôs comments are help, you guys are the best help;;;if anyone could help i feel it‚Äôs you i don‚Äôt really like talking about this in person at all, in fact it‚Äôs so much easier just talking right behind a screen for me as sad as it sounds but in reality it‚Äôs crazy because no one would ever think that with the outgoing personality that i‚Äôm lucky to have somehow.  I have adhd I‚Äôve been through almost all of the pills, Concerta, Adderall, Intuniv, Strattera, Focalin, and currently I‚Äôm trying Vyvanse (Lowest Dose) again since the first time in 6th grade (I‚Äôm 18 now) hoping to see maybe a difference in the pill to help me focus, relax and sit still. But with all this stimulants I notice the same thing, yeah my focus goes up but it‚Äôs a constant anxious feeling within me. With non-stimulants I find myself to be really tired or burnt out and just more emotionally sad and I feel it makes my mild depression a little worse. I have to constantly be alone or leave groups of people just so I can have the time to bring me self back down again. My hands have been sweaty for as long as I can remember due to this nervousness. And i‚Äôm just looking for someone with advice, little tricks and tips to calm down. Just ways to cope with this nervousness and help me with my ADHD. (rp)  Any help really is appreciated ü§ç
