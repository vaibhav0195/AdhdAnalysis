It has been something I struggle with every single day. However, after medication, therapy, and learning as much as I could about ADHD, I manage it pretty well. When I read other posts here it it’s usually a Nurotypical female partner describing how difficult it is to be with a male ADHD partner. When I read some of them I am appalled at alot of the behavior that men are blaming on their ADHD. Things that I know I would never do. I feel they are using ADHD as an excuse to be lazy partners. So I have to ask, is being in a relationship w/ a person who has ADHD really THAT bad? Are there no redeeming qualities? My boyfriend and I have been together 7 months now and the thought of him feeling the way ANY of the other people on this sub feel, is terrifying. Please tell me it’s all just yall picking asshole partners and not because I’m just a difficult person to be with....  Edit: a word.
