He always bursts out in anger or frustration and I hate feeling like I’m walking on eggshells sometimes. He would never hurt me or anything like that but there’s been times in the past where he says really rude things and is extremely mean when we have heated arguments, he always ends up regretting it saying it feels like something takes over his brain. In public if people piss him off he gets SO frustrated and it kills his mood. He tends to get in arguments with people easily and if someone pisses him off, his mood is down the whole day. He’s never able to keep a good rapport at work, he’s quit or been fired from a few jobs and seems to always have an issue or beef with someone. I find it to be an extremely unattractive trait and it makes me reconsider things sometimes... I love him and this isn’t all the time but it’s been happening for years and I just the other day found out that adult men with ADHD tend to have problems like this and it explains a lot since he just got diagnosed with it finally. Has anyone experienced issues like this with their partner and once they went on meds did it help?
