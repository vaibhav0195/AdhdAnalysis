He announced that he'd like to romantically separate with me, but to remain close friends. He said he gave it some thought a few days prior to his decision. He had visited some of his best friends after a year, and he said he just felt so different with them. He didn't want to hurt us anymore.   In our relationship together, I had encouraged him from the get-go to seek professional help, I shared so many articles/comics/videos about ADHD and strategies for neurodivergent couples to practice. I encouraged him to be more open about his mental health, especially with his best mates, so he has a stronger support system. It can also alleviate our relationship from friction and responsibility. He was reluctant but not dismissive. It took months of encouragement, depressive episodes, and finally suicidal thoughts to reach out. Then, he said he never given it a thought because he was protective of our relationship, but he realized it was our relationship that was too much for him.  This happened two months ago. After a lot of crying and conversation, we decided to remain friends. We have yet to unpack any thing despite remaining friends. He hasn't brought up any conversation related to our romantic relationship, no second thought, no further inquiries. Our relationship was just dropped.   Yesterday, I asked for space and time apart. He was surprised, he thought we've processed it. How? How? Am I out of my mind? He said maybe this time apart could reveal how raw his feelings still are.   I am still attached to him, and I am trying to work away my fantasy of our future together. It is so difficult. I'm so hurt and angry, I feel like so frustrated at myself for these feelings, for not being able to move on easily. I feel defeated and like I've lost my mind.
