Before meeting him I knew absolutely nothing about It. Im looking for advice from people in more long-term relationships with a partner who has ADHD. Even though we’ve only been together a few months I really believe I’ll be with him for a long time, and am looking to learn more so we can be set up for a successful future. I want to be supportive while also looking out for my own needs in the relationship.   Anything you wish you knew before you started dating?   Any random tips/advice that you’ve learned?  Anything that really helps/makes things worse?   Ways to cope with the issues that stem from ADHD tendencies such as forgetting plans, time management, etc.?   TIA!

I had asked him four or five times if there was anyone he talks to that he has a history with, and he said no. I read the texts and they were not flirty or sexual at all. And he claims he just forgot to tell me or forgot he was even talking to them.   Is this really normal?   I love him and want to make it work, but I feel like he lied to me over and over again. It feels like he hid this from me. But he swears he just forgot to tell me.  We have only been together a few months.  TIA!
