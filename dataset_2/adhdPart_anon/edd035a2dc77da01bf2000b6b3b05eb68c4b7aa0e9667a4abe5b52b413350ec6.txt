We started off as friends so I know a majority of his little ticks. He is currently 18, but was diagnosed as a child. He was determined to do school without medication until his senior year so he’s been medicated for about two years. He isn’t severe, but when he stops his medication he gets more fidgety, train of thought is far more jumbled, and he tends to get more anxious. It’s manageable, however, I’m worried about behaviour I might not see when we aren’t together. He struggles with being totally oblivious to romantic notions and has issues reading others emotions. It’s taken me months to get him to notice that I might be interested, and now that we both know these feelings are mutually there, I can see him fighting his extreme shyness and anxiety to get to that next stage however it’s very hard for him. (He can’t look/talk to me anymore without hiding behind his friends. It’s sweet but also so many steps backwards from where we started.)  Is there an effective way to address my needs and provide consistency at the begging so he understands my boundaries?   Are there things I should be reading looking into before I throw myself into a relationship with him?
