We've know each other for 3 years and been in a committed relationship for around 1.5 years. Before that it was more of a friends/ FWB situation. My partner struggles with a cocktail of ADHD, chronic depression and anxiety.   For the 3 years that I've known my partner, he's been unemployed. Prior to that he was finishing a PhD. My partner and I don't live together. He experienced a loss in the first year of me knowing him so I didn't expect him to be looking for work at that time. Also, I've dealt with long-term depression and unemployment in the past, so I empathize to an extent. But 3 years is a long time.   He takes his meds consistently and has recently gone back to therapy and has seen an unemployment agent. But he rarely turns in job applications. It's affecting how I feel in the relationship and I would like to look to the future with him.   I'd rather bring up issues than let it fester and ruin the intimacy. The problem is that talking about the future is a trigger for either RSD or depressive episodes for him. He shuts down and can't talk for days. I feel terrible for triggering him, but also feel at a loss for how to have a conversation about what we want for the future of our relationship. Does anyone out there have advice?  tl;dr - My unemployed partner shuts down/ has RSD episodes when I try and talk about our future. How to handle this?
