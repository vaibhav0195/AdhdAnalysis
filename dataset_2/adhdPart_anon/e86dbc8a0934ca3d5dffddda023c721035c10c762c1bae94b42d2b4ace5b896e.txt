e86dbc8a0934ca3d5dffddda023c721035c10c762c1bae94b42d2b4ace5b896e;;;Advice/guidance, pls?;;;Hey all! Seeking a bit of advice/guidance. For context, my boyfriend (24) is officially diagnosed with ADHD and unofficially with autism/autistic tendancies, and I (23) have OCD, anxiety and depression and suffer from quite extreme mood swings and emotional instability (what a pair, huh?).  We've been together a year and we love each other a lot. However, we keep having very similar arguments over and over and it's making us quite upset. The arguments are often around my boyfriend's need for 'alone time'. Basically, because of his ADHD and aspie tendencies, he gets quite exhausted by social interaction (even with me) and often needs to spend a fair amount of time alone. I, however, am the opposite; I crave being with him whenever I can. At the moment, we see one another a few times a week and sleep at each other's twice a week. Quite often, when we've been hanging out but there was no plan for me to sleep at his, I'll want to stay over. He finds this quite difficult when we haven't planned it and often says no. Because of my emotional instability and anxiety/depression issues, this can make me really upset and angry and I sometimes end up self harming. I see other couples spontaneously deciding to spend the night together and this not being an issue and, honestly, it makes me jealous.   So, I was just wondering if any of you have had similar issues or can give any advice about how to handle this? Any tips for learning not to take it is so personally when your partner doesn't want to spend time with you? Any tips for aspie people on how to better cope with spontaneity and spending more time with their partners?
