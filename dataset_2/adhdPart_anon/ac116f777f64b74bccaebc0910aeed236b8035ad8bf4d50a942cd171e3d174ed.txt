But what did he do?;;;I posted this as a comment somewhere else but I really wanted to just share this with you all:  He saw that I was putting a lot of effort into some big batches of apple butter. Because of my joint pain, we got me a crank style apple peeler online, and it was just laughably crap. He helped me try to fit these apples on this dang thing without chopping our respective fingers off and it was both dumb and funny.   So he went online and ordered me a top notch fancy ass corer/slicer/peeler/spiralizer attachment for my Kitchenaid mixer. It arrived just in time for my second big batch, and it worked like a charm. We had so much fun turning this machine on and watching it core/peel/slice all these apples like magic.  So, did he plan on the perfect gift for me ahead of time? No, he didn't.   But what he did do was notice my struggles, address and respond to them in a way I wouldn't have thought of, used his ADHD superpowers to pull some fantastic strings, and showed up for me exactly when I needed him to, exactly the way I needed him to, and helped me accomplish a task I wouldn't have been able to finish on my own.   Sometimes we forget that our partners don't always show love the way we expect, but sometimes that's the exact type of love we need &lt;3
