I love my partner dearly (dating for 1.5 years) and we're about to get married in the next year or so. My partner has the typical ADHD symptoms although he's not officially diagnosed. My main takeaway so far has been that their brains are wired differently, and always always remember it's a "us vs the problem" approach.  So my question is - with the different wiring, **I'd like to get the ADHD partner's perspectives of what your partners do that works well for you, helps you be a better person, and makes you feel loved** (esp those in long term relationships). I'd like to prepare as best as I can to be a good partner in our future marriage and also to ensure that our marriage is rock-solid. *If there's already a thread on this, I'd appreciate a link to it!*  As an example, right now my partner is rushing his essay due in a few hours - he usually submits right on the DOT and sleeps the day away, but this round it seems like he's gonna submit ahead of time. The reason is because I've made it clear that he needs some sleep to attend scheduled house-viewings with me tomorrow, and that I'm really excited about it. So I've heaped on praises like I'm proud of him for submitting ahead of time and getting some rest etc to be awake with me tomorrow (although I feel like I'm mothering him). Is this a good approach? How can I replicate this behaviour for future essays without the "event"?
