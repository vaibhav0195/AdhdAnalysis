Ive been with my partner on and off for two years. Only recently I learned there is a name for what he has been doing, stonewalling. Ive known Ive been given the silent treatment and behaviour I only can describe as devalue/discard (so I have often been worried he was also a narcissist, since all the above is traits of that, and Im still questioning it). On the other hand it can also be a coping mechanism, a result of living his whole life undiagnosed adhd, until a year ago.   As a result of this, mixed with belittlening, compulsive lying, and (unintentional?) gaslighting, I dont really know how to stay understanding or patient about it. I am trying to empathize with how a life with undiagnosed adhd can have evolved to this behaviour.  What Im struggling with is that he seems to excuse this with his adhd, and i somewhat do too. But unintentionally or not, it is emotional abuse, and this is an abusive relationship.   I dont know if he will ever reach a point where he realizes that his adhd isnt a free ticket to emotionally abuse ones partner (or accidentially(?) sexually abuse, which happend too).  He keeps telling me I need to go to therapy, which I do and soon will be, I have codependent traits and fear of abandonment. (Which this relationship has made so much worse, because he pushes on my trauma weekly). Yet he still hasnt reached out for any help with coping with his adhd behaviour and coping mechanisms, and Im afraid he never will.
