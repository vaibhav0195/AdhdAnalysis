My ADHD husband and I have been together for ~10 years, married for 3. Weâ€™re both in our early 20s, and we have a 7 month old daughter. I am looking for support/advice on how non-ADHD partners who were able to step out of their parentilized roles did so, and whether/how to avoid seeing DH as â€˜infantilizedâ€™, since Iâ€™m the one who basically has to set his â€˜choresâ€™ or â€˜workloadâ€™ around the house, which is incredibly stressful for me at this time for various reasons.   (Iâ€™m a recent law grad, studying for the UBE in my jurisdiction, and we had our first child in November.)   I love him to death, but I see our intimacy and passion waning as the foundation of respect and trust weâ€™ve built seems to be eroded, slowly, with each task I have to set for him that he apparently didnâ€™t/couldnâ€™t/canâ€™t see, due to his ADHD? I feel like such a horrible person, blaming someone for the way their mind works, but Iâ€™m also not sure how to continue seeing him as an equal partner in our relationship, when, essentially, he isnâ€™t. Please help! Support would be lovely, and advice (even constructive criticism) is welcome.
