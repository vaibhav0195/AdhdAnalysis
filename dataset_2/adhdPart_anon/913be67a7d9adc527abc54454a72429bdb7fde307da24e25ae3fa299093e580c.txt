When we first moved in together he'd go on regular rants on how much "stuff" I had. That everywhere he'd look was my things. Granted, I brought in a lot more furniture and kitchen items into the relationship, but beyond that I didn't see an overabundance of my things in the space. I reduced what I did have or and got rid of some of the unneeded items since it seemed to bother him so much. I regret some of the items I've tossed, but he still seems to think I have too much stuff and need to get rid of it.    He's also had moments where he's been frustrated with me leaving (in his words) trash everywhere that he needs to clean up, junk just sitting out in his way, etc. I've been trying to be really conscious of this and making sure I put items in their home when I'm done with it. I constantly feel like I'm just a slob and a horrible housekeeper because I can't seem to keep it clean enough for him.   Well, with the pandemic I'm off work so I decided to do some deep spring cleaning. What I've discovered: our kitchen table is unusable because it's COVERED in his things. 100% of the items on there are his. He has a tendency to hoard paper towels and napkins and leave them everywhere. I picked up 6 so far today. He has over 8 pairs of headphones. He has a pile of "future projects" just sitting in the office space that have no home. Everywhere I look is piles and piles of papers, electronics, project bits, etc etc. But he doesn't see any of it. He just sees my stuff, my messes.   Is this an ADHD thing? Any tips on how to approach this?
