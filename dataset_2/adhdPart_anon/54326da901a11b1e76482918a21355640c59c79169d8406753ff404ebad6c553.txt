54326da901a11b1e76482918a21355640c59c79169d8406753ff404ebad6c553;;;Please help: ADHD partner (DX/medicated) not responsible for “night behavior” after medicine wears off;;;My boyfriend of over a year hits about 8:30 pm (when his daily dosage wears off) and he shrugs his shoulders and says I can’t hold him responsible for the things he does, says, forgets, etc. after this point. These things include but are not limited to: hyper focusing on conversations; mostly regarding a way in which he feels I’ve wronged him but refuses to listen to me when I try to engage in the conversation, leaving the kitchen a complete disaster from whatever snack/drink he’s made, leaving the oven on, water running, fridge or freezer open all night, telling me I don’t care about him or his thoughts when it’s 2:30 am and I have to get up at 5 for work and ask if we can pick up a discussion (that has been going around in the same circles for 3+ hours) again the next day. I am NT, medicated for depression/anxiety so I understand that our minds are not always on our side, but these behaviors that he accepts ZERO responsibility for are only feeding my anxiety. Has anyone else experienced anything similar and found good resources/been able to successfully address this kind of shirking behavior?
