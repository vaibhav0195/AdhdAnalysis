As my headline suggests I am looking for advice and experiences of ADHD partners or people suffering from ADHD to tell me what they were able to work on.  My partner is as exhausted as most posts on this sub suggest and basically broke up with me. After long talking and suggesting things we agreed to work on our relationship through couples therapy, dedicated date nights and me abstaining from gaming/too much surfing as it definitely decreases my attention span. I am also in therapy and on medication but there might be other things I might not be thinking off that helped your relationship.  Thanks in advance!
