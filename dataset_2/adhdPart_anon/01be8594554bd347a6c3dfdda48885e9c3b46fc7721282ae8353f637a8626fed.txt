What can I do to both help him adjust to being neuro-atypical as well as help with reminders / etc. He actually seems to have worsened as well as become more irritable after the diagnosis and treatment and I wonder if this is his hyper awareness of having the characteristics of ADHD that he’s had his whole life.   Are there any overarching do’s or dont’s?  P.s. I’m not sure what the DX vs NDX stands for? Diagnosed vs not-diagnosed or newly-diagnosed? Both in reference to the person with ADHD?
