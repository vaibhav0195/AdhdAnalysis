We have a 6 month old and he barely does anything to help. He also has no patience. I'm back at work and he is unemployed right now so he is technically watching the baby but I come out every chance I get to play/ feed/ put down for naps etc. Whenever our little one is fussy, cries, is clingy etc (which is basically everyday bc he's a baby) he gets in a MOOD. I can hear his frustration and stomping around. I can hear him raise his voice at our 6 MONTH OLD. Ugh.   Parenting is hard enough and I have no idea what it's like for him. I try to have empathy but at the same time I'm struggling. I literally do everything around the house already, i do most of the baby care, while working full time. He sleeps in till noon, and all he really needs to do is play/ engage with our child but it's like "too much" for him.   So back to this baby #2 deal... I really want another one. We had always talked about 2. But I honestly don't think he's a good parent, he's a mediocre husband, and I don't have it in me to take care of both kids and him and work.   But I can't exactly tell him "I don't want another baby because I don't think you're capable of being a good father" ... bc well that would crush him.   Sigh. This wasn't meant to be a vent but it turned out to be one.

However... his adhd makes it VERY challenging. At any given time there are about 10 ongoing or unfinished projects.   He rushes to start a project bc he’s impulsive. As a result he doesn’t plan. When he doesn’t plan he forgets something, is missing a part or tool, or the project doesn’t work out the way he had envisioned.   He then gets frustrated, and into the spiraling self pity. “I can’t do anything right. I’m never fixing anything again. Our lives will just be ruined forever. I suck as a man”   I don’t really care about the projects - we can just hire someone to fix things. But he doesn’t want to do that. He always says he can do it and either never gets around to it or doesn’t finish.   Does anyone have suggestions on how I can get him to slow down and plan/ think projects through? Or just be ok when they don’t work? Hire someone to do it?
