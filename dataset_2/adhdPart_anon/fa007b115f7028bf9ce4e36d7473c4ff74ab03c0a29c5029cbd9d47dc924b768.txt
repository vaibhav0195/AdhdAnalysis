fa007b115f7028bf9ce4e36d7473c4ff74ab03c0a29c5029cbd9d47dc924b768;;;My boyfriend (23m) keeps deliberately not listening to me about things;;;Any time i talk to him about things he might not want to hear, he doesnt “hear” me and then blames me for not telling him things, when o very did clearly verbalize at the time of relevance (i.e. if were low on weed, ill tell him when were about both half way through our stash and when we have about a gram left. He’ll consistently get mad when we get to smoking the gram we have left, telling me i didnt “warn him” that our stash is low).   I dont want to have to write down and take notes on every convo we have. Ive talked to him about this multiple times but every time he just says im lying and that i dont verbalize. Its driving me insane.
