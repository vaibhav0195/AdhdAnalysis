c445f58d2ebab309c4bbe3ab532e5f1a037f3c3e74c2791588fac3bfdb4df1f8;;;I'm not sure what to title this....;;;This is my first post on here.... on reddit...ever. And I just have to say.....  &amp;#x200B;  I never knew. I didn't know that there were others out there. Who had partners like mine, and are able to so accurately describe how I have felt in situations. The hurt and the frustration, but also the strength and the immense sense of understanding. I'm tearing up cuz now I'm not alone.   &amp;#x200B;  I do have a question or several... My spouse (35M - DX Medicated) and I (30F - DX not Medicated) have been together for almost a decade. And we both have grown and learned alot in that time, but now I'm questioning what behaviors do I just need to accept... how do I know when I'm asking too much of my partner? And how do I get him more active in our daily life? I love my partner desperately, he has the kindest heart, and when he's off his meds he's super funny and quirky (while being a little chaotic) and I really want to do what is best for the both of us, but it's hard to know when I'm pushing something that's worth pushing, and when I need to just accept I'm pushing against a brick wall, and maybe even doing more harm than good. I'm just stumped.   &amp;#x200B;  But I'm glad to know I'm not alone in these struggles!
