05a3371efe0fa534c94b459543bbc429bc2ea3f8bb0ecbd4ac60a7ac24fe3932;;;Advice for finding a helpful ADHD therapist;;;Hi everyone,  My DX husband has not been having a lot of success with his therapist. Although he was diagnosed and is now medicated, it's basically been an entire year of *only* medicine adjustments, normally based on what my husband says he wants to try/change from his own research and anecdotal experience. Meanwhile, he struggles daily because the medicine is clearly not helping enough and there has been no therapy or life advice support (even when he asked his therapist for it).  I want to help but I'm honestly at a loss. I'm not from the US (where we live) and I have very little experience finding specialists that a) take our insurance and b) would be helpful for ADHD. I recognize that he should also be his own advocate, but we are both swamped with work right now, and the ADHD symptoms (combined with possible depression) makes it very hard for him to advocate for himself.   Do you guys have any advice? How did your partners find a therapist that actually helped? Any advice would be appreciated. This is just a stressful situation for both of us. I just want him to get the help he genuinely wants.
