For example: 1) when I open my bedroom door to let air in, she would come out of her room and check what’s happening. 2) when I go out to do laundry, she would immediately come out of her room and talk about how she should do laundry too. 3) when I make some noise near the bathroom, she would immediately come out of her room and go to the bathroom.   Our other roommate thinks she has undiagnosed ADHD. But this other roommate is not bothered by this.   So could she have undiagnosed ADHD? I find it very irritating as I don’t want to feel someone’s always watching me and reacting to the little things I do.   How can we make our lives living together better? Should I tell her what I think?
