4a2cc7b43bec8d919e8cfb4c1b9671b66c95d7dbe021275fde17bdf1f1568d54;;;my partner (m/29/dx) and I had a spat over the apartment not being clean;;;My partner and I just moved in together and I've begun to notice the big differences between our ways of living; I am far more aware of messes than he is, and I know that part of it is because of his ADHD. He leaves condiments out overnight, and will often start tasks without finishing them (we had a pile of cardboard sitting in our living room for almost a week that he insisted he was going to break down). I am doing my best to be understanding, but I can feel myself being resentful on occasion. This morning I went to clean up our kitchen and I was very frustrated because he'd left all the food out after he made himself (a very elaborate) breakfast, and almost every dish we own was dirty.  I love him so so much, but this is one of those problems that we have to address because it festers. I tried to communicate with him today about it, after I had cleaned the kitchen. I made sure to use "I" language, and I told him "I feel like I end up cleaning up after you a lot of the time, because I feel that I am more aware of the messes than you are. I don't know how to solve this problem by myself."  He asked for some space to think about it, and now he's cleaning up our bathroom, and I feel enormously guilty. I don't want him to think I'm angry with him, just frustrated. I'm someone who is very stressed out by mess. Does anyone have any advice for some tips on how to deal with these kinds of problems? I'm so so happy to finally be living with him, and I don't want something this stupid to get to us.
