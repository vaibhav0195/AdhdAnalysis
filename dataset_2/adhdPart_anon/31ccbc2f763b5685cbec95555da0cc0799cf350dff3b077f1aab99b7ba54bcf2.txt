31ccbc2f763b5685cbec95555da0cc0799cf350dff3b077f1aab99b7ba54bcf2;;;I want him taking his adderall;;;My boyfriend is diagnosed with ADHD and has a prescription for adderall but rarely takes it.  I want to ask him to take it because his symptoms are so overwhelming to me and stress me out.  Since I have rarely seen him on it, what effect does adderall have? And does anyone have any advice on how to kindly ask him to take it more often?
