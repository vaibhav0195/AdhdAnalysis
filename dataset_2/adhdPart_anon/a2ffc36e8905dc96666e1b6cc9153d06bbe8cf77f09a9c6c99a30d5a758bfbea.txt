I’ve been seeing a guy a couple months. I think it’s been going great. He usually communicates regularly everyday then FaceTimes me in the evening. He moved about an hour away for work, so we only see each other once a week now.   I’ll admit I don’t know much about ADHD. We’re still dating, I’m doing my best to be a good friend to him and a supportive and caring partner. But last night had me in tears.   I had a truly awful day. Which I’ll say is very rare. I thought he would be a constant, this one thing I wouldn’t have to worry about that day. Instead he just ghosted me. It was like pulling teeth to get him to reply. In the few texts he did send, he said some days he doesn’t have much to say, and added that his mind is like a “tornado” right now trying to figure things out.   Is this normal behavior of an ADHD partner? In the past few months this has never happened. Could someone maybe help me understand?? Please be kind. Thanks.

What are your biggest pieces of advice to give to someone new to this?;;;I’ve (25f) been seeing a man (27m-diagnosed, adderrall) for about 3 months. Already I am seeing challenges. I know with ADHD there’s higher probability for cheating (dopamine - seeking) and divorce. For those of you that have beat the odds how did you do it?

I’m new to this world. I’ve (20’s f) been dating my partner (late 20’s m) for a few months.   I’m an hour away for the time being, so my visits require planning ahead since I take the train.   Twice now, he’s said something along the lines of “I thought you were coming Saturday not Friday” and gotten a tad upset.   We’ve never really fought, we just talk things out.   What can I do to better communicate plans? Should I be discussing plans differently? How can a settle his frustrations?
