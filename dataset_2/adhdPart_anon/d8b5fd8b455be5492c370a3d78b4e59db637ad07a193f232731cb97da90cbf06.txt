How do I help him recognise how well he's done?  He is very clever and has a masters degree and a job he enjoys but feels like he could have done better if he'd been diagnosed sooner. He was diagnosed part way through final year of university, before diagnosis (BD) he struggled with his degree, A levels, and GCSEs - achieving good grades but below what he should have achieved based on ability. After diagnosis, his performance at University increased dramatically. For example, he achieved a 2.1 degree overall but would have been able to get a 1st if he'd been able to perform over the 4 years in the way he could perform with his meds in final year.  He's actually achieved a lot. His ADHD is severe and his grades BD are testament to how hard he worked but he felt he was a lazy person BD and still feels that way sometimes now. He has a job he enjoys and they think highly of him, he has good friends, is well travelled, and has had some athletic success. He devalues these achievements with thoughts of what could have been if he'd been diagnosed sooner and by comparing himself to NT friends who have done better academically and professionally without recognising that they didn't have to fight for a diagnosis and treatment.  I think he's overcome a lot and done very well, but he doesn't see it. How can I help him recognise how well he's done?
