6d645f49b1d7da1cdc5f39db088f06b025b566470116b317643a4d6942ed7b24;;;I’m really down in the dumps;;;I just discovered this reddit! I’m 29, married for 6 years. I have a 9 month baby girl and a kindergartener girl.  When we were on the brink of divorce this past summer, I googled why my marriage failed, and adhd came up. My husband was diagnosed as a kid, but has not been treated since. I didn’t know how much adhd encompassed until I came upon this adhd marriage stuff.  Anyways since our rediscovery, we’ve moved out of my parents place into a new place and started my daughter and our life in our permanent neighborhood. It’s great here!  My husband has been working on his adhd, doing research, he’s tried a couple different meds but he is currently off meds. And I can’t tell if that is why I feel so miserable lately. He’a unresponsive to my concerns, and he thinks I’m trying to control him. I’m just looking for a partner to work together on our budget and saving money, and I feel like I’m by myself. I suggested we give both ourselves a set weekly budget to spend however we see fit. This way I don’t nag him about spending another $8 on a 10th pair of nail clippers because he can’t find a pair and didn’t bother to ask me for help to find them. And so I don’t feel upset when he buys chipotle for the 5th time this week while I’m eating leftovers and ramen. He said he wants to manage it himself. He thinks if I have ANY hand in his actions, that I’m momming him, and it’s going to tank our marriage.  I know some of this stuff is clearly one-sided opinions, and my anger coming out. But I’m just so sad and frustrated. It seemed to be working well these past few months, but these past couple weeks have been unconsiously hard. I just want to feel like I’m not fighting this adhd fight alone and I can’t do it beside my husband. I’m not really sure what I’m looking for. Comments please!
