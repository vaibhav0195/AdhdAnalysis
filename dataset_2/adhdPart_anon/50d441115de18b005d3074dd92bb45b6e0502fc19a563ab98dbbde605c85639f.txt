The amounts of posts I read on here is beyond venting - its scapegoating. Being a neglectful asshole is not a symptom of ADHD.  That post from last week where OP said she'll never date anyone with ADD/ADHD again and the amount of commenters agreeing. That post from yesterday, about being tricked into marrying someone with ADD/ADHD. Your ignorance is disgusting, stop blaming your abusive relationships on one of the most common mental conditions that barely has to do with the traits you describe. ADD/ADHD may amplify those traits, but it is most definitely not the origin.
