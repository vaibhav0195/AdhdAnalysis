b84f80caed5cdee80fdd8a431c29abc8419d931ce21f159aeda12434a657550d;;;Struggling to Continue in this Marriage;;;My husband has adhd and takes vyvanse (when he remembers). I honestly don’t see that it helps much. We’ve been together 8 years now, and I am just exhausted   I’m tired of being his mom. I always have to be on top of everything. We just took an international trip together, and instead of it being a fun, romantic escape, it just felt like I was dragging my kid around. I managed all the transportation details, trip planning, everything. He just had to literally show up. And then I had to wake him every morning or we would waste half a day because he can sleep it away.   He constantly gets things wrong. Even something as simple as a food order. We recently ordered food for pickup online. He put in his order. I put in mine. Handed the computer back for him to complete. He picked up the food and came back and it was all wrong. How???? I literally put in the order myself. Turns out he deleted my portion of the order because he thought he accidentally added an entree (????).   It is this kind of bs nonstop. I can’t even say anything to him about it because he blows up over it. Because he is hearing the same thing from his boss, from me, from his parents. And I’m sure that *is* exhausting and hurtful for him. But I got married to a partner. Not a child. I don’t know how I can carry on. I feel so alone and burdened, knowing it falls on me to not let anything in our lives slip through the cracks.   Our sex life is now basically nonexistent. I don’t know how to say it is hard for me to be physically intimate with someone I have to parent. I don’t know what to do anymore    Has anyone else been here? What did you do?
