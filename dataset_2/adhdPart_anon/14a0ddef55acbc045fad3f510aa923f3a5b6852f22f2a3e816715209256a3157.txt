I took a lot of the advice given in this post so thank you so much to everyone that replied. I also sent him some of the resources, and "How To ADHD" is awesome. I also got myself some resources and will be starting therapy for my own codependency soon.      **TLDR**: Basically the title. Boyfriend's denial and adhd seems to be stopping him from looking into adhd. Thinking of walking away and it's heartbeaking.   My ( F31) boyfriend (M35) was exploring whether he has ADHD and accepted that the probability was very high. I believe he has now hit a denial wall and has stopped looking into it - instead focusing all his attention on projects that I can see he is really struggling to organise. We just had a conversation where I had to tell him that he hasn't paid his rent in a very long time, and has trouble supporting and seeing his son. I didn't want to paint the bleak picture of his life to him. But I feel he is trying to hide from how much he is struggling to adult right now. Things are bad :( and I know he feels ashamed, and I really try to focus on encouraging him with everything he tries to do instead of looking at what doesn't work (because everyone has things that don't work out in life). However I see him making the same mistakes as before with projects - not planning, not costing properly, not thinking about in between steps (just focusing on the end vision), vastly underestimating timelines, not being able to sit down and produce key documents easily, but finding it really easy and energising to talk about things instead.   I have realised that he has not really investigated ADHD seriously since we have talked - he has watched some videos and read some articles, but doesn't want to take the next step. When I asked him what he felt was holding him back, whether maybe ADHD itself was making it difficult to do so, he started talking about how he just wasn't sure, and how it's difficult for him to accept that something like this could be why his life is the way it is, and maybe it's just that he hasn't been doing things right - "and what happens if I don't have ADHD - do I have to start looking for another reason that things don't go well? And we're not 100% so what if I don't have it, and maybe there are other reasons for why things are like this" etc etc. I know this denial may be a phase of grief, but he seems pretty set on this. I feel like he may need to reach a 'rock bottom'. Is that rock bottom me leaving?    I'm now at the point where I feel like I have to just step away from a relationship with someone I love very much. If nothing changed but he was at least willing to face it, and we could work out how to make everyday life better whilst taking adhd into account, then it would be ok. But he won't... it's hard to watch him resist helping himself, and it's hard to try to heal my own codependency in this situation. I feel like an impatient assh\*le.

Not sure how to express this in a non-toxic way - maybe it is toxic.   My (31f) boyfriend (35m) of 2.5years recently came to the realisation that he may have ADHD. FYI, our hustory: We dated for 3 years in uni/20s - broke up. He was then engaged to someone else, they have a child (5m) but that fell apart for some wild reasons (another story for another day).  He is undiagnosed, but he cried when he started looking into ADHD and felt grief over lost time and not knowing sooner. He struggles with attention and focus, many projects started and left unfinished. Took him 12 years and 5 different schools to obtain his degree, but was an academic star in high school (problems with structure? New to this). I am really proud that he kept pushing but when I look back to those early years it is very clear what he was struggling with. People often tell him that they expect so much more from him, that they've always been excited to see what he does with his life. It is depressing for him at times.  His life right now has become quite overwhelming and he lost his mother suddenly 10 months ago, so he is really going through it. He has been "going through  it" for a long time tbh, and I try to support him as best as I can.   He is very intelligent and creative, has an entrepreneurial mindset but unfortunately lack of organisation / follow through etc has meant many  fantastic ideas have never been executed. Therefore he is in an absolute mess financially. He lacks serious debt though, but he has some important obligations he is not taking care of and struggles with rent, child support.   He wants to get married. I love him very much and he has made me into a much better person too - more creative, more confident and he is just great to be around. He isn't defensive. He is always striving. However now seeing things throught the adhd framework, and reading these posts, I really don't know if I should choose this life for myself. I have been very ill for 18 months (but recovering!) And during that time I have been the breadwinner. It doesn't feel good to be honest - I'm not sure why. I guess things feel one sided. We have talked about him giving more attention and being more present etc. I guess i feel like I have to fight to get what I want / need from the relationshop whilst he depends on me. As a relationship when we are always hoping, working and striving for better it seemed bearable. But looking at in terms of marriage, it all feels more serious and I am not sure if I will be able to cope, or be ok with myself making this decision for my life.   He has not sought any treatment, instead focusing on his projects to hopefully yield enough income  to get his life back on track. But it seems the wrong way - he needs to manage his symptoms and learn new behaviours and strategies in order to achieve. I want to tell him that I can't consider us moving forward until he really focuses on this. I feel he won't progress until he does address adhd.  How do I say this in a way that is inspiring, not criticising??? Am I bad person? Maybe I am not tolerant enough?
