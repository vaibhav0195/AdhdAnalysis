Just last night and this morning we were laughing and smiling but this morning, he remembered some bad work news related to money that he was putting off thinking about. I tried talking to him but he just got so angry that he started breaking stuff and even punched a big crack in his car windshield. He always leaves whenever he gets this upset but it still scares me. Two days ago he got into a bad mood and suddenly just left his cooking pan on the stove on high and went to bed and I was in my office. When I finally smelled the smoke and saw him in bed, I got so angry. We have pets, what if it had caught on fire?? Those are the worst of the worst, at best he’ll become overwhelmed with negative emotion and close off/go to bed. It makes me feel so on edge

I tend to be a very obvious hopeless romantic who needs words of affirmation and he tends to show his affection through actions in a very low key manner/not super emotional way. However, whenever we smoke weed (In Canada wheee it’s legal of course), it flips and he becomes very cuddly and talkative towards me, instead of splitting attention like normal. And I become a little more withdrawn. I’d like to know thoughts about this and the adhd brain on weed?

I absolutely adore my adhd boyfriend. He’s ridiculously clever and smart, always has something to say. However, we’ve been together for over a year and more of his quirks have come out, such as:  - leaving dishes in the sink to the pile up until I wash them (which is his job), among general untidiness   - he always needs a project to focus on, while I wish that maybe once a month we could just have a day to stay in and watch movies without any outside interest   - continuous bad money choices  - regular blame of other people in situations, and me trying to help him look at it from other perspectives   - Spontaneous ideas that aren’t thought through, and his desire to go through with them, even when consequences may be high.  -When trying to tell him about something serious to me, he will interrupt with a drawn out story/comment several times. I don’t want to say no, but it makes me feel like what I have to say is less important.  I have a hard time dealing with this. I grew up with a emotionally narcissistic mother, so I really hate feeling like I’m nagging him. I straight up feel horrible.   The more I think about it, the scarier the idea of having children is, even though I’m 19 and he’s 24 and it’s well down the road. We both want a biological child, but sometimes he acts like a kid so much that the idea makes me feel like I would end up with two instead. Especially if the other child also is adhd. Do occurrences such as these become less apparent while on medication? He had just received his medication.  Someone please please please help me. I really do love this man, I’m just trying to makes sense of things.
