d70e1c6516f76a48cbb30d29ff0695c5720faa79af3c2edf78bbbf779b87d6d8;;;Hyperfocus transition to the feeling of being neglected;;;My partner has adhd and I knew it from the very beginning. I noticed the signs and all that even before he told me that he was diagnosed when he was young. After watching several youtube videos, reading up articles all about it, and lurking around here in reddit, here I am.. still honestly can't fully understand him. I used to feel very special because of him.. but as soon as he got comfortable in the relationship, I often feel like he's become too "carefree". There are times when I feel like I'm too understanding towards him. I try my best not to pinpoint or to sound like I'm nagging him whenever I'd vent out towards him about me feeling neglected in the relationship. Most often times, I feel like I'm the man in our relationship (not being sexist or what). The venting out doesn't come too often because I know the conversation would not go well or we would agree to this or that and he'd adhere to my concern just for a brief period.  I'm just really here to release my disappointment but also probably hoping for any advice on igniting that flare that we used to have. I also get hurt whenever I do call him out about these things. He already feels incapable but I also do know he's trying so hard balancing his attention and consistency towards different things. There's a lot of self-doubt that would come into mind. Questions like, "am I getting too boring for him?", "am I not special enough?".  For those who are in this position or have gotten used and faced the situation, how did you guys handle it or how are you guys handling it? I'm talking about the hyper focus of our adhd partners then the transition to when the hyper focus has died down. Any advice or help would be appreciated. Thanks ya'll.
