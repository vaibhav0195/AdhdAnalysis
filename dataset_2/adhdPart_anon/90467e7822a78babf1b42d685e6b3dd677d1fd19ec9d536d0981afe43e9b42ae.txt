90467e7822a78babf1b42d685e6b3dd677d1fd19ec9d536d0981afe43e9b42ae;;;Choosing;;;We are thinking about adding another animal to our family and I am more excited about it than my husband. We have been talking about it and he wanted to see some numbers on how much it would cost for all of the things we would need for this animal. I put it all together and wanted to show him tonight. I asked him if I could show him and he asked if we could do it tomorrow because had to do some updates tonight and he wanted to play a game with his friend (who he had been playing with all day) and wasn't able to give my thing the attention he wanted to give it. I'm glad that he recognized this but why did he choose to play with his friend instead of looking at my thing that would take all of 10 minutes. It hurts that he chose his video game and friend over me. Am I overreacting or should I just be happy that he recognized that he wasn't able to give me his full attention?
