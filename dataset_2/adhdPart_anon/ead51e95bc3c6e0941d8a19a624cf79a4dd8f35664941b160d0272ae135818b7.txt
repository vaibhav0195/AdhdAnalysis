He's very open about his ADHD (DX and medicated), how he's feeling etc. I've done loads of research about it since we've been together, as I want to be as supportive as possible and his ADHD is a part of what makes him, him. It's been a steep learning curve in some respects; I've adapted when he gets hyperfocussed on things. It's weird trying to not let it get to me when he ignores me for hours at a time because he's hyperfocussed, but I've learnt to do my own stuff during that time. Sometimes he gets easily distracted on the phone and I'll either go with the flow or bring him back to the conversation. He's also the most creative, interesting, insightful and kind hearted person I have ever met. He boggles my mind and I love it.  However, one thing that I'm struggling to get used to... he's SUPER blunt. I knew this about him when we first got together, but he just doesn't sugarcoat things and it can be jarring sometimes. I love his frank and honest nature, but I wish he was a little softer with certain things. I've spoken to him about it before and he has tried, but sometimes he still does it.  I'm just wondering if anyone has any advice on getting used to the bluntness? Which sounds silly now that I type it, but sometimes my feelings get hurt, right before I realise he's just being blunt, not rude.
