14acecc87fab2748e0c5a356e676f091fca6f696ab39feb362ca4c573ca49c88;;;Calling all parents with unmedicated partners;;;My [34F] husband [32M] has ADHD and does not take medication nor wants to. All of the little inconvenient things that used to impact our relationship have become much more impactful now that we have our first child [1M] because they now affect our child and family unit more significantly. So my question is, how have you coped with this? How have you maintained your serenity when dealing in this dynamic? What changes have you implemented? How have you communicated about it?   I should mention that I believe he knows his shortcomings and is probably scared because he doesn’t seem to want to participate in care taking. He will hang out with me and our son, but he has guided our dynamic to a place when I take on most of the care—to the point that we (I) have to seek out a babysitter just to do something small like go to a quick appointment. Anyone with experience with this too, please share! We are both high earning individuals but he has an incredible job at the moment that doesn’t even allow me to justify going back to work (luxury problem I know). I’ll also note that this incredible job is NOT demanding of him time-wise and he acknowledges that openly.
