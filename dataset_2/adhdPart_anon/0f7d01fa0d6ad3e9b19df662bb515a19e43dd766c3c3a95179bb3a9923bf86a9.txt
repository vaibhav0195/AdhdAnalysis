We've been together 9 years, married 5. We have a 4 year old and a 1 year old. We've already separated once, 2 years ago, and that was when he was eventually diagnosed. He was going to therapy and stopped as soon as we reconciled. He is on medication, but hasn't followed up with learning any coping or life skills. His behaviour is very typical so I won't detail it all, but being married to him is very lonely, I feel the weight of the world on my shoulders, and I feel very unloved. My biggest issues (out of the many) are the constant criticism and that he doesn't care to spend time with me or be intimate with me (he would rather drink by himself every night and sleep on the couch than be with me, he doesn't kiss or hug me or hold my hand or sit next to me, never initiates sex... you get the point). The most recent breaking point is when he punched a hole in the wall in the kitchen because he was mad while our 1 year old was sitting in the high chair.  I go between feeling numb and so so sad. I feel like I've been begging someone to love me, to just be nice to me, for almost a decade. I don't want our daughters to have to grow up with their mom and dad not together, but also don't want them to grow up in a house with constant conflict and thinking that the way their dad treats me is the way their husbands should treat them.  I really feel like, even though I don't want to, divorce is the only way to bring us all peace. Is it possible to have a fulfilling and loving marriage? Or is this just the way it is? How do I decide?
