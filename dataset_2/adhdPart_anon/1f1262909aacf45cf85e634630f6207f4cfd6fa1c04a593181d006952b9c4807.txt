When he wants to talk he is very intense and loving and very sweet, but then the next week he won't respond to me for a couple days and then ask for "space." He has done this about three times and I am getting frustrated. He says he has adhd and is unmedicated and I think has some issues controlling his emotions. I really like him but I don't know how many times I can handle him just disappearing on me. When we talk he basically acts like we are married, and then just ghosts me out of nowhere. His last partner did die after a long relationship so that may have some influence on this as well. I don't know what to do, as I really really care for him I just can't handle be tossed aside so frequently.
