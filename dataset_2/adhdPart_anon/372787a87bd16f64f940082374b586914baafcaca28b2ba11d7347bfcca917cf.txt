So, I won't give much information.  There is a girl (I'll call her Nancy here) I know for a while now. In the beginning, I quickly liked her and I wanted to ask her out, but when I was about to ask her out, she told me about her condition (she didn't notice my intention). Nancy has ADHD and it seems serious (I don't know even if seriousness is defined for ADHD or all cases are almost the same).  After some time and some events, we got really close. I have feelings for her and I can say she has for me. I can't stay in this state anymore. I am hurting us both by keeping us in this situation.  Recently, I met another girl (I'll call her Emma) and I have a really good feeling if I ask her out, she would say yes. I am not typically wrong about these things. I barely know Emma and I kind of like her. But asking Emma out would kill my chance with Nancy.  Excluding ADHD, Nancy is just perfect in every way I can imagine. Not just because I like her very much because she just is perfect. But, ADHD really affects her life. I don't know if she knows, but many things she blames herself for them, are actually very common symptoms of ADHD. I know we would fall in love deeply if we start a relationship tomorrow.  I read a lot about the challenges of having a relationship with someone with ADHD like it can start amazing, but it will wear off harder than typical relationships. Still, I can't say what would happen to us and how hard it would be.  My question is, given your experience, what would you do if you were me? I completely know it is easier than done but I don't want to decide based on sentiments. I have always been proud of myself for making important decisions while considering the long run.
