I'm still learning what that means to me, so much of it was just my normal until someone told me it wasn't.   My partner (25F DX Medicated) is a bit of a disaster. Unemployed with no desire to change that. All she does is play video games. No schedule for sleep, food, meds. A glimpse into the life: we have divided our bedroom into "sides" so I can keep mine tidy and "just not look" at the mess on the other side. (Yeah, she got the closet - I get the drawers under the bed. An award for being tidy enough to keep my things in two drawers?)   I'm a go-getter. I'm on top of things, usually three steps ahead of them. I like to have every moment of my day neatly arranged and balanced correctly. I think that's why my relationship worked so well in the past. But lately the nonsense is piling up, and I have too much to juggle, and I'm dropping balls, and everything my partner does sets me off. I find myself resenting her, like, why do I have to bend over backwards memorizing every detail of her month and picking up after her if she can't even respect some of my major triggers? She leaves food to rot on "her side" of the bedroom and I spend a week in a spiral of being massively triggered but simultaneously in a guilt spiral for finding it / wrestling with whether or not I'm just going to clean it up myself.  TLDR Has anyone been in an OCD/ADHD relationship before, or have any tips?
