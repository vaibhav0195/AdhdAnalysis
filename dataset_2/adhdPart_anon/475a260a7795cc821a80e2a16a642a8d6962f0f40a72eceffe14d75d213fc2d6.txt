I am ADHD and medicated living with a non ADHD partner and while I know they love and care about me; I also know they are getting to a tipping point.   I do my best to listen to what they tell me they need and internalize those things. It is however really difficult.  They do so much work trying to understand what ADHD is like, and why I do things like hyper focus or forget I am in the middle of something and leave it mid task. They are starting to understand but I need to do my part.   I want so badly to do my part and I am seeing a therapist, but ADHD is a curse that way. It's very difficult to work on your ADHD because you have ADHD. It's all the standard issues.  * I can't stay on task doing research, and working on me * The extreme guilt associated with the above * Exhaustion from the emotional energy it takes me to stay mindful for half of the time at best  * Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria  I know they are frustrated and I completely understand why how frustrating living with me can be.   There absolutely are other compounding factors, and I know its not simple at all... but what are some things you need to see from your partners?   What things could we do that would show that we are really trying, that we care, that we are as frustrated with ourselves as you are with us?  I feel lost and scared that I can't be what my partner needs, and wanted to get some partner perspectives.
