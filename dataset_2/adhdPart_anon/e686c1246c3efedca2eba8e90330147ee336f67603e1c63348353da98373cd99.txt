e686c1246c3efedca2eba8e90330147ee336f67603e1c63348353da98373cd99;;;DX Husband of 3 years has trouble waking up on his own in the morning.;;;Writing this as I have LOADS of time before work today because my husband "forgot he set up a new alarm" that makes him solve a math problem before it turns off, and thought 5:30am was the normal time we wake up.  It's never been 5am anything. My watch is set at 6:45.  I feel like he just doesn't think or at least not about my needs, and it feels so incredibly selfish to me. Before he takes his medication he is INCREDIBLY irritable and has issues with sensory processing that he's been working on in therapy. Mornings are rough.  Forcing yourself to solve a problem while the loudest alarm in the world is going off is not ideal for sensory processing... I had to yell the number to him because he was on the couch trying to restart his phone or turn it off, but the app locked until he put the number in. Ended with both of us yelling. Him at the phone, me at him. :(  A normal morning he'll wake up as I'm getting ready or I wake him up around 7:30 "XXX, you're going to be late" and find him on the couch where he passed out after fighting insomnia with snacks (still left out, of course). When I tell him he should probably get up he starts stomping around because he's "mad his alarms didn't go off" (They did. He just sleeps through them.) and is quick to fight, with me, even with the sink last week because it didn't turn on right.  Mornings have been a recurring fight for us lately. Do I just need to find some way of moving my routine up and just leaving him in the house? I know he needs to fail, so that my be the case I'm just frustrated I don't get a break (cannot sleep in for my job sometimes).  I struggle with him like this because mornings are pretty sacred for me and I like to take my time to do my routine and set a tone for the day.  Tired. Help.  Any tips we can use to have better mornings?
