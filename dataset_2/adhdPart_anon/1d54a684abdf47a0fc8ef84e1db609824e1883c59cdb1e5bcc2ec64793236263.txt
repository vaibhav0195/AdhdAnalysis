1d54a684abdf47a0fc8ef84e1db609824e1883c59cdb1e5bcc2ec64793236263;;;On again off again relationship. ADHD or just a dick?;;;I (26)F, have been in a year long emotional rollercoaster with a (31)F. Our relationship has always been very emotionally intense, we fell for each other very quickly. She told me she had ADHD very soon after getting to know each other but it was treated more as a joke as she has a big goofy personality and she plays it off well. She has never been diagnosed or gotten any help with it but it’s very clear that’s what she struggles with. Her moods are very extreme, she takes big risks, doesn’t know how to stay still and is always planning her next move because she needs to stay stimulated. Now for the most part I am very patient, but I take her impulsive thoughts and behaviours very personal and that’s what leads to our biggest fights/break ups.   We were slowly feeling out our relationship again after she told me she was in love with me and begged for me to be with her again, I told her my concerns of not trusting her as she is very flakey and commitment makes her freak out and I’ve been hurt by her before but nevertheless I’m the love with the woman so I fell back into her. Cue to last night, she hasn’t been in a very good headspace lately (COVID and lockdowns makes her feel very trapped) and told me she wants to move out of the country and didn’t know if she could do this relationship with me, I obviously took this very personal and got very upset. But now I’m sat here im starting to realise this might be a reaction because of her ADHD? The need to run? Does anyone else’s partners struggle with commitment/relationships etc? I need some insight because this is the first time ever looking into it.
