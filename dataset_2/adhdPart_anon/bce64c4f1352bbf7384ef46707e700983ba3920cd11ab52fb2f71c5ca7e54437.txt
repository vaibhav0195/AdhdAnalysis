bce64c4f1352bbf7384ef46707e700983ba3920cd11ab52fb2f71c5ca7e54437;;;I think my relationship is ending;;;My boyfriend thinks he has ADHD but is undiagnosed. After almost two and a half years together I don't think I can handle the fighting any more. Feeling alone in this relationship. Feeling ignored. Feeling like their is no building a relationship. Only this moment matters, nothing in the past matters because he might not remember. Feeling gaslighted.  Today I told him I think we both need some space. I've been crying a lot because I feel almost like it's already over. He's playing video games with his friends.
