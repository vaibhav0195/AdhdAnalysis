ce54ae9fd221100e5849fc80bed2787ecdf182f18c1bd950cc05f80cb7bcf700;;;Where do I begin?;;;My mind is a mess.I don't even know who I am anymore. I'm angry, resentful and bitter.  My husband told me of his childhood adhd, but told me he grew out of it. How stupid am I to have believed it.   Fast forward 8 years, our marriage is fucked.   My husband is feeling positive about his new diagnosis. He says it's given him the chance to work on himself for our family.  He's on meds, seeing a therapist, meditating, exercising, writing notes.   So why do I want to run away more than ever? Why does it feel worse now there is a reason for the years of hurt and pain.   I'm tired of trying to be patient. I'm tired of being the one to keep everything together. I'm barely holding everything together myself.   While you're out working on getting yourself better, I'm stuck at home with our child, still picking up the pieces from the shit storm from the past 8 years.   This diagnosis has bought you relief. This diagnosis has bought me reality. Reality our child could potentially have adhd. That the rest of my life is going to revolve around a disorder that I don't have.   I'm a strong woman but this has broken me down beyond what I can handle alone.   How does one move past years of anger, resentment, and pain. Years of unwanted memories.   God I just want to run. But I can't. I'm stuck. I feel hopeless. I want these thoughts to just stop.   I just want to be happy again.
