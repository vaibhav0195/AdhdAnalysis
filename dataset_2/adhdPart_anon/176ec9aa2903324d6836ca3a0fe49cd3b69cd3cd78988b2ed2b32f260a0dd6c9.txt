As weâ€™re scrolling through his phone, I see this photo of a beautiful purple flower and I ask him about it.  Apparently, he just randomly felt like going for a walk in the morning (he never wants to go for a walk...) when he sees this flower and picked it for me. (This was early in the morning, btw, when we would not have seen each other for another 10 hours.) He then tells me that after he picked it, he got tired of holding it and wanted to climb a tree instead. So, he nestled the flower among some leaves and because it looked so pretty, he took a photo of it.  Then he proceeds to show me photos of the tree he climbed like he did not just completely melt my heart in every single way.  ADHD can be a pain in the ass, especially when it comes to day-to-day stuff, but sometimes, I really really cherish it too. Everything about this story exemplifies why I love him so much and if he did not have ADHD, I very much doubt his morning adventure would ever have happened.  Anyone else have similar stories of ADHD love to share?
