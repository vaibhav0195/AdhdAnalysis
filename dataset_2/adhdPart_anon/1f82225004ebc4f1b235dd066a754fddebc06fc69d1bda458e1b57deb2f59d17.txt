It’s very new, just a few months in but it started out so intensely that we felt such a strong connection and reached a lot of milestones in a short amount of time. We got to know each other extremely well and bonded over lots of common interests and even common values and life goals.   However, the last few weeks I’ve noticed a change in his behavior towards me. At the start of the relationship he was very affectionate and attentive. It’s like what some of these articles about ADHD and relationships often say - I felt like I was the “center of his universe.”   He is still very nice to me and spends a lot of time with me, but I feel like he’s more detached and isn’t as interested in me as he was before. I brought it up with him and he said that his feelings for me haven’t changed, but I still feel hurt because of the change in the level of attentiveness and affection.   Has anyone else been in the same position? What was your experience like? Any advice on how to process it and what to do about it?
