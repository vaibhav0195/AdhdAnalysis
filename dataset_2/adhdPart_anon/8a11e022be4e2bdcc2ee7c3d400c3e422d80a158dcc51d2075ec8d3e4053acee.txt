She got on medication almost right away. She says my tone is important, the way I speak is important, that I don't do anything without being asked, that she is managing me. She says I am half in conversations, I'd agree I can't listen well I want it written down I forget a lot of things.  "No individual is their behaviors you can change your behaviors" she says.  She's pushing me toward therapy and medication, I didn't really enjoy therapy, I spent a lot of time in therapy in my youth. She's pushing me toward taking medication and I had tried it before, I'd only want to use it for focusing on work and studying but she wants it to be a whole day thing so I can be the best boyfriend.  It seems really weird to me, it doesn't feel right and I wonder what your take is on this? I just want to live freely and be in an organic relationship without the weight of all these expectations. These conversations are the worst part of my day and they are frequent.  In general I am happy and successful, but it brings me down. It really drags me way down.  So yeah I don't know, what do you think?
