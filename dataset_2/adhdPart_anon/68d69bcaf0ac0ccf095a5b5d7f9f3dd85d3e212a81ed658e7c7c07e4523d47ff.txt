I have 8 weeks before a big event in my life - moving country.  I promised my partner I would get a second job to help finance it. That was 8 months ago...Currently he is taking all the responsibility.  I keep trying to plan and organise myself to do it. And then..I don't  I don't feel the sense of urgency. I know it's urgent. But I don't feel the urgency. I think to myself if I don't do this I risk losing him....and then I do something else. Each day is like a day dream.  I don't want to lose my partner to this illness! I feel like a fool every day.  I keep saying I need a really strict schedule. Something that does not allow me to do something else.   He says... You've tried this many times before and you don't follow it... It's true - because I forget it exists.  I get distracted by basic things like a coffee cup, a sound, etc and that will result in HOURS of wandering about. If I get up from my desk, I might not come back to it. Everything in my immediate view seems equally as important. i know it's not... Ii know I'm distracted.... But I then I try to self correct.. to walk back to my desk, and then I forget what I am doing. I feel like I have dementia but I'm only in my 30s  How do you help your partners? Does anyone have a strategy ? A system?  I'm running out of time. And I desperately need a SOLLUTION.  I'm asking partners of those with ADHD because I know you get to see this illness affect your partners and I wonder if you have systems that work?  Thanks
