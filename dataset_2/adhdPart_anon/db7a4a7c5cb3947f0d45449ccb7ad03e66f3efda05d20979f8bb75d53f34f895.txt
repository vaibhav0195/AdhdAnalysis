How we adapt in our home, relationship, etc. In addition to all that, I think this mentality of meeting them where they are is harmful in more ways even to the adhd partner themselves.   My husband (dx) hasn’t been able to hold a job for more than 6 months at a time. He’s at his current company for a bit over 4 months. He likes his employer, but up until last week he was “working” from home (bare minimum effort, playing video games). Last week he got a promotion. Similar work, higher pay, requires coming into the office a few times a week. All hell broke loose. What should be celebrated is somehow a huge issue.   Today, after one week of the new position, he met with his boss to tell him he wants to go back to the other team. His boss said no. So now he’s still at work, all mad, and texting me telling me that if he doesn’t get demoted he will “force his hand by not doing any work at all” (his words). I told him if he does that he will lose his job. He doesn’t care.   I’m stressed as hell. I’m still not back at work. The lack of stability is stressful. His rage from the situation is stressful. And I can’t help but think about how people with adhd are so used to getting what they want and people bending over backwards for them that they can’t be told no. They can’t adjust even in situations like work where you NEED to adapt to keep a roof over your head. No, the delusion is that if they don’t get what they want the first time, they will try to manipulate it into happening.  Adhd doesn’t just exist in a bubble at home. Society setting expectations for us to step in where they can’t just enables it in other settings. I wish this wasn’t the norm.
