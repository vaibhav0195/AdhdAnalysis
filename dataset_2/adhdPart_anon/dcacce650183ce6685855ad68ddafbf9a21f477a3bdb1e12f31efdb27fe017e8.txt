Reading through the posts here, I finally feel like my feelings are valid..   My (23F) boyfriend (26M) has not been diagnosed yet, but he has his appointment in a few days. We have been together for about 3 years, and we are living together since last September. He shows typical ADHD symptoms, that just DRIVE ME CRAZY. I just thought that he didn't learn how to take care of himself as a child, since his mom did literally everything for him. Since we live together, sometimes I got to that point that I just can't do it anymore, I'm tired of arguing about chores, about his impulsive spending and just overall, that I am doing everything on my own. At this point is okay, since I’m at home all the time, but just like others in here, I am afraid, what if we had kids? or just the future in general?... I can’t possibly take care of everything, I need him as a partner, not like a child to be taken care of....  So my question is... Does medication and therapy actually helps?? I have reached my breakinf point, and I would love to know, if there is any hope that things can get better...
