Last night, I asked him if he got his gift. No. The conversation went like this:  Him: nobody told me, I didn’t know.  Me: you were there and involved in the conversation when we all decided together. I’ve also spoken to you about it at least 4x since.  Him: nope, that definitely didn’t happen. How could it have if I don’t remember?  This leads to me getting more and more angry and feeling super let down. I know that this is a pretty classic ADHD situation but I just feel I need some responsibility and an apology from him, but I can’t seem to ask for that without getting angry due to his defensiveness.   It’s just hard with Christmas because I have done all of the organising, choosing; buying and wrapping presents including for my step son (his son) which I am happy to do but it just feels like I’m propping the world up on my shoulders for him sometimes.   Sorry - this turned into a real vent, but TLDR: what’s the best way to respond to a classic ADHD let down situation to avoid both parties feeling angry?
