c9baecf611aaa6730c44e21820eb4684b57a316000093e7e2d085ac5ba816c5b;;;For those whose partners didn't disclose their ADHD, how did you find out?;;;Assuming they weren't diagnosed when you met. What made you think there was something else going on, and how did you start your search?
c9baecf611aaa6730c44e21820eb4684b57a316000093e7e2d085ac5ba816c5b;;;In what ways do you support your partner?;;;Is it by doing the finances and paperwork, putting up post it notes for reminders, repeating that one thing you said for a 3rd time without losing your cool, scheduling his diagnose appointment, or just those household chores he/she hates?  And is it something you can keep doing in the long run?
c9baecf611aaa6730c44e21820eb4684b57a316000093e7e2d085ac5ba816c5b;;;Where we stand as a community;;;There was a recent post questioning the input of the ADHD side and us having a place where we feel safe and heard, to some these two are not compatible. What seemed like a simple request is in fact fairly complex and us mods have discussed this to see what's reasonable, feasible and in the long run beneficial to this community.  &amp;#x200B;  **To the partners and family members (NT aswell as ADHD) that come here asking for advice about their ADHD loved ones:**   You are the core part of this sub, this place is intended to support, validate and provide information to you in the first place. We realise a big part of you have been hurt by your loved ones and have built up  alot of resentment.   **Let us remind you that if you want to vent without your concerns and feelings being invalidated, rationalised, dismissed or in any form disrespected;** ***use the Weekly Vent Thread.***    **We will keep a very close eye on this to make sure this safe space is respected.**     **If you seek advice and feedback from the community, it will remain an open dialogue between NT and ADHD perspective.** Both sides can add valuable perspective and information and need to be  heard when it's done in a respectful manner and when it comes from a place of understanding and accountability. We would be doing ourselves a disservice to exclude the very people we're talking about. It's a slippery slope to alienating and polarising both sides.   Not everyone has the same level of knowledge on this, that's why we're working behind the screens on a more extended [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD_partners/wiki/index). It's a fairly big task, so hang in there as we're sorting through reputable sources and fleshing things out.  &amp;#x200B;  **To the ADHD partners:**   Those that contribute with valuable feedback and information, thank you. It's not always easy venturing on this side of the fence. Those of you that have made progress in your relationship and handling of the condition can provide a great help to those that haven't with a unique perspective we as non-ADHD cannot always provide.   Those that find it difficult and feel the need to defend themselves or cause a stir: maybe this isn't the place for you. Keep in mind that the content here **is not a personal attack.** You are all individuals  with a varying combination of symptoms of the same disorder, mixed in with different personality styles. This doesn't mean the concerns displayed here are invalid.    “But I can't help it” type of comments will be removed, so basically comments that display not taking responsibility for yourself. Same goes for comments that invalidate an OP's concern just because you as an individual don't portray described behaviour. If you have serious doubts as to why the subject at hand has nothing to do with ADHD, provide resources and arguments.  &amp;#x200B;  This leads us to: **the report button**   This is a very useful tool in maintaining the quality of this sub. Please use it. This sub gets checked multiple times per day so us mods can intervene when necessary. As the report button options might not have been appropriate in the past for the misconduct, we have added a new rule: **no invalidation, no disrespect**. Use it with integrity and try to see the other person's perpective first before reporting.      If you have any questions or remarks, let us know in the comments.

After years of riding this rollercoaster,  holding this small bundle of papers in my hand gives such peace of mind, and a chance to leave a lot of misunderstanding and negativity behind us.  &amp;#x200B;  ^(Hooray my S.O. is ADHD-PI!)  I'm gonna grab myself a glass of wine to celebrate!
c9baecf611aaa6730c44e21820eb4684b57a316000093e7e2d085ac5ba816c5b;;;We've grown to 2000 subscribers!;;;Hi ladies and gentlemen,  We've grown to 2000 subscribers and that needs to be celebrated!  I want to thank you for helping setting the tone for this place; where different opinions can be expressed as we genuinely believe it adds to a richer soundingboard, and being respectful about it.  I also want to thank you for enriching this community with your advice and anecdotes,    and when nothing else can be said, your words of comfort and understanding when needed the most.  That being said, let's keep it short and sweet.    Glad to have you on board! Carry on :)

I consulted 2 psychologists for myself, before we reached breaking point and almost split. We agreed to do some couples counseling, and I told my therapist about my suspicions of ADHD. We got this standard home assignment to fill out a questionnaire for eachother, one that would improve our communication. "How do you like to spend time with eachother, how much time would you like to spend with eachother, how do you prefer to show you love him/her?" But she totally dismissed the elephant in the room and said ADHD wasn't the issue, we should just learn to listen to eachother. Ha.   Well after that I had to start again from zero, I mean how would I know better than a certified specialist? I was starting to think maybe it was me, I'm a little crazy. You know, one of those people that would wanna call someone sick so they can then take care of, or fix. But this wasn't my first long relationship, and those before were sure not like this.  A year later we reached breaking point again, for all the textbook ADHD reasons. So I scheduled an appointment with an ADHD specialist center and it was kinda bittersweet to hear he checked most of the boxes. Thank you internet, and all the people that shared their sometimes very relatable stories!
c9baecf611aaa6730c44e21820eb4684b57a316000093e7e2d085ac5ba816c5b;;;Welcome!;;;First of all, welcome to this new subreddit!  I hope this place scratches an itch for some people who have been looking for something similar.  I know I've been searching all over the internet, scrambling bits and pieces of information together.  Roaming the [ADHD subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/ADHD/) for quite a while, there seemed a need for those living with an ADHD partner to have a place of their own.  Hopefully we can gather a community for the sometimes much needed support, and I bet that there are a few veterans that can teach us non-ADHD partners some insight.
c9baecf611aaa6730c44e21820eb4684b57a316000093e7e2d085ac5ba816c5b;;;A welcome to our new mods;;;As some of you already may have noticed, the modding team has 2 new additions.   They've been active members for a while now, and as we keep growing they'll help shape this supportive community.  So a big welcome to u/beugly and u/SherrifOfNothingtown!
c9baecf611aaa6730c44e21820eb4684b57a316000093e7e2d085ac5ba816c5b;;;Announcement;;;I see a lot of frustrations floating around in the form of vent-posts, and they are most likely justified. Some of you are familiar here and have stated in the past why their frustrations are related to ADHD, so they don't need to re-introduce their circumstances everytime. However, I have noticed this tendency has been picked up by newcomers that leave us  guessing the relevance of their concerns to this ADHD focused subreddit.  Therefore the rules secxtion will have an addition:  \*\*I will ask you to make a brief statement in the beginning of your post wether your S.O./friend/relative has been diagnosed or not, just written as DX or NDX will do just fine.\*\*     In addition, we'll soon be rolling out a weekly vent-thread where you can write off your frustrations. This will be tested for a few weeks, with the intent to make room for a more constructive debate regarding our loved ones.

Barkley: The Importance of Emotion in Understanding and Managing ADHD;;;I've come across some in depth lectures from Russell A. Barkley, explaining the process of how emotions work within ADHD. Keep in mind: it's written for professionals, so the content is pretty "dry", but I personally found the *willpower fueltank* diagram pretty interesting. It explains how selfregulatory strength, the ability to control strong emotions, is a limited resource pool. There are things that deplete that pool, and there are things that replenish it (you can skip to 1:29:43 for this part).  For those that don't mind the theory, he also talks about how emotional disregulation has been a part of the core diagnosis of ADHD in the past (DSM), and how it shifted to comorbidities such as ODD (oppositional defiant disorder).
