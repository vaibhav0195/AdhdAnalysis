5df0798f8da48e6b1fcbf2d262acd0f836a4fceb55701bb52e8a59e1303ecab0;;;Planning a wedding;;;I am struggling here trying to plan a wedding during a pandemic with my ADD partner. We cancelled our original plans to do a backyard wedding. Every conversation seems to start from scratch and he “doesn’t remember” any previous agreements. He likes to be in charge of most situations but isn’t able to follow through on tasks such as checking guest lists and vendors, so after months I am forced to move forward on decisions after waiting til the last minute. He said he would rather pay someone to “deal with all this” than listen to my suggestions. I have tried to have conversations and truly ask him if waiting till next year or in the future would be make him happier, we have been together almost 10 years, so what’s the difference. However he insists that we move forward. Whenever he tries to help, he gets overwhelmed and it sets us back to the beginning. We aren’t going to have our dream 200 person destination wedding. I understand he’s upset and so am I. We agreed to make the most of our situation. He said he doesn’t listen to or remember what I say in terms of planning and logistics, so he wants to pay someone to do it for us. I’m worried that this is a terrible start to the marriage. I’m currently chalking this up to wedding stress, pandemic, adhd, etc but am I ignoring red flags here??
