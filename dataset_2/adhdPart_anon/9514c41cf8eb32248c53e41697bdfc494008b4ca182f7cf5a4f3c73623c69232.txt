9514c41cf8eb32248c53e41697bdfc494008b4ca182f7cf5a4f3c73623c69232;;;Worried about parenting/venting about other stuff;;;My fianc√© has inattentive ADHD, so he is extremely forgetful and often loses things. So far, I've found ways to cope with this; ie. designated places for his phone/wallet/keys to go as soon as he comes home; grocery list app that syncs to his phone. It's still frustrating when he forgets to buy things we need (even when they're on the grocery list!! argh) or doesn't seem to pay attention to me. Most recently he forgot to make reservations for Valentine's Day dinner, although I've reminded him every day for the past 2 weeks. I struggle with depression and PTSD (mostly well controlled with medication), but it often feels like there's no room for my emotions. He feels excessively guilty about all this, so anytime I voice how I'm feeling, it just turns into me supporting him through his guilt spiral. All this said, we love each other deeply and I try to remind myself that his ADHD is a problem we're tackling together. /endrant  Lately we've been planning when to have our future children. I don't get too worked up when he forgets things now; it's just inconvenient or mildly annoying. But I'm growing worried how this will impact our future kids. I am on a very demanding career path, so much of the day-to-day childcare will fall to him. I worry about him forgetting to pick up the kids from school, forgetting to feed the baby, accidentally leaving the baby in a car, missing their doctor's appointments, etc etc etc. Does anyone else here have kids with an inattentive ADHD spouse? I don't know how to deal with these fears.
