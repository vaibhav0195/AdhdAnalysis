We have a cleaner coming over today and so last night I had asked my husband to do the pile of dishes by the sink that we had. My work load has been lighter, so I have been taking it upon myself to handle most of the house chores. Last night, I decided that I wanted a little break so I asked my husband to handle the dishes.  Well, this morning I go around the house to do a once over and see if there's anything easy I can clean so that the cleaners can focus more on detailing rather than like...picking up dirty paper towels off the table....aaaand I notice there are still some dishes in the sink.  Not the end of the world! I can just put away the clean dishes really quickly and refill the washer.   ...I wouldn't be posting here if it wasn't a big deal. I opened the dish washer, and low and behold...dishes were just thrown in with food crusted, caked on. Dough sticking to the utensils...nothing had been even rinsed before being put in there. I found a mug with an entire TEA BAG still in it.   Now I have to redo all those dishes and hand wash whatever doesn't fit. I'm just...tired. I cried for about 5 minutes over the disrespect that I'm feeling from this. My husband came out and immediately wanted to fix it, but I just am over it and he has a lot of work to do today. I just want to ask for something to get done and have confidence that it's not going to look like someone doing chores for the first time did it the next day.
