01cd993df637d362a619c7249488f5edbb070b5f420351f848eb967de2d077b0;;;Treatment options?;;;My DX boyfriend who I live with has previously been on Adderall but stopped bc of its addictive qualities. He both loved the way it made him feel and hated it at the same time bc he continued to need a higher dose, had trouble sleeping, etc. He has admitted that he feels depressed and like he might need something to help him concentrate but is scared of going back on Adderall. Where should we start? Has anyone else experienced this and had success with an alternative treatment? Thank you in advance.
