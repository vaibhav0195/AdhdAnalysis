My partner was told last week By her counseller that she thinks my partner may have adhd.  She is going to peruse a diagnosis when she sees her family dr at the end of the month but I have been reading up on this and damn .  I feel like things have been wrong for so long and after reading up on the topic I feel like all the red flags are there .  The avoidance , the weird care dynamics in the relationship , the strange emotions , the hyper focusing .  I’m really struggling with this as I’m sure she is but it makes me wonder if this relationship will ever work .  I’m not sure what I’m looking for here but if anyone has any advice I would gladly listen . Thanks !
