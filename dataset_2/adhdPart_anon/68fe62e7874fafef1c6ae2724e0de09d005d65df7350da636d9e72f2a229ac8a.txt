68fe62e7874fafef1c6ae2724e0de09d005d65df7350da636d9e72f2a229ac8a;;;Question about Assigned Flair;;;Why is this subreddit assigning me flair without my input? On top of how innapropriate that is, their choice is.... rather incomplete, to put it mildly. I've messaged the mods about this, but it definitely feels like a consent violation and putting words in my mouth. If the lack of flair is an issue they were certainly free to ask me to change it.  &amp;#x200B;  I am open about my ADHD diagnoses here (and about the diagnoses of the person who is still my legal spouse )  but that hardly gives someone else permission to label my posts with a warning that I have a neurodevelopmental disorder without my input. It's also noteworthy that the choice they made was DX, not Ex-partner of DX, when both are true.   This is exactly as inappropriate as if the mods decided to add a label that said "Lesbian" to each of my posts - equally true, would be fine with my consent, but absolutely, wildly, out of bounds to do without it.
