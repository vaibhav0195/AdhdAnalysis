I don't feel the most comfortable taking them out to use the bathroom at night as we don't have our own private yard, just a front yard. He knows this so he has taken the responsibility of taking them out for the last time before bedtime. Problem is that he goes to bed after me, and I wake up in the middle of the night to realize he has not taken out the dogs (I'm a light sleeper and would be woken up if he did). This results in me either having to wake him up multiple times from his stupor, which causes an angry reaction, only to either have him pass out again or I end up having to take the dogs out myself. So I end up having to take the dogs out at a time thats even more uncomfortable for me (it's 1:30am right now). He refuses to take them out earlier, it's always "I'll take them out before I go to bed" or "when I finish this game" (on his xbox). He's aware of this pattern and still isn't doing anything about it.   If I just try to take them out myself it makes him angry, so I end up taking them out after I realize he's fast asleep again, after trying multiple times to get him up. It disrupts my sleep since I feel anxious about the dogs needing to go out, it's not okay for them to hold their bladder/bowels that long.  Any advice or insight?

He has to be in the right frame of mind when I want to bring up an issue, otherwise his defense mechanisms will kick into overdrive and it's not pleasant for either of us. My own ADHD (which is much milder) does not help with keeping these discussions up. We might do it for a few weeks then stop. We talk about issues and possible solutions. It feels very productive in the moment, but similarly, things may change temporarily then just revert.  I read a lot of advice that suggests to have these scheduled meetings, it just hasn't seemed to be very effective for us. Obviously we would first of all actually continue to have the meetings for them to work, but does anyone have any other tips on how we may approach it differently? I'd like to hear about other couples' experience with scheduled meetings, positive or negative!
