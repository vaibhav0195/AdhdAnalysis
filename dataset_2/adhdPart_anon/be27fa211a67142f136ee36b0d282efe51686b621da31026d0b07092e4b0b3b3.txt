My life is much like what I’ve been reading here- we have two kids, a mortgage, I carry the entire mental load for our life. My husband cannot be relied on and I’m exhausted by feeling like the only adult.  Finding this forum and reading all the posts has helped me feel less alone.   He’s lost four jobs. The job he has now has reduced his salary for the third time because he just isn’t doing the work. He’s the primary breadwinner.  He needs to find a therapist and has agreed to go to counseling. I assume he needs to find a Cognitive Behavioral Therapist. Other than that, is there anything specific he be looking for?   Thank you.
