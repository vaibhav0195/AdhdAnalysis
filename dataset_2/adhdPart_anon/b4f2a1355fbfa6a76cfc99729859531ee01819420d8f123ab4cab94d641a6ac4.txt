Eventually I have a sit down conversation where I explain the toll it’s taking. Ask him to make a schedule. He feels bad and helps out more, acting as if he’s always been this way and being hyper focused on cleanliness. Within a week or so, he will be back to only helping if I’m already in the middle cleaning something, which I hate because it gives the illusion of help without actually being helpful. A week after that I swear he stays in the bedroom until I’m done cleaning  My own behaviour is predictable too. I feel frustrated and resentful. Going through phases of polite reminders, to nagging, to just doing it myself. Thinking “I can’t do this forever”.  After talking and seeing improvements I think “oh, maybe I can, maybe I can have a happy relationship with this man. Maybe my sex drive will come back” to once again being disappointed.   Does anyone else have a similar cycle?  By the way, undiagnosed partner, I have asked him to get diagnosed and in therapy. Nothing so far and not sure how much longer I can handle the lack of initiative.
