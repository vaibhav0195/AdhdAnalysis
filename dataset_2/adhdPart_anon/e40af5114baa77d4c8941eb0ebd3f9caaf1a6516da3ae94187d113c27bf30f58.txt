It was a little intense during the day, I'm not sure if that will calm down with time, but he couldn't sleep. And sleep has been an ongoing issue as well.   He already had melatonin on hand, but that didn't really seem to help. He couldn't fall asleep till around 4 am. He didn't feel wired, just couldn't settle down to sleep.   We will also be discussing with his physican of course, but I just was curious if this was a common side effect that we could expect to go away or calm down over time? Not looking for medical advice, just experiences! Or if they was anything OTC that helped?
