His doctor recommended Vyvanse over a year ago and we seem to remember him trying it once but not sticking with it for some reason, then moving to Adderall. Now that his doctor has his needs better dialed in, he has him trying Vyvanse again. We're hearing it could take a month for it to be fully effective, though my partner has read of people realizing a change very quickly too.  What was your experience with Vyvanse? It comes highly recommended and positive but I'd love to hear more personal takes on it.

What did it take to get them back on the horse?  He doesn't really have a career path and thinks unless he LOVES work, it's not worth doing (or isn't interested in doing it). I have a job I like but we need two incomes, and I know eventually I'm going to get resentful of being the only one working (and running the house).   I have no idea how to motivate or encourage him to look at anything and take whatever comes his way, and that not everyone feels their jobs are their great loves in life. Any advice is welcome.

He's medicated, but I think he's overmedicated. He's barely sleeping, and his focus is still very scattered and all over the place. Right now he's on a new hobby and he's thrown himself in, as they do. He's not great at making new friends but he found a hobby group about an hour away so he went down to hang out with them all day today. That's a big step for him, he has a really hard time sustaining friendships, and this won't be any different because eventually this hobby will also stop being interesting in a couple of months.  He works at home so he barely leaves the house and sometimes I feel kind of stifled but I'm using this time to get caught up on Hobbies of my own. We have a long road ahead of us once the healing actually begins, and if I'm honest for not in a great place but we haven't talked about it lately because of how sensitive he is. Hyper emotion is a very frustrating aspect of ADHD because it feels like I can never really tell him how I'm feeling without hurting his feelings. While things haven't been great for a while, I'm glad that he is stepping outside of his comfort zone to meet up with this group today.  One of the more hurtful parts of this is that I think about him all the time and how this affects him and us but I don't think he thinks of me as often or in the same way. I'm hoping we can turn a corner soon.

At first it seemed like a clear change, he was energetic and his work snapped into focus\*, he cleaned the kitchen and got a lot of stuff done. He said he felt (and seemed very) wired and over-medicated. He couldn't sit still and was very antsy to keep moving and doing. Until....7:30 pm when he'd crash and space out, then couldn't fall asleep at night. We couldn't enjoy evenings out because he'd suddenly become so unfocused that it was distracting for us both. When it wore off, it was like the ADHD came back much worse which made conversations frustrating and not enjoyable.  That went on for about a week but by the second week through the end of the 30 days' of pills, it wore off completely. His work began to suffer again, he'd forget why he went into rooms or start tasks and not finish them. His appetite is still affected, but the drug isn't doing what they'd hoped. He became really frustrated at the slide back down.  His doctor just switched him to Strattera, a non-stimulant, to see if that might help set a baseline for what to expect. If this does not work, she'll do some testing for him and put him on Adderall or something similar. We knew there would be some trial and error, so this is that.  \*Funny (to me) effect: When we talked about how work was going for him, he said he realized suddenly that perhaps his job wasn't as demanding and taxing as he thought it was, and might actually get a little boring in parts. Once he got his tasks and systems in order, everything went much smoother and his thoughts weren't competing for space in his mind where he'd then get overwhelmed. He described his days and to me, with my "typical brain", it sounded like MY day but for him it was a total change of pace that he's still struggling to articulate and understand. It made me realize just how long he'd be living in mental chaos.

He takes it right when I leave for work in the morning, he works from home, and it wears off around 7 or 8 at night. He's discovering that it's making him more organized and he has clear thoughts now so he's able to get through his work in a much better way. That's great because that's what the medication is for, but when it wears off at night he hits the wall.   Friday night we went out for a nice dinner and evening out but halfway through dinner, he said he could feel the medication wearing off and suddenly he got very distracted and felt like he was crashing. We finished our food and just went home, which was disappointing. He said he's felt like this every night that he's taken the drugs, when they wear off it sets him back a few paces.   I'm hoping this is an adjustment time and it won't be like this forever, but between him being a little speedy and kind of annoying if I'm honest, and being successful with his job, I feel like I should probably just shut up and let it all play out.  How did it go for you when your spouse started on meds?

Apparently it's a law in our state that they rule out depression and anxiety before giving medication for ADHD due to the potential for ADHD med abuse.   Has anyone else experienced this or have any insight? I don't know anything about that drug.

But have you ever seen your ADHD spouse do something you know they've done at a job and probably resulted in discipline or firing? I just did the other day and I feel like I got a window into what happens.  I asked my spouse to run some errands for me since he's not working and I'm working at home full time. I gave him a pile of returns, things some to the post office, and some to a store. When I went into the living room after working all day, I found two of the return items still sitting there even though I knew he'd come back. I asked him why those were still there. It turns out that he packed the completely wrong things and mixed up the returns.  He sort of froze instead of answering me, then hopped on his phone to retrace his steps and (I think) re-read my text to him with instructions. I heard him try to call the post office to see if the package could be stopped (no), and I got hold of the warehouse that would receive the wrong package as well as the intended recipient to tell them there had been a mistake. I had never seen him make such a huge, easily avoided mistake before that touched so many other areas and people. He was laid off months ago after making, he said, some stupid mistakes. I think this is probably what it was. Just not paying attention at all, not double checking instructions, and messing up royal.   He's made similar mistakes that were easily fixed (by me), wrote his birthday instead of today's date on documents that I caught and changed without telling him, things like that. And now I have a whole other level of anxiety when it's time for him to go back to work...

Husband found a doctor's office, paid through the nose in a shady way, is seeing them for the last time tomorrow morning, and moved himself over to a doctor recommended by a friend who is on top of it!   Where we live for some reason, it's been very difficult to find doctor's offices who operate with any urgency or efficiency. The one he found that put him on the Lexapro moved his first appointment twice, then overcharged us but didn't specify the exact charges to our insurance company, and now there's confusion that we owe money we actually don't. They told him the overcharge would be applied as a credit, which could be used towards the $500 ADHD testing, however we're using it to pay for the final appointment tomorrow so he can re-up the Lexapro and take our business elsewhere.  After he hung up with his new doctor, he came to tell me how effortless making the appointment was and how she wouldn't charge for testing nor need all the testing materials we'd rushed to prepare, he had tears in his eyes. It felt like such a huge relief to find a doctor who is clearly willing to work with us beyond our wallets, and who seems to really want to help. His first appointment isn't until the end of this month because she's busy, but we're both excited and feeling so much better about heading into this process.  Hang in there, fellow sufferers. I have to believe help is out there!
