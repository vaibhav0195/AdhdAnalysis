My question is to parents of children with ADHD. What were the first signs and symptoms you observed in your child? I ask because I'm pretty sure my husband (38m) has it, and we just became first time parents during the pandemic. I know, great time for the added stress of transitioning into parenthood... I just want to be prepared to fully support my child as he grows up and if he has inherited adhd I want to be able to get him dx and get him all the help and support that my husband never got.
