34453c5841337ef7a041ac86d6a50bee0449fc5fbd07f626d07c94296ef8c357;;;I’m lost and tired with my partner;;;My partner (M18) DX , and I (F17) NDX have been dating for 10 months now, I feel utterly and completely lost on what to do, we struggle with communication, we’ve had this struggle in the beginning and he initiated a break that lasted a week and he asked me out- from then it’s been 10 months and as much as we’ve improved I feel like him personally has improved but then has stagnated and has stopped concentrating on the issue which in turn has made more arguments arise , he always says that I bitch about the little things that I say- for instance I will be saying “I feel like you’ve been really cold with me today and I want to know if I’ve done something or if there’s a issue” and he would just get annoyed that I blamed myself for his problem and it’ll turn into me apologising and somehow admitting it’s my fault for his issue.  I will admit, I ain’t perfect, and I make mistakes, but I try my hardest to understand and communicate any issues we might have or anything that might be up with me, I’m honest and blunt with things because I have learned sugarcoating stuff will not resolve anything between us.  Just today, he’s been sweet with me for the next few hours then cold and grumpy with me, and I made a stupid joke on my Snapchat about if my partner cheated I would burn their car- and he replied to that with “I will petrolbomb your house and family if you touched my property” , I feel that was uncalled for and utterly wrong, and I voiced that, I have made it clear to him it was not aimed at him and that in fact it was a joke as it had a meme attached to it from another person and I just added to it without thinking.   He’s behaviour towards the meme about cheating made me feel like he was acting suspicious- and I made that clear to him, “I understand you misunderstood the meme but your reaction is starting to look suspicious”  And to that he responded to- “ wow are you being serious! Do you really think I would cheat on you”   And it was a on and off argument about this- but enough of that- we ended the conversation with me saying that “I feel replaced with the way you have acted the past months and with how things are going, I am not saying I want to break up in no way shape or form , but what I am saying is you need to work on your communication because I feel like this relationship has become one sided”  And his response was “Wow you really think I’m that sad to replace you? I’m not changing for anyone , if you don’t like it you know where the block button is and how to break up with me”  This was all on text btw- after a while he called and apologised, I’ve accepted it because I’m tired of crying and feeling so hurt.  His rude behaviour has been continuous , every odd week he would get extremely rude, and I can’t say I’m perfect I add fuel to his fire and I can’t excuse my behaviour but I do own up to it and apologise.  He takes his meds off and on, and he’s on the highest dosage of adhd medication.  I don’t know how anyone could help me with this- but any info or advice will be greatly appreciated, I think I might of rambled but I’m at my wits end.
