My (33F) partner (25NB) is diagnosed adhd (unmedicated, but trying some treatments) and we have an okay relationship overall (5 years and counting). We do have a prickly issue whenever don't feel like having sex and they do, which goes in either two roots: either they cry/ have an emotional moment and have their mood down or they say nothing, go sleep on the guest room and act cold for a week or so.  We keep trying to manage, but it is hard because they can pin point how they feel only that there is extreme pain (which is why i associate it to the rsd) and when i try to engage with them the next day (when i have more energy) they tend to be too hurt to be in the mood.  Anyway, wanted to know if this was a re occuring problem for anyone and if yes, any solutions/advice? While i want to say yes most times there is just those times that i don't want to and its hard not to take it personally.

My partner has add and high functioning depression. We are in the process of getting help for both but it will take a few months. My partner recently graduated but with covid 19 has been unable to get a job and therefore lost a big part of their structure. This has ended up with them getting pretty shifted in sleep schedule, they go to bed between 3 and 5 am, and in both cases they tend to stay awake and get quite anxious, this makes them either wake me up by hugging me, get angry at anything doing noise and wake me or fight the sheets and wake me. This has gotten worst this week, has i am yet to sleep more than 3 hours in a row. I also am the only bread winner and have a 9 to 5 job,  and feel like a zombie today. I don't want to sleep separately, but starting to feel like I will have to (but prefer not) I have been trying to convince them to go to bed early but always end up getting an very irritated reply. The waking up i have been trying to make them a delicious breakfast everytime, but they always coma sleep halfway when i am at work. So yeah, any routine advice that could make this a bit better?
