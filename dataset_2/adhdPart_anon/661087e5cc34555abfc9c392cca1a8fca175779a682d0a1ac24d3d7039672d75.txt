I don't know how concerned I should really be.  Context: She isn't getting drunk every day, but it is beyond the "have a drink or two with dinner to unwind" kind if drink. She also is not a pot head. I'm pretty sure she smokes every night, but as far as I know she doesn't drink or smoke during the day.  Her first drink is around dinner and she won't smoke until after our kids go to bed. It's still EVERY night though. Am I being too uptight and judgemental for having a problem with this?  Do I need to loosen up?  The last time I tried to express my concern about smoking nightly she got super defensive and we had a HUGE argument.   Any perspective on this is helpful.  Thanks all.

It's gotten that way with parenting.  She is miserable and keeps talking about how she wants to be able to do art (btw, she's an artist).  I LOVE that she's an artist and wants to do art.  The problem is that she seems to not be able to do art unless she rents an expensive studio space, and is locked away in the solitude of her off site studio for 8-10 hours a day.  If she can't give her hyper focus for extended time and uninterrupted, then she just can't do it.   If she can't be creative, then she HATES her life and becomes resentful towards me and the kids as we are the reason she can't be the person she wants to be.     But she's a stay at home mom of two small children and I am the only income provider of the house.  I work from home right now, but I have to work, not do child care to afford her the time away from home to do it.  In too if that, the times in the past that she has been able to work on art, she can't do anything because she becomes paralyzed with a host of other mental and emotional blocks.  I keep asking her to help find a middle ground, but she either can't or won't.  She just stays stuck in this mental loop of everything and everyone else in her life telling her she can't.  She is constantly miserable, dealing with extreme anxiety, and on the verge of panic attacks at all time.  The fact we are living in a pandemic makes all if this q million times worse.  I'm not sure if I'm asking advice, or just getting this off my chest....  I don't know how our marriage survives this.

We have 2 children ages 4 and 7. In the last year my wife has been diagnosed with both OCD and ADHD. Learning about her diagnosis and finding groups like this have really validated the frustration and loneliness I have dealt with for the last decade of my life. I have put up so many defense mechanisms and built my entire life around not upsetting the delicate balance of my wife's mood. It has exhausted me to a level I couldn't fathom. She is on meds now which kind of help, but the two diagnosis are so intertwined it's hard to tell how much. She has also been working with her therapist to go through exposure therapy for her OCD, which is its own challenge to say the least.   Is there anyone that has been through something like this?  I'm so tired. How did you make it to the other side?  How can I build new ways of communicating with her?  We are going to be doing marital therapy, but haven't started yet. Any help, advice, or solace would go a long way.

My ADHD wife, still working on finding the right medication, and I have started couples therapy. We each see our individual counselors, but we realized we needed relationship help bad. This week was our second session. I have been feeling so alone and taken for granted, but somehow by the end of the session I was painted to be the reason for the problems we are having. Somehow she hijacked the conversation and turned into an hour long ranting session about how I am not open enough with my feelings and judge her too much for being over emotional. By the end of it, I felt like the bad guy. What the actual fuck happened?  How did she jiu jitsu that conversation back into me like that?  I was stunned and infuriated.   I realized, though, that's how most of our "serious" talks go.  I trigger her defenses and she flips everything back on me. The problem is that she doesn't do it in an obvious confrontational fashion. Instead, she deftly shifts the conversation, then makes it about something completely different. While I'm still trying to figure out what the hell happened she turns it on me and turns me into the villain. And she's been doing this for the last decade. I hate it.   I hate talking to my wife.  I realize it's only session 2. I realize she is less than a year into being aware of her diagnosis. I realize that she hasn't found the right medication yet.   But I hate talking to my wife.  I probably should have out this into the weekly rant section. Thanks for wasting a few minutes of your day reading this. I'm open to advice and certainly to any words of encouragement.  I'm devastated.  I hate talking to my wife...and I hate myself for saying it.

She keeps telling me that she wants me to tell her about my feelings. Then I try to tell her about my pain, and about the damage her constant emotional swings and intense outbursts do.  I tell her about how hurt, and ignored I've felt for 14 years now. I try to tell her that just because I'm NT, it doesn't mean I've got it all figured out, and I'm processing through what her diagnosis means at the same time she is, just in a different way.  I tell her about the types of hurtfully things she says, and then be tell her how she could say them differently to get her point across without being hurtful. I tell her I'm just looking for her to acknowledge how I feel without trying to explain it away or invalidate it.  EVERY TIME I have tried explaining my feelings she gets defensive, tries to explain why what I feel isn't accurate because she wasn't trying to hurt me, and then tells me she's confused, because what I say doesn't make sense.    I'm a teacher and a communicator for a living. Why is it that my spouse is the one person who can't ever understand what I'm saying?  Am I not as good at communicating as I thought?  Is she incapable of actually understanding my view point?  Is this a lost cause?  It sure feels like it.

ADHD has presented HUGE struggles for us to work on. Then came a lockdown and a pandemic that seems to never end.  This year has amplified our struggles and almost broke both of us more than once.  We are struggling as individuals and as a couple.  What is your experience?  How has this year effected your already challenging relationships?  Have you found helpful things to do or try during this period that has been helpful?  Please share your story.

Now she's diagnosed with ADHD as well as OCD, she is in therapy, and medicated. I see a counselor myself as well.  We are trying to work through Melissa Orlov's book together.  It seems like every time we take a step forward, we also take a step back.  I know there's no magical fix out there, but it's hard to see progress.  It seems like it's harder now than it may have ever been.  Did it get harder for you before it got better?  Is this normal?
