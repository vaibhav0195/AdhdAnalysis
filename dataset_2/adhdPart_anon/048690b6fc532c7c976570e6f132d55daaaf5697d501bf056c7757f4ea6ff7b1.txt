My wife of 20 years has ADHD and, I suspect, rejection dysphoria (DX - diagnosed six months ago and medicated). We have three children. I suspect one has ADHD too.   I love her and she has some amazing qualities but I’m broken by our marriage. I desperately want her to get better but we’ve been in couples’ counselling for three years, she’s had individual ADHD counselling for 12 weeks, and I feel like we’re just not getting better enough.   I want to say again that there’s so much to love about her before I say the rest. She doesn’t listen, she lies, she forgets things, she rages sometimes, hates me, is sarcastic with me, interrupts me constantly, ignores me, makes awful comments in front of people and sometimes just gleefully (metaphorically) tears me apart.   She desperately want to improve but just can’t seem to sustain anything for more than three days.   The only time she seems interested in my is when our relationship is in trouble. She’ll do just enough to calm things down then lose focus and forget to bother any more.   She desperately wants to be loved and to feel safe. I want her to have those things but, after her last 36-hour-long meltdown a few weeks ago, I look at my life and wonder why I’m here in this relationship.   She’s not my child but I often feel like that’s our dynamic. Just recently I’m looking at it all again and wondering why on earth I’m staying.   I feel broken by 20 years of undiagnosed ADHD but more broken by the hope I had when she was diagnosed followed by a creeping realisation that this remains very unpredictable and very hard.   I love her. I want to give her a loving and safe home. But I’m so exhausted and broken by her.  I don’t know what to do.   Thank you for reading this.
