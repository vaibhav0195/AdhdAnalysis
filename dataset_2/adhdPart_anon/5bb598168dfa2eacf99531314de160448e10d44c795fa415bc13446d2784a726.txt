I was recently diagnosed with adhd and have started treatment and I want very much to improve my behaviour, medication has helped alot and I have seen an ADHD coach to help me with reading social cues, staying focused at university, organisation and improving my maturity. Its so hard though because every conversation I have with my girlfriend at the moment is about something I did in the past that was immature, impulsive or I procrastinated on something. I just dont know which way to turn or what to do.
