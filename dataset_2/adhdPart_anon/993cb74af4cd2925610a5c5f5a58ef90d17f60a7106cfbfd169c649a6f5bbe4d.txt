993cb74af4cd2925610a5c5f5a58ef90d17f60a7106cfbfd169c649a6f5bbe4d;;;Losing sleep over frustrations;;;My (31f) dx husband (31m) has consistently fallen through on promises. We've been married for 4 years and living together for almost 5. When we moved in together he brought a lot of boxes full of stuff he hasn't touched in years and promised he would go through them and get rid of them. Well 5 years later they are still taking over our only spare bedroom (2 bed apartment). Plus we had to get a storage unit for spillover because he buys things we have no space for.    On top of that he mostly hasn't been working since moving in together. He worked part time for a year but quit to go back to school which he ended up quitting as well. For the past 1.5 years he's neither been in school or working. Plus he hasn't gone through all his stuff to make room for our spare room to be functional (you know, like maybe as a home office during this pandemic). He refuses to let me help - it turns into an explosive fight if I even suggest it. He hired a professional organizer per my suggestion but only had them come once and then gave up.    I'm at my wit's end. I'm just so frustrated that I lose sleep over it. He's on medication but I see no difference from when he's on it vs off but he refuses to ask his psychiatrist for a change in dosage or drugs because he says he feels a difference.    Any other help or suggestions I offer are met with defensiveness and often name-calling. I just don't know what to do anymore because I don't see this ever changing. I'm tired of being the sole income earner and also having no say in how to organize my home.
