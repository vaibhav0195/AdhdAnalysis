Then today I came to this subreddit and started reading and I’m thinking some of these issues sound very common.   She ends up on her phone A LOT. I don’t feel like we are able to have deeply connected conversations because she seems to get distracted by either her phone or other thoughts. At dinner she will sometimes enter her calories before eating or use her phone during dinner instead of enjoying the time together. Sometimes even mid conversation I’ll keep talking and ask a question and she’s off somewhere else half listening like I could almost just walk out of the room unnoticed.  After sex she doesn’t seem to want to be intimate/cuddle and prefers getting on her phone. She has some pretty serious memory issues for things,conversations or events. However is great remembering where we parked or how to get back from a hike. She is not a homebody for sure. She gets real agitated some times if we aren’t active enough. She says she needs to travel because that’s her true love, but I also wonder if it could be related.   I’m not necessarily asking to confirm a diagnosis I’m just wondering if some of these things sound familiar and it is something that I need to dive deeper into with her. We do love each other and she says she wants to Marry me and have a family together, but sometimes I feel so insignificant it makes it tough to want to take the next step.  Thank you!
