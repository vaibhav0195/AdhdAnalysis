I knew he had adhd pretty early on and knew he would be a little bit different to deal with. And thats okay, I love him and I want to adapt to him so we can work together.  One thing I didnt expect to be so hard is sex. But with adhd its hard for him to be able to pay attention to me and whats going on around him, and body issues do not help on his side. I've tried so much. I dont know what to do next. I don't know how to keep his attention or if it wanders, I don't know how to get him back.  We only see each other for short periods of time because of distance so it always feels like a race to get it while we can.  It's really hard because I wanted to develop a really good sex life and it just feels hard and complicated and I don't know where to start or what else I can do to help.  Will delete soon because I dont want this post found.
