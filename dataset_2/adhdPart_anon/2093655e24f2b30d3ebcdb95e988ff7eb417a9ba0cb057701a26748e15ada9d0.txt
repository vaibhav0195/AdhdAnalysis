2093655e24f2b30d3ebcdb95e988ff7eb417a9ba0cb057701a26748e15ada9d0;;;How can i end my relationship?;;;We have been together for 4 years now, Im 23 and she's 25 (dx). She is the first oficial relationship i have ever had because i had never let myself get too close to people because of my own mental illness (a dissociative and trauma dissorder), so i have never had any experience at ending relationships but this one just feels like a chore for both of us, i need support she cant give me and i dont know how im failing her but im sure she is not satisfied with me.  I love her and she loves me, intenselly, but our comunication is crap and any effort i do to talk to her is ignored, and i dont want/need her to be there or aviable 24/7 but when i text her  saying that im having allucinations or that someone is stalking me i just need some basic support not just "oh wow" she makes me feel like no one would ever care about my problems.  If we moved together she would see how fucked up i am and her adhd would make everything worse, this thing is not going to work, it just stopped working since i graduated university and then the quarentine and now we just send each other messajes like once every couple of days, i could reach out more and try to talk to her more but i dont trust her.  I know she wont even make an effort to contact me if i just dissapear but i dont want to just dissapear to end the relationship, i need closure but i dont know how to end everything without hurting her feeling and making her just blame herself for everything that went wrong
