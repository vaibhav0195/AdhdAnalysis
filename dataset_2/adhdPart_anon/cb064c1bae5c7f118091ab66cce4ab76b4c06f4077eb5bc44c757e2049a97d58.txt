cb064c1bae5c7f118091ab66cce4ab76b4c06f4077eb5bc44c757e2049a97d58;;;Suggestions always wrong...;;;Hello,   My boyfriend is undiagnosed starting to get the ball rolling now. But he has been seen a psychologist.   He made a plan with the psych last Thursday, which didnâ€™t work. And now each plan he has made since then he hasnâ€™t done.   I tried suggesting making a new plan, with a new time, but that gets shut down. I suggest just sitting with me at the table with his laptop while Iâ€™m doing my assignment to try and get him to do his, tried to make him feel productive (walked dog &amp; showered) still nope.   Every single thing I do or suggest he just shuts down. Doesnâ€™t even try. I know he isnâ€™t lazy, and now that we are considering ADHD (been together 6 years like this) I get that his brain works differently. But I just have zero clue what to do.  He keeps failing uni subjects coz he doesnâ€™t complete assignments, then feels shit for failing. Iâ€™m just at a loss...   Please help ðŸ˜“
