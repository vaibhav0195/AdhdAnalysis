What lately is happening, and with lately i mean past year or two.   My hope is that some here might have advice for me.  What happens is this.  Things go well. He respects that i need now and then breathing room and he barely complaints. Then it starts with constantly asking confirmation if everything is fine. I try to console him all is fine. Also when he panicks i try and calm him with logic. That works untill, and i do not know what the trigger is, he starts to be mean. Acts impulsive, and is all over the place with his emotions.  For example. We have a young child together and also a puppy. He says he is tired and complaints about the dog after every walk. I tell him, shall i walk the dog? Then it is a big no and he can handle it.. okey. I sport twice a week. On social media he posts a cute pic of him and child, how happy he is and grateful. I come home and all is bad and stressed and panick ensues. I am not longer gone then 2 hours.  And then it is waiting for something happening like throwing something hard towards the puppy. Next day i want to talk to him about it and he acts if he is the victim and he doea what hebdoes to help me.... i just don't know how to get out of this downward spiral. It is sucking me empty of energy.
