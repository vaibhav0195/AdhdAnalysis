Just last night we talked openly in a non judgemental way, and I told him I just don't know/ when/ why certain things stick and become a habit and others don't. He mentioned that he's been working on the oven " turn off habit" by visualizing himself turning it off, over and over, and that helped him remember to do it this week. If this is how new habits can be formed, I think this is extremely important! I share with you in case it helps your ADHD partner.
