Is this ADHD related?;;;Hi all, I feel kinda bad posting this, like I'm going behind my partner's back for advice, but I need to know if this is something common, something we can work through, something I should be worried about, etc? (Also sorry if this isn't ADHD related enough, my partner follows r/relationship_advice)  Recently, over the past 3 months overall, and the past 2-3 more frequently, my partner has been saying I should leave them. They cite all of their chronic health issues, their struggles with getting an ADHD diagnosis, general relationship issues, almost anything they can make an argument for, to say that I'm too good for them. My response is always the same (that I love them, their issues are no more than small hiccups, and that I would want someone else because I fucking don't) but after I respond it seems to make them just more upset or sad and usually ends with awkward silence or tears.   They insist they still love me and don't want me to leave, but they seem very intent to push me away? Is this a common ADHD thing that ties into the emotional instability? Have any of you encountered this or overcome this with your ADHD partner? Is this a sign of something else that I'm missing? Thank you for any advice.
