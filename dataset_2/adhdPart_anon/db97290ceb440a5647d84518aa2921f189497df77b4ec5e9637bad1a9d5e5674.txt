I'm getting to the point where I'm starting to resent my husband. He was diagnosed almost a year ago and medicated for the last seven months and while it's been mostly successful, there are still times when I feel like I'm running the entire show. As much as I want him to take on household tasks on his own, I know that he won't unless I ask him to do them or do them with him. It's exhausting and it's starting to build resentment.  The bigger problem as I see it, is that he thinks of his ADHD personally. Like if something is bothering me that is directly linked to the ADHD, he think it's HIM not the condition, so he gets offended and hurt, and then we don't really get anywhere. I've tried to explain to him that I don't see his ADHD has something he does intentionally or makes worse so I can't be made at him, I'm mad at it. But he sees it like a personal failing and source of poor self esteem. This leaves us at a stalemate where he feels shitty and I feel angry. I need help here and I think he does too, but he doesn't realize it yet. I've had creeping thoughts lately of wondering if I want to live the rest of my life like this and I dread that thinking. I love my husband, I don't want us to split up, but I feel so out of my depth with it that I don't know where to turn.  My new job's insurance kicks in this week and I'm going to ask him if he'll consider seeing his therapist more often, and see if we can find a therapist for us both. I already have one of my own but this feels more important.

I love him, he's great like, 90% of the time about most things, but when he gets on a tear about a project or topic, it's relentless. He thanks me for listening to him go on and he knows most of the stuff he's into doesn't really grab me, but we don't have a lot of friends and he doesn't have anyone else to indulge him. Sometimes when he starts on a topic or project, he'll start talking about it to me and won't stop for many, many minutes in a row. I want to be supportive and loving to him but as soon as I see him start gathering materials for another adventure, part of me just dreads it because I know it will be all I will hear about for the next several weeks.  Meanwhile, the dishes sit undone in the sink and the lawn needs to be mowed, but he's completely focused on his project and I have to fight being the nag that pulls him away from it to tend to the house. It can be really, really exhausting.
