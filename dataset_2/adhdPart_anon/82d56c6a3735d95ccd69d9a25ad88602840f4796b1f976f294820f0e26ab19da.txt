82d56c6a3735d95ccd69d9a25ad88602840f4796b1f976f294820f0e26ab19da;;;Doctor vent;;;I'm sure you all know that it isn't so easy to get ADHD medication and there are a lot of hoops everyone has to jump through in order to get them.  My husband was diagnosed ADHD maybe 8-10 years ago. Doc has him on methylphenidate. He has to get a Prior Authorization release every year for our insurance company. Doc forgot the first couple years but seems to be ahead of it now.  My husband was on my health insurance until recently. Same insurance company, he just has a different policy now. When I let our pharmacist know, he said right away, "He'd better call the doctor and let him know so they can get his Prior Auth done." which I relayed to my husband.  Husband calls clinic and is reassured that this doesn't need to be done since there is already scripts in place and it is the same insurance company. This was a month ago.  I am sure everyone can see where this is going now. He DID need a new Prior Auth, clinic just put it in and now it is stuck being processed by the insurance company. Hubby is out of meds. Clinic worker just called and was very patronizing saying that they couldn't do anything about it and it was up to the insurance company now. Like he hadn't called a MONTH PRIOR! UGHHHH
