0fdb2df547bf6d066d376ec3bdb127dd803998f9d5c4e250c1d69e56100595dc;;;Im losing my mind. I love my adhd-partner so much, and I cannot make it work;;;I dont know what to do anymore. He is trying sometimes, to be present with me, ask me how my day was, remember to reach out first. And I really appreciate it when it happens. But it comes and goes like tide waves.   I get upset when he pulls away and because of is RSD, he thinks the whole world is coming to an end. He keeps saying that he cant do anything right. Which is not true. I cant talk to him about the issue because we never get to talk about it, because he shuts off or gets angry and discards me for days.   I get upset when he forgets me, and it really breaks my heart. My love language is being present, and he thinks Im a nag for it. Im so upset by being told Im a nag, Im hysterical, Im bitchy. Im tired of being a job he needs to check off his list. I think somebody else would appreciate that I want to be close to them. With him he tells me Im crazy for it.   &amp;#x200B;  He says he will never change. I told him he cant always just run away, and he said yes he can, and then he hung up on me again. He has already grown so much when we have been together. He got into therapy and adhd treatment. He started to open up and became aware of how he lies about everything. But I dont know if he is faking it, because once in awhile this other person comes out, and he reminds me of my father who was a narcissist abuser.   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;
