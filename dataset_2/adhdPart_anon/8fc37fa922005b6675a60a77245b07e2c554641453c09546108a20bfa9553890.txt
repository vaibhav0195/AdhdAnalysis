I knew he was ADHD since day we met so I tried to understand his condition more, so I have always treated him with proper amount of attention, understanding, and I tried to please him. His low self esteem some nights broke my heart but I understand that he has ways of seeing the world and himself.  Monday I find out gender and will tell him the news that he will have a son or daughter. In past month he revealed to me he was married with a 7 mo old. He regrets ever meeting me due to me not aborting 2 months ago. His reaction to pregnancy was particularly horrific in that he accused me of lying, called me insane, naive, and without reason.   Before this i knew him as smart, charming, well spoken/read, and a man who complimented me a lot in the year we slept together. Am genuinely scared to contect him but for sake of baby I will. As much as his reaction to me is hurtful and I want to hurt him back with insults and accusations, I have managed to be respectful of fact that he has adhd and may suffer greatly if I show anger or try to return insults. What is best way to reveal news that to him, he says...will ruin his life. This will have to come out eventually as court ordered paternity test will happen in June for formal paternity for childsupport, which I am trying to avoid by getting a higher paying job.
