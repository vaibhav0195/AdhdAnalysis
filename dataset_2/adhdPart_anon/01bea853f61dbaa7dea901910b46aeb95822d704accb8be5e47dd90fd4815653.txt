01bea853f61dbaa7dea901910b46aeb95822d704accb8be5e47dd90fd4815653;;;(NDX) Ironic happenings and advice to help push partner towards help?;;;If this isn’t kosher let me know- I’ll remove the post ASAP  My wife has undiagnosed (in adulthood but IEP and therapy as a child) ADHD. The only thing she’s ever focused on for any period of time is her work/career. Everything else is forgotten.  She has lost her debit card (and, subsequently, mine that she had to borrow while her replacement was enroute) over five times in five years. Once it was because she was fiddling with it in a drive-thru and it went down into the door via the window.   She never remembers appointments (hers, mine, or our kids), performances for the kids, etc.  She’s never seen a gynecologist (she’s almost 30). She hasn’t seen a regular primary care doctor in over ten years.   Her New Years Resolution this year was to find a physician and get help. It’s August. Nope, didn’t happen.  Anyway- long story to the ironic part. I bought her a small, pocket-sized day planner so she could write whatever she needed to remember down. Dates, notes, whatever. I made sure it fit into her work pants.  You guys.  She washed it inside the work pants. The irony that she forgot to check her pockets (AGAIN) and destroyed the single thing that was support help her....   I’m burnt out, y’all.  She doesn’t deny she has a problem and needs help. In fact, she regularly apologizes for her actions. She knows I’m burnt out. She seems timid about the idea of medication (although I believe she needs it) but is okay with OT.  I don’t want to be her parent and find her doc, make her appointments and make her go. I have three young children already- I should t have to, right?  What are some things your partners have responded well to- in terms of finding help?
