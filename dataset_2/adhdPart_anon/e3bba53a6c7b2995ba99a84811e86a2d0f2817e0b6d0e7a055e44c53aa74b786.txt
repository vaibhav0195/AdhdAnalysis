My (25f) husband (DX, 28m) has struggled with holding jobs down long-term for most of his adult life. He ended up getting a masters in the field he wants to work in, which was an amazing achievement. He’s not accessing any form of treatment right now due to long waiting lists for adult ADHD services.   He graduated a year ago now and has since defaulted back to working in the same poorly paid jobs that he’s always hated. It’s making him so unhappy and it breaks my heart. Working a job you hate is horrible for anyone, let alone someone with ADHD.   He’s been applying for a few jobs here and there  with varying success, but I know he needs to really focus on some good quality applications to get to where he wants to be. He just seems unable to focus his attention on that, and will instead spend evenings reading around his field and coming up with crazy schemes to make money/save time and never seems to follow anything through, including actual projects related to his field.   How can I support him to take a more focused approach to his job hunt? I’m finding myself getting frustrated and being hard on him which I feel so guilty for. It’s burning a hole in our relationship. Sadly we don’t have enough money for him to give up work to focus on applications.     TL;DR - DX partner needs support with focusing on job search, don’t know how to support him as I’m getting frustrated. Can anyone relate/suggest strategies?
