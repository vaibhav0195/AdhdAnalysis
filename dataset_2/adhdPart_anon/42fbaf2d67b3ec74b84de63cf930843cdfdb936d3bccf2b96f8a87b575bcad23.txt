He is using his meds, but they seem to be doing nothing during this time, and his main symptom is that he has completely disassociated from me. I have to talk to him up to 10 times before he will hear me, he is hyperfocusing on his phone, and we haven’t had a meaningful conversation in about three weeks.  I love him deeply, but this is taking a toll on me. I miss him and don’t know where he is in there. Does anyone have any suggestions for what we can do for him and what I can do to keep myself sane in this difficult time?
