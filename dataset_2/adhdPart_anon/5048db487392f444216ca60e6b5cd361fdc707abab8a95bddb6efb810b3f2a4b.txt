5048db487392f444216ca60e6b5cd361fdc707abab8a95bddb6efb810b3f2a4b;;;Medication regulation and adjustments;;;Does anyone else experience that medication only works for a few years before needing to be re-evaluated? I feel like I am going crazy. We’ve had a solid and relatively easy few years, but I swear, when we hit three year mark since his last med adjustment  things start slowly falling apart and getting him to realize it’s no longer effective feels impossible. I am banging my head against the wall trying to get him to realize he’s majorly regressing because he is still able to hold it all together at work and feels like I am nagging him when I bring it up.  I am not by any stretch of the imagination nagging, but if I say nothing,  he won’t initiate on his own and if I bring it up more than once every few weeks as a reminder he feels attacked.  I’m tired of waiting for him to prioritize this. I even went so far as to pull a list of providers near work that take our insurance well over 6 months ago. He called one place and was told they are not taking adult patients at the moment and has done nothing with the remaining 6 on the list.
