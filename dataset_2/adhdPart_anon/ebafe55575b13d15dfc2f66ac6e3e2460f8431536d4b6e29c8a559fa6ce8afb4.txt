I read in both this sub and the sub narcissisticabuse, and many symptoms are the same (but the response in this sub is alot more forgiving).  I rubs me the wrong way, because my partner uses his adhd diagnosis to continue behaviour that is abusive. Many of the posts I read in this sub, sounds abusive too - but people (generally women) are accepting thats just how it is. I dont get it.
