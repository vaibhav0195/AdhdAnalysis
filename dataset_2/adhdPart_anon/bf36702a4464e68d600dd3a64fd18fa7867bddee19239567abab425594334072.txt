To put it bluntly I want sex more often and she doesn't seem interested anymore. We are older in our 30s. Maybe have sex twice a month. Thats OK but I'd like it maybe once a week. I don't expect sex all the time. But we are supposed to be trying to have a baby. But we're not really having sex often enough. There's a few reasons I think why we're not.   She works retail and her schedule is ridiculous. Therefore she is always tired.   She doesn't take her meds everyday. When she doesn't take her meds she gets depressed and tired.  That special time of the month when neither of us want sex...  She's bored of it? We have been together awhile. My advances get rejected way more often now. And it just sucks.   I'm trying to workout and look better. I take care of basically everything responsible. The cooking, cleaning, house/yard work. I pay all our bills and take care of our animals too.   When we are together we spend a little time talking but mostly just watch TV and go to bed.   I'm not really sure what I can do. I don't want to talk with her about it because I feel like it'll put pressure on her to have sex when she doesn't really want to.   So I'm wondering how to get her attention back. What do I have to do? I hint at it a lot, I try to make time for it, and then just end up getting rejected. Its exhausting. I feel like her parent sometimes and I'm sure thats a turn off. Any ideas?
