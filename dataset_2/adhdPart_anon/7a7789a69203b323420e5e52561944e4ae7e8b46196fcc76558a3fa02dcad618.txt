It's a bit expensive but you can get a ton out of it if you do the work. I might sign up for this class.
7a7789a69203b323420e5e52561944e4ae7e8b46196fcc76558a3fa02dcad618;;;Therapist recommended an enlightening book that's changing how I think about my partner's ADHD;;;[The ADHD Effect on Marriage.](https://www.amazon.com/ADHD-Effect-Marriage-Understand-Relationship/dp/1886941971) I started listening to it on my commute to and from work and find myself yelling out loud, "TOTALLY!" and nodding along. It is an eye-opening explanation of how our NT brains react and respond to the ADHD brain, and has tips and tricks to work within those headspaces.  It is written largely for the NT so I think there are better books out there that use different, maybe somewhat softer language for those with ADHD who likely already feel like they're failing their partners, spouses, themselves, etc. but for those of us who walk around wringing our hands and shaking our heads, it's good to hear that we are not alone.   I highly recommend it, I'm only a few chapters in an I can tell it will help how I deal with my ADHD spouse.

Boxes everywhere, half unpacked because of work the landlord still needs to do, and it's making me feel crazed and frustrated. Meanwhile, I'm working from home full days while my ADHD partner is currently out of work.  I asked him early on to tend to the house while I worked but so far that's been a bit of a bust. He makes some headway and then just stops, for whatever reason, and he's said a few times now that he's struggling to stay on task when he's not interested in the task. This means that he winds up focused and fixated on organizing non-common areas like his stuff in the basement or running errands we only sort of need to be ran right now. He can't find a tool he needs to put something up so rather than look diligently through every box, runs out mid-day to buy a new tool. Meanwhile, I'm trying to work but the dogs are barking like crazy and I can't focus.   I did all the things I'm supposed to do. I made a to-do list in priority order, I explained to him that while I work I need him to do x, y, and z and when I'm done working, I can help. I remind him if something he wants to do isn't a priority and to refocus energy on something else. If I sit down for even just a minute to take a mental break, he's right next to me also sitting or laying down. If I stop moving, he stops moving.   I'm so frustrated and worn out minding him while trying to work at the same time and it's exhausting me while already living in a house half moved into. I need help, I need encouragement, I need not to scream in his face.

Last night, I went to bed early so they could hang out together. This morning as Roy made us breakfast before Bob came down, Roy started to tell me what he witnessed Bob do the night before. But first, as Bob came downstairs, Roy asked Bob to hand him something from the fridge. I was on the couch watching TV and Bob grabbed the item then stood there watching the TV with the item in his hand for a long time (I didn't say anything, I just waited). Eventually, Bob says, "DUDE!" and Bob turns around to hand him the thing he fetched. They laughed.  When Bob went to the bathroom, Roy turned to me and said:  "I watched him open a beer, walk over there and set it down, then stop to watch the TV for a long while, then walk back to the fridge to grab another beer. I pointed out that he already opened one, he looked at it and laughed. Then he picked up a bag of snacks and stood there eating them at the counter, created a mess of garbage, and walked away from it without a thought. Then he said down on the couch and held the remote to change the channel, but just watched the TV for about five minutes before asking where the remote was. I pointed to it and he laughed again... is that what it's like?"  I just walked over to Roy, hugged him, and welcomed him to my world. He was astounded, he'd never seen it in real life before, and now he knows. Let the healing begin!
7a7789a69203b323420e5e52561944e4ae7e8b46196fcc76558a3fa02dcad618;;;Disappointed ADHD testing results (that were wrong)- UPDATE;;;[This was my original thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD_partners/comments/f2acgr/disappointing_and_confusing_adhd_test_results/) about my husband's ADHD test results that seemed very wrong and very lacking.  Turns out, they were. He just returned from his first CBT intake appointment, and as the Doctor went over the results, she was shocked at how poorly the testing was constructed. She marked the seven tests he was given and only one was relevant to his needs as an adult but the whole test she felt, was completely wrong and very inaccurate, more geared towards children and intellectual abilities with only one for ADHD.   She also explained that the medications he's on are working against each other directly, and he will need to be weened off of the anti-depressant before they can see the true effects of the Adderall XR, which is likely prescribed at too low a dose for his body type anyway. This explains his terrible sleep and mostly poor results from both meds.  If we get a bill from the testing I'm going to call the doctor and tear him a new one while refusing to pay, and hopefully this new doctor will also talk to his prescribing doctor to find out what on earth she was thinking with his prescriptions.  We started this process in November '18 and that it took this long to get to any kind of result is so, so frustrating. We both feel positive that his CBT Doctor is a great match with a ton of excellent info, and we're hopeful while also being really irritated.  PS - we found her on the [ADDitudes website](https://www.additudemag.com/) so for those struggling to find docs, start there.
7a7789a69203b323420e5e52561944e4ae7e8b46196fcc76558a3fa02dcad618;;;Adjusting to life with spouse on ADHD meds for the first time;;;My husband finally found an great doctor who got him on medication after so much headache. He takes it right when I leave for work in the morning, he works from home, and it wears off around 7 or 8 at night. He's discovering that it's making him more organized and he has clear thoughts now so he's able to get through his work in a much better way. That's great because that's what the medication is for, but when it wears off at night he hits the wall.   Friday night we went out for a nice dinner and evening out but halfway through dinner, he said he could feel the medication wearing off and suddenly he got very distracted and felt like he was crashing. We finished our food and just went home, which was disappointing. He said he's felt like this every night that he's taken the drugs, when they wear off it sets him back a few paces.   I'm hoping this is an adjustment time and it won't be like this forever, but between him being a little speedy and kind of annoying if I'm honest, and being successful with his job, I feel like I should probably just shut up and let it all play out.  How did it go for you when your spouse started on meds?
7a7789a69203b323420e5e52561944e4ae7e8b46196fcc76558a3fa02dcad618;;;Spouse's first doc appt (postponed to today) will cost $250, this is a problem.;;;(Vent) We are fortunate that we can afford it but just barely. And before you ask, yes, we do have insurance but as an hourly contractor and primary earner, the plan I have for us is a terrible one since all costs are out of pocket until we reach our deductible of $5,000. Once we reach that, we'll have a copay but I'm not sure we'll even get there before the year is over, and I'm not sure if the limitations on the mental health feature cover more than a handful of appointments anyway.  Every appointment after this one is $150. We have to max out a vet/medical credit card which was already carrying a balance I was slowly paying off, in order to make these appointments happen for him. While we both know it's so important and not a reason to not get the help he needs, the cost is simply prohibitive for so many. He's upset about it, which is making me upset about it, in spite of the hope these visits will bring. Feeling frustrated, and the insurance company is useless about it.
7a7789a69203b323420e5e52561944e4ae7e8b46196fcc76558a3fa02dcad618;;;Feeling frustrated with my ADHD spouse today;;;Venting.  We rent a house but have to pay the water bill and water fees through the district are insane so we conserve as much as we can. The owner of the home doesn't help us with the lawn upkeep or water bill, so we water when we have to but are careful to put the sprinkler on a timer and not overdo it.   Last night as I was heading to bed, my husband was messing with a new electronic toy and I asked him to be sure to turn the hose spigot off before he came up. He said, 'ok' and I said, 'maybe do it now so you don't forget' and he said, 'I won't forget'.   Guess what happened. I left for work this morning to find the garage door still open and the hose still on. The sprinkler timer had turned off and the water wasn't coming out, but the spigot was open and that likely means we were being charged anyway.   He saw a doctor who gave him a recommendation to a medical doctor so he can get on meds. That was two weeks ago. I've asked him twice to follow up with the first doctor, so he can make an appointment and start this process. He's had bad days at work this week that have some to do with his ADHD, but mostly his anxiety, both of which can be managed with meds and he knows it. But he doesn't make the calls, and in the meantime leaves housework forgotten.   I'm feeling so frustrated and angry at him, even though I try to keep that anger in check because I know the results of the ADHD aren't intentional. Sometimes it doesn't matter and I feel like a mother getting angry at a child. Sometimes my patience and understand reach the ends of their rope and I just feel pissed and unhappy at him. Then I feel guilty.
7a7789a69203b323420e5e52561944e4ae7e8b46196fcc76558a3fa02dcad618;;;Has/did your partner disclose their ADHD to management during a hiring process?;;;I was thinking the other day about whether ADHD is an AMA issue, which works after hire to protect them but what about prior to hire? The question in applications about either accommodations or special concerns for physical/mental health issues seems tricky to disclose at that phase, someone could easily be passed over who doesn't have (or doesn't disclose) their ADHD. How has that worked for your partners?  I'm fairly certain my partner was let go from his job because of factors related to his ADHD, even though they let several other people go in the name of downsizing. They did let him know that it caused some problems for him and for them (they were aware he had it once he was diagnosed after he'd been working there for a while). But I wonder how disclosure can work in a positive way.
7a7789a69203b323420e5e52561944e4ae7e8b46196fcc76558a3fa02dcad618;;;ADHD spouse is finally talking to a doctor about meds next week!;;;It's been a road, spouses and partners. A road and a half. I've only been familiar with (what I now know are) his symptoms for three years but for him, it's been a lifetime.     About two months ago, my husband began to see a therapist who sort of pre-screened him for the potential benefit of ADHD meds. A few sessions ago, she recommended a doctor and he was able to make an appointment, which is happening next week!  He had a few moments in the last few months regarding his work, where he felt like he was too scattered to be of any use and got very down on himself about it. In spite of feeling this way, yesterday his work presented him with a promotion plan where he'll learn a new skill that will be a better fit for him in a company he loves but hasn't been happy in lately. Also next week, we fly to our hometown for his annual work meeting and I'll finally meet these people who see as much value in him that I do. The next trick will be for him to see it in himself, but that's a whole other thing...  We did have a blow up a few weeks ago when he forgot to do something for the house that I'd asked him to, and it resulted in an argument that got a little ugly. We never fight and it's never mean or rude when we do have arguments, but this time it was a little. He apologized immediately, but it gave us a chance to discuss how we both view his ADHD and how we approach it. I told him that while he takes the problems that come along with ADHD as personal failings rather than faulty wiring he can't help, he will be the stop to his own progress. That seemed to stick at least intellectually, but I'm very grateful he has a doctor to help him start to make sense of it all.  Unfortunately, his therapist isn't covered under our insurance and he needs to find a new one. Our new city has zero sense of urgency and it's been beyond frustrating, finding doctors who respond at all let alone fast, so I'm not looking forward to that part, but it's good to know the ball is moving forward! I know it won't all be roses, but I'm so excited for him to have some clarity and focus for the first time in his life!
7a7789a69203b323420e5e52561944e4ae7e8b46196fcc76558a3fa02dcad618;;;Packing to move with an ADHD partner and losing my cool;;;We're moving house tomorrow and today is it for packing. What's partner doing right now? Having a cup of coffee while he waits for something to dry before he can vacuum it. Nothing else during that time, just sitting.   What am I doing? Cleared out and packed four rooms, organized the movers, done the paperwork and found the new place, pet care, cleaning, and trying my hardest not to yell at my partner.  He's done some heavy lifting and made some trips to deal with things, but I feel like I've been going nonstop and stressed over this move while he's taken two weeks to not finish the only two rooms he needs to do, since they're his things in them. He hasn't yet begun to pack his clothing or shoes, his bathroom, or the closets.   He'll stay up til dawn doing this stuff and then the next day wants to take a nap. I told him I'm going to bed early tonight to get up early for the movers but I know that he will still be doing things until 3 in the morning (and none of it will be done to completion).   I'm at the end of my rope and as soon as I bring that to him, he gets hurt and tells me we have different ways of doing things. Yes, I think to myself. I do things while you have coffee.  I'm so frustrated and I feel like I can't get him motivated at all.
7a7789a69203b323420e5e52561944e4ae7e8b46196fcc76558a3fa02dcad618;;;Disappointing and confusing ADHD test results, anyone else experience this?;;;My ADHD husband was tested back in the fall and we just got the results. It was mostly medical-ese so kind of hard to fully understand but the bottom line was, "while he likely had ADHD as a child, he has compensated as an adult and can no longer be diagnosed as having ADHD." Which is infuriating. He has it, 100% convinced that he does, he fits all profiles and symptoms, but because he's learned to live with it and deal with it, they think the symptoms are now masked?! Is this why there's so little out there about adult ADHD?  He still reached out to CBT coaches and therapists to review the results since he was told he had to have them in order to get in the door, and my suspicion is that they have seen those kinds of results before, and the symptoms are what they are so they need attention. The testing is I think the ticket into CBT but not the end result. It was just so frustrating to go through the expensive testing and then get such an unclear result, and we're stuck waiting for the doctors in our area to call us back, which they never do.
7a7789a69203b323420e5e52561944e4ae7e8b46196fcc76558a3fa02dcad618;;;Do you go into the ADHD sub to defend NT partners?;;;I notice quite often that few vent threads go by without at least one ADHD voice appearing to explain or defend the issue at hand. How do we as a community of non-ADHD partners feel when that happens? Personally, I wouldn't go to a thread in that community if someone is venting, it feels somewhat irrelevant and dismissive when it happens here, anyone else?
7a7789a69203b323420e5e52561944e4ae7e8b46196fcc76558a3fa02dcad618;;;For those whose partners are medicated, are they also going to therapy? Is it helping?;;;And what did it take for you to get them to that point (or did they get there themselves)? I've been slowly encouraging my spouse to start seeking a therapist now that we have insurance coverage but he's not taking the initiative, and my therapist explained to me the other day that meds and therapy *have* to walk hand-in-hand or it won't work and they'll just up his meds. That has already happened at least twice, maybe a third time. His prescribing doctor may or may not be encouraging therapy, I don't know. I just know that without the tools learned there, the meds are only working halfway and it's not really helping our home or our life together.
