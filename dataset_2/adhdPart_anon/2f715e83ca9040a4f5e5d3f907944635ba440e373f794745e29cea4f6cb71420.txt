He is going to get diagnosed on Monday and hopefully medication from there. I'm going to talk to someone as well  due to the amount of resentment I have.  Our relationship was amazing until we bought our house. Then he completely changed. He became lazy, starting blowing through money, wouldn't listen to me, we have a lack of intimacy and now we are in different rooms.   I want to be hopeful and work on us but I am so exhausted and there have been so many issues that have happened, how do you move past them? Can you move past them?
2f715e83ca9040a4f5e5d3f907944635ba440e373f794745e29cea4f6cb71420;;;[Advice] I [27F] am now looking at divorcing my [26M] DX husband;;;I am finally at the point where divorce looks like the only option. My husband was diagnosed in September, took medication for a week then stopped and has made no attempts to go back to the doctor. I decided to go to therapy to help cope with this and other traumas. We do have couples counselling at the end of the month but I still don't believe anything will change. He seems to be forgetting things more often and shuts down my feelings. I found fingernail clippings sitting in the sink, chewing tobacco left out which was in the reach of our puppy,  then this weekend he left the front door of our home unlocked and cracked open. Anytime I approach these situations, I am met with similar responses  of "I know" or "I'm sorry."  I can't be a mother to my partner anymore. I can't handle being called ridiculous when I try to talk about my feelings or have someone  throw a fit when they can't find their keys. I've lost all attraction and have voiced my feelings numerous times. I'm told I need to be more understanding of ADHD, yet he does nothing to help and claims he has it under control.     Has anyone else's marriage failed due to their partner not realizing the toll it takes?
