Is this an excuse or a valid need?;;;My boyfriend (diagnosed ADHD partner) and I (non ADHD), in the grand scheme of things, are doing well. We laugh together, do important things together. But the one area we are constantly getting stuck in right now is communication. Granted, our communication styles are different  as he is more extroverted and I am introverted.  So a typical conversation will start with me talking about a college exam I aced and other little things about my day. And he will be fidgeting on his phone or staring at screens or looking at the fan and responding with minimal yes and nos. And then when he wants to talk, he says things like, "look look look at what I did! Come here and see this thing I did!" And I will utilize every fiber of my being to engage and focus on what he is doing.  It just seems unfair.  I give him 100% attention and he gives me about 60% while looking at something else. (He explicitly told me this) and when he wants my attention he wants 100% of it and I do. Sometimes I want to give him a taste of what it feels like. He isn't sassy or manipulative. He cried telling me that he has tried all his life to not let the condition ruin relationships of all kinds. He currently isn't medicated but he was when he was a teenager. He didn't like it because he said it made him feel dead   I feel hurt, I feel like it isn't fair, but yet I'm trying to understand. I feel defeated because I don't know if I am willing to submit to this for the rest of my life.  Any advice?
