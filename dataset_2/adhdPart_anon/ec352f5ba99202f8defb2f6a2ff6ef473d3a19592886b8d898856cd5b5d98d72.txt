Then when I say that didn’t happen ‘yeah well I feel..’ it’s starting to really confuse me.
ec352f5ba99202f8defb2f6a2ff6ef473d3a19592886b8d898856cd5b5d98d72;;;I feel like I do everything I’m tired of this;;;I (22f) do everything for my boyfriend(26m) we have been together 4 years, I work 9 hours a day, I come home, I clean, I cook I listen to the ‘oh I’ll cook tomorrow i promise’ all he does all day is sit on his PS4 and rage, I have to ask him to not cuss when I’m on calls. He isn’t working at the moment as he was made redundant and that set him into a depression spiral and now it’s ‘I will look for work when lockdown is over’. I’m tired of this, I cook most if not all days if I didn’t we wouldn’t eat or just have take away everyday, I clean even though he isn’t working and I also bought a big to do list thing that he wanted and he still doesn’t do his jobs. I am also working and running about after him and I’m tired of it. I am 22 he is 26 he acts like a child, all the broken promises, nothing ever changes, he gives money for rent and buys the shopping but j have to write the lists, even when he cooks he comes to me and I have to list if we have it or not, or washing up I do it ALL. Sorry for the rant I’m tired we have been together 4 years. Whenever I talk to him he is never really listening, I am constantly shut out by him and I really am starting to think what am I getting out of this? He would rather watch a YouTube video on the game he’s on all day then talk to me
ec352f5ba99202f8defb2f6a2ff6ef473d3a19592886b8d898856cd5b5d98d72;;;No help when sick, no communication at all;;;( I was the one who pushed for him to go see someone as I have a brother with adhd so I kinda know the signs and I also have a psychology degree. He is medicated.)   I am losing patience, My (21f) diagnosed adhd boyfriend (26) of 3 years does literally nothing around the house at all. whenever I communicate this to him he gets extremely defensive and brings up the one time he washed up 2 weeks ago.  This is all made worse by the fact I’m extremely sick (Crohn’s disease) I’ve had 5 surgeries this year the last one November the 2nd and he still doesn’t help. Once, whilst I was in hospital he was out with his friends and sold his car when I needed daily nursing appointments for dressings, I had to move in with my parents because he did nothing and I was so sick. I take at home injections and other immunosuppressives that make me feel literally terrible and he still doesn’t help clean, he uses every room like a dressing room so his clothes are everywhere.   I cook, I clean I do the washing and I work all day, he isn’t working at the moment because he had two many lates at work and was made redundant. It’s been a week and he hasn’t looked around or called anyone, if I bring this up I have my face eaten off. All he does all day 15 hours + is play video games, with his friends, he can barely string a sentence to me but talks to his friends 15 hours a day. I can’t talk to him about money, work anything without a defensive response. The majority of the time But get ignored. When he talks to me he talks over me and I don’t get to speak at all.   I don’t think I can do this anymore.
