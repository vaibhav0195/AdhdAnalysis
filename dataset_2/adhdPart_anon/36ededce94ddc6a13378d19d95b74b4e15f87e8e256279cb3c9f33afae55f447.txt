We even opened our relationship (which has led to greater communication), but he STILL did it without telling me. Literally our one rule is to loop eachother in.   I have put my foot down and said that we keep going through this cycle where he does something, I find out, it hurt me, I forgive him because I know what his struggles are, and then we are ok. He truly is a lovely soul. But then it happens again and I am realizing I am now fucking paranoid and the trust is gone. I hate this version of myself.  He is finally starting counseling. I am so happy. But I keep feeling like I don't know if the hurt and broken trust runs too deep.  Has anyone had a similar situation and seen real change with an intervention? I hate to be skeptical but I know by now that what he consciously says and subconsciously does are two different animals.
