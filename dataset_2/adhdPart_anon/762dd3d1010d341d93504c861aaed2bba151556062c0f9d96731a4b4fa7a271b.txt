He was diagnosed ADHD as a child, on no prescribed medication. He's very successful in his career, is a present and loving father. In general we're a happy couple, been together 5 years.  He used to smoke a larger quantities and since the baby agreed to micro dose, generally 4/5 times a day.     If he doesn't get to smoke he becomes anxious and fidgety.  He also surfs regularly, I imagine helps his stress. Should I be concerned that my husband is a functional addict? He said he'll stop but I seriously doubt he could on his own.  Should I just stop scratching at this itch?
