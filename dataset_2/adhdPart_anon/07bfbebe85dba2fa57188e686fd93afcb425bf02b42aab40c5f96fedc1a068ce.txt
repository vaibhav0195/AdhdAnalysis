07bfbebe85dba2fa57188e686fd93afcb425bf02b42aab40c5f96fedc1a068ce;;;He just won't learn.;;;I love him so much, but living with him is so difficult. We've been lving together for years and we are still having the same conversations over and over again because he'll have forgotten all about them the next time. About how if we have an agreement about something, it's not okay for him to ask me for permission to break that agreement because he's feeling too lazy to keep his word that day. About how if I start a sentence with "I feel" it's insensitive to reply with "that's not true". About how if he says he'll do something and my response is to ask if he's sure he'll remember, it's not okay to get irritated with me because 90% of the time he doesn't remember.  I just want him to admit to himself how forgetful he is so we can start working with it, finding ways to make it not be a problem together. But he's adamant, every time, that he will remember. He almost never does! This makes it impossible to make any progress and I keep having to explain the same things. He always says he understands how I feel, but the next time, sometimes as soon as the next day, he'll do the exact same thing again! And I have to explain the same shit, again! It's just so hard.. :'(
