He’s able to be very organized and successful at work-so much that it borders on obsession.  But when he comes home, and on his off days... I feel unseen. Unless he’s rambling.   He’s into both gardening and fish keeping which actually were originally my hobbies, that he slowly took over and now info dumps me on. I partially resent the hobbies now because of this. It wasn’t just my fish tank- we now have 4. And something is always wrong with one of them, they always need the new this or that, and most of the time his hyper focusing on it causes him to cause more problems. He is awake until sometimes 2am just talking my ear off about it and it’s so difficult to politely tell him to stop.  I can’t even COUNT how many nights I made a wonderful dinner or picked out a movie and heard the ‘I’ll be there is a second... give me 5 minutes.’ Just to go to bed without him and hear the next day he forgot to put the food away. Or he actually sits down for a movie and then gets up multiple times and tells me ‘I’m paying attention dont worry’ yet then proceeds to talk every 10 minutes and ask me what’s happening.  He will probably never be able to give me a massage etc because he says it bores him. I’m just feeling so frustrated that I’m not interesting enough most of the time to have undivided attention.  And don’t get me started on talking- he’s fantastic at derailing conversations, interrupting me, and not pausing for me to interject. This seriously makes me want to rethink dating someone with ADD again.   How can I talk to him and help him understand this? Is there a way? Is there anything else I should do?  He’s very sensitive about this but I feel like he doesn’t have the capacity to just be in the moment with me.
