He has a family history, ADHD books we read sum him up, and our relationship problems are eerily similar to those of partners with ADHD. I'm trying to break the habit we've formed of me being his reminder for everything. He's going to try to forum is own routine without me reminding him. If that doesn't work we are going to look into a psychologist to see about him being diagnosed. For those whose partners were officially diagnosed as adults did it make a difference? Were there improvements of symptoms? What treatments or strategies did diagnosis open? Thanks!

My boyfriend who has never been officially diagnosed with ADHD, but has a lot of the characteristics, absentmindedly sings a lot of the time. He doesn't even realize he is doing it. I've tried asking him to put sticky notes up before I nap, but he just can't seem to stop. He feels bad when I tell him that I can't sleep, but he forgets and starts singing again. Short of earplugs does anyone have any advice? We have pets who constantly move around so we also can't close the bedroom door.
