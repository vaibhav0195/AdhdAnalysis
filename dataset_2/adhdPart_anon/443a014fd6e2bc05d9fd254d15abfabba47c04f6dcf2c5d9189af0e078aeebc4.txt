443a014fd6e2bc05d9fd254d15abfabba47c04f6dcf2c5d9189af0e078aeebc4;;;Partner in denial;;;My partner (30F) and I (30M) are close to the end. She got her diagnosis about 9 months ago but I had no idea about how significant of a disorder it was. I truly thought it was just about her needing help focusing at work. After finding this sub and reading everyone's issues, all of our struggles seem so much clearer to me. Her inability to do certain chores. Forgetting to check in on me when we're apart. Aversion to touch. So many things that made me feel hurt and unloved now have an obvious cause. I felt such hope because now that I get the context of our problems, they seem solvable.  Except, I brought up the connections I was making between her behavior and ADHD and she completely rejected me. She refused to consider that what we struggle with is because of ADHD. She told me I should  just love her the way she is regardless of why she did things. I feel crazy. Things seem so obviously connected, and with all the books out there it seems completely fair that a couple would need to specifically address ADHD in the relationship. Her diagnosis is new so I guess she is just starting her personal journey understanding it, but I'm very sad that we may not be able to continue just when things started to seem fixable. Has anyone else encountered this kind of resistance to making connections between the diagnosis and relationship issues?
