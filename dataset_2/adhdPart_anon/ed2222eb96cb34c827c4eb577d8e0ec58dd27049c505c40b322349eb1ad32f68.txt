While dating we almost broke up over fights. I now know it was his RSD but that don’t change anything. Hurt still hurt. I wasn’t used to arguments and yelling and nasty comments.  My parents didn’t fight in front of me (I was a super sensitive kid and would freak out n hide under tables). My dad had/has undx untx ADHD so he also had quick triggers but was older and more tired by the time I came along. I mostly got the emotionally unavailable side and you never knew when he would randomly lose his crap, but it was pretty rare (mostly happened in my teens). His parents scream and yelled and called each other everything but the son of God. His mother (who passed away before we met) seems like she was the emotionally unstable one, bad temper, impulsive, verbally abusive. He has other close family members who have really nasty, disrespectful fights. So this was all normal for him. But it wasn’t for me. And I told him when we were dating that every nasty fight like that would break me just a little bit. And when I almost left, the fights stopped! I believed when he said he would change and be better. And they did! Until after we were engaged and right before the wedding. I knew what I was getting into. I made my bed, I accept that. I married my dad. The fights and nasty comments are so much better than they were, but I think that first year really broke me. Then the losing interest in me a couple years later broke me further. My question is, have any of you ever found your way back to the old you while still with your partner? I’m in therapy and I’ve shopped around therapists looking for one to help *me* and not try to therapy him through me (it’s actually pretty difficult idk why, they all just wanna get their hands on him). Was there a specific type of therapy that worked for you? Do I need to see someone who specializes in ADHD? . TL;DR I miss the old pre ADHD partner me, is getting back possible without leaving them?
ed2222eb96cb34c827c4eb577d8e0ec58dd27049c505c40b322349eb1ad32f68;;;Boundaries;;;So I’m on the part in The ADHD Effect on Marriage about boundaries and I’m curious, what boundaries have you and your ADHD spouse set? We discussed always showing respect, even when we’re upset and using the phrase “can you rephrase that?” when we feel like the other isn’t saying something respectful. And then my personal boundary is to ask “do you want advice or for me to just listen” because it’s in my nature to jump in and help out even when it’s not asked (co dependent family traits yay). I’m also toying with some wording of my happiness depends upon me but not sure how to phrase it. Basically I’m trying to work myself back to a person I like and can be proud of again (see previous post about being my old self)   TL;DR What boundaries hace you guys set together and/or separately
ed2222eb96cb34c827c4eb577d8e0ec58dd27049c505c40b322349eb1ad32f68;;;Appreciation;;;I just want to express how happy I am I found you all. I’ve cried multiple times reading different posts and comments because I finally feel seen. It’s hard explaining this to those outside the situation w out them judging him harshly. But here....I finally don’t feel crazy! I don’t feel like I’m some evil biznotch trying to make him feel like the worse person ever. For years he’s said my depression isn’t his fault. But I wasn’t this depressed before marriage. My anxiety wasn’t this bad. I wasn’t so flinchy. I never screamed at anyone. I’ve change so much in efforts to protect my own ego from when he verbally lashes out because he feels threatened. It’s a bitter sweet feeling because things could have been so much different if we had all this information 10 years ago. Honestly 50 years ago! I been sharing some of the resources I’m finding here and she’s like wow....this woulda saved so much heartache. Once she hit menopause, she almost left so he finally got medicated (not for the ADHD, but anxiety and depression, didn’t want to pay to get full work up dx 🙄). Then I turned around and married my dad 😅 But hopefully now, it’s know better do better. I keep trying to react less and be proactive. Hopefully I can convince him to get help. I emailed him that lovely blog post about adhd and married men in denial. Just gotta work up the courage to tell him I sent him an email cuz the last two weekends there have been fights and I’m not in the mood for another.
