He says he does that because dealing with the after effects is hard for him. I noticed that after he takes the meds for a couple of days, his mood changes, he gets irritated easily, don’t get anything done, withdraw... I was wondering if it would be better to take the meds every day? Or it’s normal to do it only when needed?  He takes adderal.
