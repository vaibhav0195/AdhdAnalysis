He is a separated father with his son 50% of the time. My boyfriend doesn't have an official diagnosis, but he does have all the symptoms and characteristics of ADHD.  His son has diagnosed ADHD.   I'm getting very frustrated by the lack of planning and routine that goes in our daily life.  Things like planning dinner, what to cook, who is cooking, are constant sources of stress for me because he doesn't plan for that.  Before I met him, a lot of his meals were fast food because he rarely planned for meals.  I think meals together at home is important and more more healthy and budget friendly.    Another issue is that even though I ask, he never plans a date.  Or he will book his massage on a Friday evening that he doesn't have his son that would have been perfect for a date.  I text him during the day to ask and he forgets.   We don't live together yet so we don't have a routine.  I also don't want to default to me having to do all the cooking and meal planning because he doesn't do it.  I have cooked before sometimes when he said he didn't have anything, only to find out he had already agreed to something else with his son, which results in frustration for everybody.   I guess this was a lot of rambling. I am a very routine based person and I hate all this uncertainty.
