When we first started dating I was especially taken by their positivity and candour and we quickly moved in, got engaged, and got married (less than 8 months from first date to “I do”). While we had our problems, and hindsight being what it is, there were a lot of signs of RSD and ADHD that were ignored, we otherwise unknowingly “managed” despite the difficulties. However, it wasn’t until the pandemic, when things between us got their worst, that they were finally diagnosed.  Complicating matters is that we both had traumatic childhood experience that included abandonment, neglect, and emotional abuse, resulting in us both having anxious-preoccupied attachment styles (adults with this style of attachment seek high levels of intimacy, approval, and responsiveness from their attachment figure). So basically, ADHD/PI can and does cause my partner to fail to connect with me emotionally in the exact way I need them to. When I try to talk to them about it, the conversation quickly goes back to it being an effect of the ADHD. Broken as I am, I’m still here.  I just want to feel like I, as an individual, matter to the people I should the most. But I don’t. At this point, I only really seem to matter when I make a fuss. Otherwise, things are great when I keep my mouth shut. I guess I just don’t know what to do - I’ve had dark days and dark thoughts, and I want this to work, but how am I expected to do so when I feel so lonely and sad and it’s caused by someone I love who’s not doing it on purpose?!? I don’t understand.  Thanks for letting me vent.
