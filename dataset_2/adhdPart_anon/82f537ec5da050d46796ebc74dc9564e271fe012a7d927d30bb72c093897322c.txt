Our tiny, delicate dog, an Italian greyhound, didn’t want to go to her right away because she was freaking him out trying to swat mosquitoes away. Once she got a hold of him, she tossed him onto the porch and it caused him to break his leg (he had just recovered from his other leg being broken from a yard mishap tripping or stumbling). She knows he is very fragile and to never do something like that, but she said she just “didn’t think”. She says that for a lot of the things she does that cost us sanity and/or money.   I’m really upset about the whole thing because it never should’ve happened. She promises it will never happen again, but you know how that goes. Now we have another $1,500 bill when we are barely getting by as it is, and our poor little dog had to go through so much suffering and trauma AGAIN. I’m not sure if we should make a rule that she’s never allowed to touch him, or that he should just be rehomed as it’s too dangerous for him with her around.  I’m really looking for suggestions and feedback here...I just don’t know what to do about her anymore.
