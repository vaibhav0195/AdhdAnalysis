What do I do?;;;New user here and pretty nervous about being this vocal with strangers on the Internet but here goes: I’m frustrated with my boyfriend’s (DX/26) laziness. He sleeps all day and then immediately gets up, goes to his computer and plays video games well into the night. Meanwhile I have to do all of the cooking, cleaning, taking care of the animals (2 cats and a dog that he insisted he wanted and paid for and barely takes care of even after i straight up said that he is not in a good headspace right now to take care of a dog) all while I’m working a full time job and working towards my masters full time.   When I point it out to him he will say “oh well my ADHD makes everything harder!! You need to tell me what to do!” but all this does is add another burden to me and even when I do this he either says he’ll do what I asked later and not do it or he’ll half ass whatever task I ask him to do and still leave me to go behind him and clean/reclean. He said that having a guide would help so I got him a white board to write these tasks on: he either ignores it or (like he did last night) draw over what I’ve written to be funny.  I love him very much but I’m at the end of my rope and seriously thinking of leaving him. I’m tired of being his mother and having to hold his hand through the simplest of tasks—seriously I have to actually tell him to not throw trash on the floor and to put it in the trash can.   Any advice is welcomed and I’d be grateful for. Thanks.

We’ve been quarantining together and he wants me to move in, but he’s so messy that idk if I can deal. He does stuff like cook and leave dishes out for days claiming he’ll get to it later, he lets dishes and clothes pile up in all places...when i try to talk to him about it he blames his ADHD and gets defensive (yes he’s medicated and takes it on schedule) it feels like an excuse if anything and like I’m the one responsible for cleaning constantly. We keep having fights about it and all he can say is “I’ll get better” but he isn’t doing anything to do so. I’ve gotten a White board to write reminders, ive texted them to him, I even did sticky notes all over the places in the apartment he goes to all the time. I don’t know what else to do, but I’m thinking of breaking up with him. I am exhausted trying to take care of him and everything then do my stuff too. It feels like I’m a mom taking care of a kid. Please help.
