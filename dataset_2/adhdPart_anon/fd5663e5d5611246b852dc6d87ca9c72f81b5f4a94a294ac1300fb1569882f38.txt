Wife (28, DX) was diagnosed just before we started dating 4 years ago. She's never been medicated or otherwise done much about it. She lost a job that was meaningful to her because of it, but other than that she hasn't really seen it's affect on her life. Until we had 2 kids and now she can't keep up with laundry, cleaning, kids, etc. as a housewife. It wasn't even something we talked about until this year. It took a few months of angry arguments until she finally started coming around to the fact that it affects our lives. She's now accepted her diagnosis better, but she's never been able to bounce back from it. She's started getting really depressed like she can't change anything, and now all she ever says is that she needs to start over somehow. I have no idea how to respond to that. She used to deal with her problems by traveling or otherwise running away, but she can't do that now. I keep trying to push her to see a therapist and she agrees she should, but she can't even focus long enough to make an appointment. I guess this is more of a rant than a call for help, but it just sucks.
