My boyfriend and I have been dating for a year and a half, and he’s diagnosed with adhd. He has inattentive ADHD and has a lot of trouble listening to conversation, following orders, remembering things, or being present to spend time with others. He normally spends his time “owning” conservatives on Facebook and generally being on his phone a majority of his day. We’ve had a lot of relationship issues due to his inability to be present in the relationship and meet my needs for basic affection and conversation. Anyways, his friends and family make similar complaints to him and ask him to please listen to instructions, not go on his phone at every opportunity, and to not be so reactive. But he speaks as if EVERYONE ELSE is the problem, saying things like “so and so is so critical of me for no reason. Why do they have to nag me like that, it’s mean“. But he fails to understand that if everyone is having the same complaints, the only common denominator is him. He can’t internally review his actions and see why he may have hurt others and their “criticism” is just a desperate plea to be treated like they matter. Has anyone else experienced this with their partner??? I’m getting frustrated and can’t even start to explain to him why these are happening, as he will blow up on me and I don’t want to deal with that
