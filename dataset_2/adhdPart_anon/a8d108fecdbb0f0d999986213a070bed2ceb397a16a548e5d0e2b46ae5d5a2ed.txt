Me (27f) and my partner 28m DX) have been going out for 2 and a half years. We live together.  We’ve had rocky relationship but managed to sort things out (communicating properly etc) later last year. It was wonderful and really felt like we were doing very well, communicating well, I was so proud of us! fast forward to now we’ve just had our first big giant argument since we’ve been doing well and the last week has felt like how we used to be and  I’m starting to feel really disrespected again with how he’s communicating with me.  Today he grabbed me to make a point (I accidentally hurt while kissing his neck and sucking lol) him and was playing around and thought he was playing around too when he said it hurt, then he went to grab me and said ‘don’t worry, I’m going to kiss you like you did, it won’t hurt’ in a very... nasty and condescending way.   So this sort of snarky, sarcastic, condescending way that he’s communicating was how he used to communicate with me and I’ve seen it over the last week pop up multiple times again which is worrying.  I’ve communicated my feelings, I’ve shared how I’ve noticed it again and it’s worrying me. I’ve recently started to get upset and today I got angry because it just wouldn’t stop and it felt like I was talking about something really quite important and it went in one ear and out the other.   I really just need some guidance. We’re not good right now and I’ve just been balling my eyes out, I’m so so worried this old, disrespectful partner is coming back and our relationship will turn toxic again after us both being so proud of how far we came.   Thanks for reading this! Sorry it’s so much, just need to get it off my chest, feeling lost.
