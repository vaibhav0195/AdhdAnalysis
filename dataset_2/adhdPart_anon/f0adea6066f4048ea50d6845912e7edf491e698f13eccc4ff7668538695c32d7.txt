Hes got all the markers and many of the issues we have faced in our marriage make a lot of sense now. The anger outbursts, inattentiveness, 'laziness', the mess! But recently, his anger and his inability to just...shut up sometimes is driving me to my tipping point.   His sarcasm, remarks and constant swearing and hurling abuse my way is driving me insane. Just today, I was heading out to run an errand for him. But instead of just...you know being chilled out, he shouted and screamed at me for wearing the wrong clothes, not listening to his instructions on things he told me to do in the past, and then eventually blaming me for all of his problems since the day he met me. How I ruined his life. I am just exhausted.   I struggle with anxiety myself, and often I just paralyse myself with overthinking and then never getting anything done which is, a topic of many arguments. For some reason when it concerns my shortcomings I can be criticised till kingdom come. But should the table turn, he will not have it. I'm seeing the same therapist, who gave me some tips on how to work with Hubby and manage my expectations as an ADHD spouse. But it's so hard, it drains and grates on me everyday. Hes so loving sometimes but then in a heartbeat he becomes so vicious and so incredibly unkind. You know the feeling when you feel so hurt and sad, you dont even make a sound when you cry, the tears just sorta roll out. And you feel defeated. This is my reality now.   Does anybody else feel this way? Has anybody gone through therapy, or started medication and seen improvements in their relationships?
