The fact that there is even a thread on the “quirks” you love about your adhd partner (things i figured were annoying..leaving the phone in the fridge!!!!) and how to quietly help throughout the day makes me feel so much more hope. Thank you for the extra patience and seeing your partner’s adhd as a not only tolerable but perhaps even interesting and unique and lovable. Again, thank you.   If you have any personal questions you would like to ask that you feel might come off the wrong way to your partner, feel free to ask me.  I. E.  “Why does he do this?” “What does it feel like when you?” “How can i confront them on this?” “Whats a date activity you enjoy that doesn’t require long term focus?”  Hopefully I can be as helpful as you all!
