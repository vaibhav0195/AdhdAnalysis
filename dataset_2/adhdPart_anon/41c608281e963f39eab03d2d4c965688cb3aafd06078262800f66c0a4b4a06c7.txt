I love him to pieces but struggle with having sex once every few months (if that) and when we do there is no foreplay (or very little, 20 seconds) and he's in and out because he can't stay hard so he has to I guess, get it done quickly. Because we have such little sex, it always hurts me when we do. So there's really not much pleasure in it for me. He has a low sex drive &amp; erectile dysfunction due to the medication he takes for his adhd.  I have never and will never take it out on him but I was wondering if anyone has been in or is in a similar situation and what advice you could give me? Countless times he has told me that he needs to put more effort in and take the viagra his Dr prescribed him but I don't know if that's fair on him either.  Without his medication he has a high sex drive apparently. I've told him he should try to change his medication (as he is having other side effects too) but he brushes it off and says there isn't a lot out there. I'm sure that's true but I just wish that weren't the case. I hope this doesn't come across as rude, I truly love with with all of my heart but I can't help but feel frustrated at the situation :(   Thank you so much
