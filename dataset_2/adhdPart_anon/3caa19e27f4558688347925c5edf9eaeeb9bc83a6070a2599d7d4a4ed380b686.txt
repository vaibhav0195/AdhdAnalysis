But it can also be a reminder of the loneliness we all feel from time to time.  So today I wanted to say thank you.  Thank you for everything you do for your partners  Thank you for sticking by them during times when it would have been easier to walk away  Thank you for all of the accommodations, considerations, and daily emotional labor spent making their lives a little bit easier  You may never hear these things from your own partner. But I'd be willing to bet a fair number of them are so grateful to have your support.  And if they're not, well, maybe you can start turning that love inward. Celebrate yourself today and appreciate yourself. It takes a special sort of person to weather challenges like this and I'm so glad we have a space where we can all come together and grow.  Happy Valentine's Day
