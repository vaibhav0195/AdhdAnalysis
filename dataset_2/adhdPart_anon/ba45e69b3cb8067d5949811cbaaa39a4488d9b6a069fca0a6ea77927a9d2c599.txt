ba45e69b3cb8067d5949811cbaaa39a4488d9b6a069fca0a6ea77927a9d2c599;;;Wedding photos;;;I got married to my ADHD partner in March. Prior to us marrying, he was a widower. Because he has a large family (I don't), he wanted to purchase a bigger wedding package that what I wanted, so we did and split the cost. The package included 125 wedding photos, which came out lovely.  For 7 months now, I've asked ***repeatedly*** for us to sit down and select which photo will be our signature couple photo to hang up, which pictures will go into a photo album and which pictures will go to family/friends--some who traveled for hours to attend our wedding.  Long story short, the wedding photos are still on a flash drive 7 months later. This, coupled with the fact that last week he said he wanted to post a social media tribute on what would have been his wedding anniversary to his late wife (I put my foot down and said that was not acceptable) makes me feel like I'm not very important to him. (I also had to ask him to take down his wedding photo with his late wife.)  The last time I brought up the wedding photos, he said they weren't up yet because I hadn't "sat" him down to go over them. He is really special to me and I try to accommodate his needs and wants, so I don't understand why he won't pay attention to our photos. Is this an ADHD thing, or is something else going on?
