I'm a first time poster here and I've started to get more romantically involved with a girl who is DX with ADD/ADHD and I having severe Anxiety it has been a wild few months.   Background to how this happened our families have known each other for upwards of 20 years and we have known about each other for a couple years but only really started talking a few months ago and admitting that we liked each other about a month ago now.   She has recently had a bad breakup and some drama with another guy as a result of that messy breakup and over time of me helping her through it we started to slowly get more attracted to each other but due to our working shifts and bad weather (Midwest Bipolar weather) we haven't really been able to get together outside the hour Id see her at work before she would leave for the day. We have Facetimed a couple times when we had free time and text each other just about everyday.  I in the past had dated an ADD/ADHD (dx) and that was a really messy one relationship and if left me with a lot of doubt in my head. I've been seeing the same patterns again i.e Me leading conversations or more often me being the one to imitate the conversations but at the same time she does go out of her way to ask how I am and how my day is which my ex didn't do.  To save myself rambling too much I guess to put it that my bad past experience coupled with my anxiety has been really keeping my in a negative mindset from enjoying what could be something really good and I'm just unsure of how I should proceed forward.
