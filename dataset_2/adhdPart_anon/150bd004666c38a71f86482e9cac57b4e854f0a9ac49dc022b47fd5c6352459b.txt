I love my boyfriend from the bottom of my heart and the first months were the best of my life. I got so much love and  it feels like I finally found someone who understands me in a deep deep way. And he felt the same way.   But it  started to change. I don\`t know how to deal with the ADD and it drives me crazy. He isn´t that attentive and sweet anymore and I often feel like I´m  unnecessary and lonley while Im with him. He focused on other things and  drift away with thoughts. And seems to lost the interest to spend time with me after an hour  or 2.  Before that I was the priority and he wanted to be with me  7/24, but know he wanna be alone most of the time and that\`s okay .Don\`t get me wrong, I know its a normal and healthy thing to have me- time and didnt see the partner all the time but if we meet, he\`s overwhelmed fast and want to be alone again  That hurts..  he said thats a phase and that comes and goes and  I dont know how to handle these situations. I feel like I cant make him as happy as before.   I had no issues with the ADD before. I clean up everything, handle all the stuff he forgot. Have understading for the things he miss. Support him all the time.  But I really dont know how to deal with the mood swings. Sometimes he´s depressive and even didn\`t  know why. I really wants to help him but he seems to be okay with that as long as hes alone. Im worried about him and the situation. Should I just waint ? How can I be there for him? And how can I deal with that feeling of unnecessary while he has these phases?   Has anyone experience with that kind of mood swings?
