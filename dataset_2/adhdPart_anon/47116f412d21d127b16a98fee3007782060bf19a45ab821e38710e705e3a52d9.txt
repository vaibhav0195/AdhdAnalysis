I do everything else, with a 15 month old. He occasionally is good about stepping up and doing something for her, but almost always I have to ask him to do any other task in the house....and although the theory is that he mows the lawn/shovels the snow...he doesn’t unless I ask.   So, here’s this mornings scenario. Lots of dirty dishes from over the holidays and we don’t have a dishwasher...so I’m trying to get everything caught up, we hosted Christmas twice this week, and he wants to play the Xbox. I asked him to please do the dishes before he plays the Xbox and he got offended.   I know games are his thing, I read, he plays video games. And he’s good about not playing all the time because that was an issue when the kid was tiny....but how do I handle this?  I’ve posted before...I end up feeling like I’m some overbearing mother because I ask him to wait to play Xbox until he’s does something around the house.   How do I get him to understand that I’m not trying to be controlling but I know that if he sits down to play Xbox he will be at it for several hours and by then it’ll be nap time and he won’t be able to do the dishes because it’s right by the bedroom...

He doesn’t banter back and forth with me. In fact if I’m still talking about it and he’s done he’ll just start talking about something else. It’s really frustrating to me because I enjoy talking about politics or debating things but he doesn’t even listen to what I have to say. But then he’ll also do this “no it isn’t” where he’ll argue that the sky is green simply to argue that it’s green.   It’s embarrassing in public when he’ll talk right over other people. I get so tired of telling him to let me or someone talk.  Idk. I’m so frustrated. He’s fighting being diagnosed and this is really destroying our marriage.
