My partner today said they believe they have ADHD and was planning on speaking to his GP next week. He is a wonderful human who I love endlessly. He only let me know as I was sharing some of my feelings about our relationship with him. He said he wasn’t planning on telling me but it just blurted out.   I’ve just did some research and I would say yes, some thing makes sense if he is diagnosed with it. In the meantime, what can I do to help him? I’ve asked if he wants to talk or me to go with him to the appointment but he said he wants to do it alone.  He believes his ADHD is exacerbating his anxiety and depression. Which to be honest I didn’t think were troubling him that much, I feel like he has been struggling alone with everything as I didn’t realise things were really bad at the moment until he divulged today. I feel awful as I thought he was being lazy, bored and a man child in our relationship but perhaps there is more to it.   Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!
