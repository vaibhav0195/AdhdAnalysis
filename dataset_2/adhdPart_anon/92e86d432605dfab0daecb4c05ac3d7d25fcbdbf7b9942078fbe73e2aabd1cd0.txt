92e86d432605dfab0daecb4c05ac3d7d25fcbdbf7b9942078fbe73e2aabd1cd0;;;Partner has trouble coping with how upset she gets with me.;;;My (21m) partner (22f) has been having trouble with my increase in symptoms over the last three weeks. Long story short, I quit my job on doctors orders and they cancelled my Heath insurance sooner than they should have because they switched companies so to get my adderal 15mg xr and 10mg regular it would have cost me over 300$. So I did what any other broke college kid would do the week before finals. I buckled down and made the 8 or so 10mgs I had last me for finals week. I’ve been out for about two weeks but I will have insurance on the first, so there’s a light. My partner is having a hard time because we’ve been on and off for about 6 years, and I would always get more inattentive, agitated, tired, and impulsive before breaking things off, but I was also always untreated. Tonight we talked and argued and eventually she made me realize that I never told her how bad the withdrawals from this medication can be (catch 2200 amiright). So I did that and she was really down on herself for saying I wasn’t being attentive enough and other things. How can I let her know that we’re just going through this together, and that her feelings are justified (aside from just telling her because I have and will continue to do that)? Like, I appreciate her apologizing, but how can I let her know that she’s not as bad as she’s making herself out to be?  Thanks in advance!
