fbb3f54f5621a08ee13ffb68ba0125a7998be2ce2a42d0c815695d1a22dbe0ad;;;I found a Home here!!!!;;;Just dropping a line to say I didn't even know this sub existed and I feel like I'm home ðŸ¥°. Husband is on the verge of a diagnosis after 12 years. I've been saying for years hes probably ADD (i work with traumatized youth) and hes finally agreed to seek help. Its been a journey but were finally getting somewhere. All of the stories I've been reading and comments from other spouses are like moments from our life. I'm so grateful to have found you!!  I didn't see one but can someone let me know what your acronyms are? Add/adhd are self explanatory but not sure what some of the other ones are. TIA
