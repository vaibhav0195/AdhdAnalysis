I don't know if I'm just being sensitive, but this really bothers me.;;;So my ADHD boyfriend started traveling for work recently. Whenever I wake up for work I shoot him a good morning text not expecting a reply back. Grab my coffee, turn on the news and start scrolling through social media. And then I see it, he's online. Hour, hour and a half later I get a good morning text.   It bothers me, but I don't bring it up. That weekend, he comes home. Have a great weekend together and I casually bring it up.  He tells me that usually first thing in the morning, he likes to mindlessly swipe and that texting me back is just a little much for him in the am. Fair enough.  This week I notice he's starting doing it during the day as we text too. I'll get 2-3 FB tags from him, but no reply to a text about something important. Then he calls hours later without replying like it's business as usual.  I'm trying not to be upset about this but it's hard knowing he's  actively seeing and ignoring my texts. What upsets me just as much are the lies. Oh, sorry. I just got off work and the first thing I did was call you. I want to say, no you didn't, the first thing you did was scroll through FB like and share a bunch of stuff and now you're finally getting around to calling me.  Can someone show me another point of view, explain his or agree with my feelings?
