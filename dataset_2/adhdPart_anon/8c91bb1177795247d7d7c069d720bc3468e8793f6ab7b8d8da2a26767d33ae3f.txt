Ive been reading alot about ADD and im pretty sure he has it. Even he thinks so..  Now my question is. Can you please share your experiences on living with an ADD partner?  I'm a very emotional and talkative person. My boyfriend is the opposite. And next to that i miss something in our relationship but I do love him alot.   I think it has to do with not showing alot of interest. Me organizing everything literally and reminding him of everything. He is lazy.. and if he heard me lol.. he takes forever to reply.
