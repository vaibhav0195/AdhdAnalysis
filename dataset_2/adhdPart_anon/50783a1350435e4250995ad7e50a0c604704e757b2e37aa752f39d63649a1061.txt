We have started strongly suspecting my spouse suffers from adhd (undiagnosed at this point), and tbh I’m not sure where to start/what to say, but i need support.   Reading any articles discussing adult adhd or relationships with adults with adhd feels like a direct mirror of my entire relationship timeline (9 years!). Ive discussed it with my spouse (he brought it up actually) and he is open but he hasn’t taken any steps towards finding a diagnosis or seeking out support.    I am so exhausted from dealing with it all, and i am so sick of nagging him to get things done with little to no results, but something needs to give here. Especially with covid, it feels like the issues are even more apparent and we are just continually bringing out the worst in each other. Im so tired of it all. Does anyone have any advice for someone who is starting out on this journey?
