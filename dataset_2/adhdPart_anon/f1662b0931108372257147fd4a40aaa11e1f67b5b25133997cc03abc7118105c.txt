Can't talk to him about any of it without him getting defensive angry and shutting it down with excuses. If he actually cared about his kids wouldn't he take time to play with them? And I mean genuine. Not 5-10 mins once in a blue moon while impatient to get back to his phone within that short amount of time. And then uses those few mins to look back on to be able to say "but I did play with them".   Simple things that don't even cost money would be romantic for me. Pack a picnic. Pick a flower. Look into my eyes, hold my hand, give me some kind of worth. Light a candle and run a bath. Set aside some time to have a genuine conversation without your phone (but you know I can multitask is the only answer apparently) Past several anniversaries I've received nothing, not even his time. Because to him a real date would cost loads of money and seeing as we don't have much $$ I get absolutely nothing. When all I want is his attention. His love. I want genuine compassion. A loving father and husband that makes us feel worth his time.  But he's always too busy. In his phone. Arguing with people online or whatever else he can wrap his mind around. Anything but us. Reality. It's too boring for him. He's said that.  Like, it's way too big of a task for him and I can't say anything or I'm the bad guy. There's no trying. It's a bunch of selfish replies.  He says "he doesn't care" a lot. "What do you want from me?"  I NEED YOU TO CARE.
