Advice wanted!;;;My  significant other (of over 3 years)  has been dx since early childhood, and so is his immediate family (parents and sibling). My biggest issue is anytime we make progress in working on communicating and fixing behaviors that his family had instilled in (such as only eating fast food, not doing things such as taxes, paying bills, always missing deadlines, no dates), S.O talks to his mom who convinces him I'm not being understanding.  My guy also has a depression diagnosis, and has been going through it bad. His mom is encouraging him to stay in bed, eat fast food, play video games, etc instead of helping with chores and the tasks he's already behind on. I feel beyond my limit and questioning if it's worth the uphill battle.  I could use any advice dealing with encouraging chores without feeling like I have to mother him or bully him into it!
