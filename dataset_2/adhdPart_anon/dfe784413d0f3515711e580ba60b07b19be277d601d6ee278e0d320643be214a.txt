He was always quiet before we moved in/got married and I think bc I now spend every day with him I notice it a lot more. When he gets this quiet I get nervous that I did something wrong, I also struggle with anxiety, so I instantly jump to the conclusion that he wants to break up and that he doesn’t love me anymore. He tells me he loves me and I know he does but sometimes my mind will go all over the place and I will ignore all the good he’s telling me and focus on every little bad thing he says.  Yesterday was really good for him he was happy, we went shopping and he was being interactive, but today when he woke up he went straight to the computer. He didn’t want to go outside, didn’t want to go to the store, didn’t want to eat let alone look at me. It breaks my heart to see him like this but I try and tell myself that this is not because I did something wrong and I know I need to give him space when he gets to this place.  I sometimes feel like I’m going crazy thinking about all of this constantly, but I love him and want to spend the rest of my life with him and I’d rather gain more information on how to help him instead of push him away bc I don’t have any knowledge of what he is going through.
