a5e51a43af91dedcae0d2440cb6c05010d387990985ed1c23a8158fd683385f0;;;Seeking the appropriate community;;;I’ve read through some posts in this community and I would agree that my wife’s behavior reflects a lot of the ADHD behavior discussed, but she is not diagnosed. I love my wife and we make things work most of the time, but every now and then I need a place to unload.  I am not necessarily looking for advice. My wife and I can generally resolve our differences and we make progress little by little. But there are times when it takes me a while to calm down and there’s not a lot of value in reading her the riot act again and again about disorganization, missed appointments, lack of structure and routine, etc.   I’ll stop there because I know this is not the rant thread. I just don’t know if the ADHD partners rant thread is the right place for me since my partner is not diagnosed and has no interest in being diagnosed.  I made a similar post in the r/relationships community and it was removed when I asked for people to stop giving relationship advice. My wife knows what my concerns are and she doesn’t need the ranting. Would anyone know of another community that might be more appropriate for my needs?
