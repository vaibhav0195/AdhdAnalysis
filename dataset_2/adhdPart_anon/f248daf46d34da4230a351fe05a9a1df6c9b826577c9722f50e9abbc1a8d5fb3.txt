He refuses to take breaks while he's working because he "needs it to even function" (it's true, it's just hurtful that he acknowledges how big of a difference it makes and chooses to give work the functional version of himself while his family gets what he calls "the absent-minded professor").  I'm unhappy with this state of affairs and want a functioning partner. I've let him know how I feel about it, but before I further dig in on my position, I want to know if taking breaks is actually good or necessary or whether it helps make the "on" days better.  Anyone got knowledge, experience, or research on this?
