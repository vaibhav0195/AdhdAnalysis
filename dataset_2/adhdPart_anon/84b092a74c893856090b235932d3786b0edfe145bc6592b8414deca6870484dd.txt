Let me know if I need to make a change, mods)  routinely just... doesn't come home from work. For periods of 2-6 hours at a time.   Doesn't text or call (which I've asked for several times, in varying degrees of calm, and which is really important to me as I'm managing anxiety over here. Six hours of radio silence is six hours of my brain going "ooooh, what if they DIED") and when he finally shows up with the car we share, which I might have needed:   Oh, someone needed a ride. I had to wait with someone while they waited for AAA. Work ran late. It was just a couple drinks. Just catching up with a friend. Just a quick game of pool. Gave someone a ride and they had to make a stop and and and.   And meanwhile the chores pile up here, I can't go anywhere myself, we're on a budget so it's really not fair for me to jaunt off in an Uber and have my own party time, and I feel hurt, too. I come home from work excited to see him and get a hug and just be with my person who I love. It feels a lot like I'm the last resort and the thing he HAS to come home to when the fun winds down.  It's so painful and trying to express it just gets excuses or a fight if/when I eventually break my calm and cry out of frustration and abandonment.    Is there anything to do? Another way to ask? Am I being unreasonable to ask for heads up or an ETA? Anyone else just struggling with this?
