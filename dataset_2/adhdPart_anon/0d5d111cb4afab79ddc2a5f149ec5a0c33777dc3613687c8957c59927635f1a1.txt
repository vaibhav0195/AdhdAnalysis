He was diagnosed with Adhd in his early twenties and is on medication for it. We have both had a very tough year (nothing to do with our relationship but other things impacting us) and he is now a full blown alcoholic. He would generally drink beforehand everyday, maybe 3 or 4 drinks. But now it's like 15 everyday (if not more!!).   My savings are gone. But I'm too afraid to cut him off because I have seen what he's like without it. The shakes, vomiting etc. I just want to get the ball rolling for his recovery but I have no idea how. He went and saw his doctor and he recommended rehab for which my partner immediately shot down but has since opened up to the idea. I don't want to watch him kill himself and I'm so afraid to lose him.   He feels sick all the time and I'm convinced it's the alcohol. How do you go about this? Does he go back to his doctor and get a referral? I'm sure you guys know how hard it is to even get them to the doctor. I'm so stressed I feel like I'm going to pull my hair out! We tried getting him to cut down by limiting his drinks, obviously didn't work. If you've been in a similar situation before, please give me some advice on what to do. I would really, really appreciate it. Thank you so much for listening to me.
