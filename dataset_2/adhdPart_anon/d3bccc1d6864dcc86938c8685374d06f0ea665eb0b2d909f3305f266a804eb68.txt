d3bccc1d6864dcc86938c8685374d06f0ea665eb0b2d909f3305f266a804eb68;;;Reading the Responses in this Sub Are Pretty Depressing;;;I'm a 22 y/o college graduate been in one serious relationship through half of high school going into half of college - reading everything here makes me feel like it was all my fault honestly... I wasn't diagnosed until my last semester of college along with some other stuff to add the cherry on top which all then made sense to me.   a lot of the complaints I'm seeing here are stuff I feel like I could have improved on but I also feel like I wasn't doing HORRIBLY but now I don't really know. Sucks to see a lot of us ruin other people's lives in one way or another. Its kinda disheartening to see that some people will completely not get involved with someone with adhd but I get it at the same time. Sorry :(
