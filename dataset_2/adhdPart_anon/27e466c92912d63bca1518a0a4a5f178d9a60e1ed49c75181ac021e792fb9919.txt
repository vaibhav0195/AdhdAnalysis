During the 2yrs he wasn't aware ADD was why he was having certain behaviors and I wasn't either until about three months ago when he was re-diagnosed as an adult. So I need him to understand what dealing with that for 2yrs did to me and why it's now hard for me to just move forward as he gets help. Is there any phrasing that y'all found particularly helpful? or a certain way to explain stuff? I feel like he doesn't understand how bad he was during these 2yrs (though he's tried to) and so I just need a way for him to have more perspective.

We’ve been together almost 3 yrs and I have been doing a lot of work on my own to try to fix how I see him. And of course him getting treatment has helped since he was undiagnosed and untreated for the first like two years. But due to him of course still having behaviors (some that can definitely be worked on too) etc I still see him as a child and have trouble being attracted to him sexually, though of course like objectively I still find his looks attractive. I know a lot of couples are in this position and I’m wondering if anyone has any tips to kind of get myself out of viewing him that way and get back to having a healthy sex life.
