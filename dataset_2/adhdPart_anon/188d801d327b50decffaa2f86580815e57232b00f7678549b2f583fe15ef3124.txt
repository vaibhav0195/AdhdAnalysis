It's almost as if, if I don't text, he doesn't remember that I exist. Like I don't ask for much but it's so frustrating especially when you're not going to get to see each other. He doesn't forget his other hobby that he's hyperfocused on, but not the girl he is in love with.  I guess I just wanna know if you guys have had similar experiences too and if you have any advice on how to solve it. Or maybe I just needed to rant to people who actually know what it's like.

And it's just been over a year of  being together (we're both 25, he's diagnosed and medicated). I like to think I have extraordinary levels of patience and he acknowledges it too but sometimes I wanna bang my head into a brick wall with the things he does sometimes. I'm so exhausted with being understanding and filling in the blanks all the time with no help. And I'm tired of constantly having to have talks with him because it's starting to sound like nagging to me. Those who have been doing this for years, please tell me how you do it. I could really use some advice and support. I love this man but if I don't find a way to deal with this, I don't know how much longer I can do this.
