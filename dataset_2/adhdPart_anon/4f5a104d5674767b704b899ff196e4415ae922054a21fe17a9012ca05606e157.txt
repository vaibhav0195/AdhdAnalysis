4f5a104d5674767b704b899ff196e4415ae922054a21fe17a9012ca05606e157;;;Dx SO refuses to get treatment/help;;;I’m so exhausted. My son turned 8m today and I completely lost it during one of his tantrums because I’m so done being responsible for him AND his father.   The only thing I ever ask SO to do is to do the dishes and don’t throw his clothes around. Well, he just leaves his clothes where he took it off, leaving it for me to pick it up, and he takes one hour to wash three glasses and a few plates. Then he says he’s exhausted because “he does so much in the house after work”. Now he started to leave the bloody masks (the ones we use to help avoiding the disease that put us into lockdown!!!!) wherever he took it off, like the clothes. When I confront him about it all he just says it’s the ADHD and he can’t change who he is. Whenever I tell him I’m tired he makes it about him. Everything is about him.   I’m literally on my last string here because he blames EVERYTHING on ADHD (even when he cheated) and yet he refuses to get medication/treatment because he said he took it when he was 14 and it made him lethargic. But damn it’s been more than 15 years!! Treatments improved, there’s different medicines.  I don’t know what to do anymore. I seriously need advice or someone to talk to.
