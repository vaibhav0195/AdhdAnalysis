26602bc4e93a4787d1dafb26e782579dcf1bd510be8c9e9ccbca87a06e570b75;;;My DX bf started meds again this week;;;I've never seen him on meds, really. He took them once or twice in the beginning when he was finishing high school by doing a semester's worth of work in a week, but it's mostly been three years of hell. His cumulative GPA, age 22, after a year and a summer of classes, is 1.5. Struggled to keep a job. Struggled to have important conversations because he'd forget what he had said literally two messages before. Struggled to keep friends, in person and online.  &amp;#x200B;  I don't know how I let it get so bad. I don't know why I stayed. But yesterday, we had our first truly coherent phone call. He's on 18mg concerta - four years ago, he was on 100mg. He went to a restaurant and was horrified by how he could 'hear' all the noises -- \*and himself\*. Classes start this week, and for once, I'm actually optimistic that something changed.   &amp;#x200B;  The next few weeks are still make-or-break. I'm not 100% certain. But I can see a future with him again for the first time in I don't know how long. Things might be okay.
