He was diagnosed with ADHD and depression around 2 years ago.  He’s never been particularly close with my family, as they don’t really have a lot in common, but they used to get along just fine.  But lately it’s become obvious (to me) that they don’t like him or support our relationship anymore. They haven’t outright said it, but I get the feeling they just wish we would divorce.  My husband is really struggling right now.  He’s very depressed.  As a result, I’m really struggling.  We have all the classic problems I read about here - chronic under employment, unfair balance of household chores, hyper focusing on random hobbies. You all know what it’s like.   My other sisters are both married, and my parents favouritism to my other brother-in-laws is so obvious.  They’re friendlier, happy to see them, etc.  They’re very cold to my husband.  My husband is not very helpful when we are hanging out with my family (I know this is a problem, and it’s one I’ve spoken to him about many times), but my mom has started making snide and rude comments.  My sister has even “jokingly” called him useless.    It’s hurting my feelings so much.  I’m normally quite close to one of my sisters and my mom, but I feel like I can’t talk to them about my problems anymore.  Anybody else in a similar situation?
