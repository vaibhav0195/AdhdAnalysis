My S.O has recently been diagnosed with ADHD (about 4 months ago) and has tried two medications without too much success. They have decided to stop taking their medication at random without discussing with their doctor and don't tell me until days later and are about to give up on trying more stimulants. I understand it is a confronting process and they are annoyed that the first two haven't worked however I know it takes time to find they right fit. I often struggle with their impulsive behaviour or mood swings however this time I just feel a bit like I'm drowning or constantly talking them off a cliff. We have come so far seeing a psych and trying medication and I was so relieved to have them seeing someone and they were looking forward to trying a medication that works. My S.O has been talking about all the things they could do if the stimulant made them feel how the people on the internet say they now feel. I am just at such a loss as to why they would just throw that all away and stop trying. I am scared of them stopping medication (with who knows what side effects) and then not getting help and the pressure that will then fall on me. I know it isn't about me but I feel so powerless and overwhelmed by them wanting to throw this whole process away. Has anyone else been through times like this? I could really use some advice,  I have no idea where to go from here.
