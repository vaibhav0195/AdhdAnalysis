f1117bd96b32e3ae2e45d2596eccdeeb55a797b677baa8605a9c670ae326a684;;;Communication...or the lack thereof;;;I didn’t get to see what a “normal, healthy marriage” was growing up because I grew up in a dysfunctional household. I’m pretty sure my dad was NDX. Absolutely textbook ADHD marriage except my dad had excellent control of his emotions- he would just leave when she called him out on his behaviors.   We’ve been together for nearly two decades and we hardly speak. He’s NDX and stubborn. A few details about bills or “did you feed the dog”, “look at this meme”, etc. He doesn’t see anything wrong with coexisting in the same house like this. No romance, no deep conversations. No meals together. I’m done trying because all he does is the polite “yeah” “Uhm hmm” like he’s pretending to listen. Like you do with the talkative coworker that corners you at the water cooler. On good days we can bond over work annoyances. If I bring anything up to fix this situation, it’s RSD time. What’s the point? Is this what long term marriage is? How many of you guys are the couple that sit in a restaurant sharing a meal without speaking? I mean I know life isn’t a Hallmark movie but Jeez.
