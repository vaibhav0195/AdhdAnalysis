I'll ask about why his ADHD seemingly became severe out of nowhere. He has no answer. Anytime we talk about deep topics, he has a difficult time answering and often withdraws. I'm trying to be patient but I'm not sure how to get answers from him without him feeling overwhelmed.   Any non-ADHD partner have any success?
