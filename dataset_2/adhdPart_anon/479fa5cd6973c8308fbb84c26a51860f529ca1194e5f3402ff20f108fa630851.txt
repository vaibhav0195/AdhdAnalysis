She's very open about her ADHD, and it really hasn't been a problem since we began talking.  Basically, she seems like she really has her life together and that her life is going places. She's in grad school and is applying to higher level programs for next year. She's involved with and committed to her work, probably one of the smartest people I've ever met. Her house is clean, she's OK with money, etc. I say all of this because she's openly talked about her struggles with me; she says her symptoms are actually pretty serious in her mind even though she tangibly is able to cope with those symptoms. She says this is because she was re-diagnosed/medicated as an adult and spent most of her life coming up with tools to deal with the ADHD.   When you look up what it's like to date someone with ADHD, you see a lot of horror stories about having to parent your SO, them getting disinterested, etc. I guess what I'm looking to know is what it's really like dating someone with ADHD; what does it mean that she copes with the physical consequences of her symptoms but still struggles a lot internally with them?
