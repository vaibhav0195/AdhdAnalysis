b57c8103b299c1c2b7b4a4c2d3f69d000f522353e57956818e67dd274e1008cd;;;Can't ask partner to get anything while at the store;;;I've been reading so many posts here and it's helped me in many ways - sometimes made me feel like it could be worse, sometimes made me feel less alone in this and other times just made me laugh...because laughing is better than crying about some of these crazy-making things.  So here's my vent, and it's a tiny one! But so frustrating! When my ADHD spouse goes to the store, I can't text him to ask him to get something I think of that I know we need there. It leads to overwhelm. This drives me crazy. I hate inefficiency. End of vent. :)
