But she'll have a problem and let it fester sometimes for months and then suddenly tell me one day in the worst most dramatic way possible then immediately take it back and say she never meant it. Example: we had an in joke about her being a drama queen, I never ever said it in a derogatory way and it was always in a jokey way like if she was lying in a dramatic pose, and she'd play up to it. One day in an argument she said she fucking hates it and always has and made it seem like I'd been abusing her. She immediately took it back. I don't joke with her any more.
