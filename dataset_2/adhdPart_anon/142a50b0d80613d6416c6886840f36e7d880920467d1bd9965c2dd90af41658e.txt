Medication has helped her a lot in so many areas but she still struggles with situations where she feels like someone is blaming her. This happens between us and she shuts down completely or lashes out when she feels like I think she did something wrong or bad.  My wife is the breadwinner and she has an incredible business job working at a corporation. I used to work in the same line of work but quit to go into social work. I'm currently in grad school and we rely completely on her income. Sometimes in work situations, she will get so upset and frustrated with her boss or coworkers because they want her to fix/update a report she worked on. She gets obsessed with trying to prove she is right and will send all day ruminating on it vs. just fixing the issue. She will come to me to vent and it always makes me panicked bc I worry she will damage her work relationships or reputation by not responding well to feedback or suggestions. This causes me a lot of distress and I want to help her navigate these situations better but nothing I say seems to help her.  Can anyone relate? Any advice for me on how to not panic in these situations? Or, does anyone have any suggestions on how to let go as the non-adhd partner when you see things like this happening?  Appreciate you all so much!
