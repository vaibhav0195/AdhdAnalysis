21bf7ff12aa435abe03bed791777a8a63cb7bc4679faefbc7047573f0063d086;;;Please advice;;;Hello  I am 49, father of 4, been married for 22 years. I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety early this year and a few months later with ADD. I am both on medication to treat the depression/anxiety and on medication to help me cope with my ADD. I went to see my doctor as my wife draw a line in the sand. It was either that or divorce. I did not feel that there was anything wrong with me, but after talking to my doctor, the depression and the anxiety were diagnosed. And with visiting my therapist, the ADD was diagnosed. The meds and therapy have opened my eyes to my symptoms, and how my life has been ridden with the ADD and later caused me to develop depression/anxiety. I do understand that it will take me years of work to reach the level I want to be on, and hopefully to be the emotionally supportive husband my wife deserves, but I find the road to be both long and filled with fog.   I want to ask you, that is married to a spouse with ADD; What training, therapies, etc. did you see have the most positive impact on your family life and your relationship with your ADD partner?
