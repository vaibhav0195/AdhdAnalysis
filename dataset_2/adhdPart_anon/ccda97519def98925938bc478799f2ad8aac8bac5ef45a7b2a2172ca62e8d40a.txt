ccda97519def98925938bc478799f2ad8aac8bac5ef45a7b2a2172ca62e8d40a;;;No intimacy after Dx;;;5 years together. So recently we found out that my partner has ADHD and I don’t know why but I have so much resentment about this when he was super happy and relieved. For years it’s been like a battle on my end but I guess for him he’s just happy he has answers about all his behaviors. The behaviors I had to put up with for 5 years thinking I was the one that was worthless. So now, I’m finding it hard to be intimate with him because I’m so mad/sad and sometimes I feel like it’s not worth it anymore if this is gonna be a life long thing. Is this normal and will my resentment ever go away?
