b2e8954694f4f785b217c6520cec5470c7ad6213a70c9208f3d5a6c61e0e6770;;;It's my 30th birthday this week and I've just been told my partner has spent all the money to go out for it :);;;Give me strength. Sorry I was selfish one time and thought we could spend some money on me for once and have fun. I'm not at all bothered about the money it's more the absolute zero lack of effort and telling me about it 3 days before so I will have to take a loan for my own birthday.  He has absolutely no concept of what it means to turn 30. Then he gets defensive and mad at me because I bought one set of cushions for our new house for 50 euros. I have been unable to work as I am a singer so haven't been making money for 3 months bar money from selling on Ebay and a tiny amount from the government. Am I being an asshole here for wanting him to make an effort for me for once?
