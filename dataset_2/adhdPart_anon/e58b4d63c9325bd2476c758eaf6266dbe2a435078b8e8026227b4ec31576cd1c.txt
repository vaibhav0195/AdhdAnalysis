He’s often the opposite, forgetting assignments or turning things in at the deadline and therefore unable to do other fun things besides school work. (We’re both in college) Most of our dates end up being studying late at night just so we can spend time together. Sundays we always cook dinner together and that’s been a great routine for us.   So my question is, how do I balance encouraging him to make decisions or do hw earlier and giving him extra time and just being patient.  Or- are there other ways I can be more supportive? We’ve both been wanting to have more set dates during the day instead of just falling asleep on the couch lol   So far, we balance each other out well but I’ve never dated someone with adhd and I want to be better for what he needs :)
