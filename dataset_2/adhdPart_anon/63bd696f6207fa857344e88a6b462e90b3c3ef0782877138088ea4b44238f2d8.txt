63bd696f6207fa857344e88a6b462e90b3c3ef0782877138088ea4b44238f2d8;;;My (21F) partners (22M)(DX unmedicated) drinking habits seem too relaxed;;;I understand with lockdown/quarantine that life is more dull and boring and my partner is struggling the most with this. His hobby is the gym, more specifically lifting weights which he can't mimic at home, so we've been sat mostly watching TV, playing video games and at the weekend - having a drink.  We used to go out most weekends to the pub and then clubbing so we drink fairly regularly outside of quarantine. I think in these situations it's acceptable to drink a fair amount and feel drunk...but not doing the same thing at home each weekend.  Every weekend he's gotten more excited to drink and seems to want to more often. I'm tired of it and want a weekend off. He also says things like 'I'm going to have a break this weekend' but then the suns out, he's having a good day and decides to have one, two, three, four.  He doesn't drink to be tipsy, he drinks to get drunk and that's my issue. It doesn't feel relaxed enough for me at any time that we've had a drink. He also likes to have a joint before bed and struggles to relax enough to sleep without it (ADHD brain).   We've spoken about it and he's tried to reassure me that it's because he's bored and it's just a nice thing to do at the weekends but I fail to see how it's not healthy.   Do you guys have any tips on how to approach this differently as I think he seems to feel I'm boring and not letting loose but on the flip side, I feel like he's too loose?  Am I being too uptight? I just feel like we want different things and my ideas are more mature, possibly.
