Hope this is the right place to post :)   &amp;#x200B;  TLDR at the end :)  ***Relationship dynamics***   My best friend has ADHD; lives in Japan. I am Austrian. We've become really close during my stay in Japan and due to the pandemic and our work/university circumstance remain in close contact via Skype. Maybe we've spent too much time together lately.  ***The general problem: I cannot rely on an agreement or time commitment that was made***   Most of the times we agree to something at a specific time, it ends up being later. Sometimes I get a heads up, sometimes not. Sometimes I get a repetition of "wait 15 more minutes" a few times. This basically keeps me in an indefinite waiting loop until she is done with what she's doing. It makes me anxious and prevents me from doing other things.  ***An example - Yesterday's fight***   We both agreed to watch a movie in 30 minutes. After those 30 minutes it was a constant "I'm sorry, just wait a liiittle bit longer" until 90 minutes have passed in total. I was not doing anything during the last 60 minutes, because it was always "just wait a bit, I'm done soon". After those 90 minutes I was quite annoyed and told her. The last thing in those 90 minutes was a work email she had to reply to. Now, because she thinks breaking the agreement was "out of her control", I should not blame her. Summary of her words: "It's nothing I can control, so why are you blaming me for unavoidable things? Why are you not accpeting my valid reason (--&gt; had to send a work email; that was only 10 of 60 minutes)??? You disrespect me by disregarding my reason. Why am I always the only one being blamed? You are late too, so why do you always blame me?" I try to be understanding. I am trying to actively take responsibility for my part, try to understand her view without blindly agreeing to things I don't think are true. I am only met with blame and disregard. Didn't get even a "sorry"...   ***\*\*\*First question: How do I NOT blame her when calling out HER mistake. Telling her what part of her behaviour I didn't like is basically blaming her, right? Did I understand something wrong? How do I not blame someone if I think at least part of the problem is their fault?\*\*\****   I already admitted the parts that I didn't really do well and apologised for them, I decided to improve them --&gt; should've chosen my words more carefully, friendlier tone, should've stated expectations precisely and communicate more directly. (It is also partly my fault because I try to be understanding, so I've let is slip very often. It's probably not called being understanding, but being enabling.... I haven't told her this)  ***\*\*\*Second question: What strategies can I use to not have problems like this happend again? I feel like this is quite a big problem that might cause great harm to this friendship...\*\*\****   Being in the constant waiting loop stressed me out, makes me anxious and annoyed. It wastes my time. This in turn makes me angry at her, which then slowly degrades the friendship....  TLDR  My long distance best friend's (lol that sounds funny) ADHD causes her to break many commitments we make e.g. watch a movie at 3. It feels like I am kept in the indefinite waiting loop until she is done with all the "just 10 more minutes" things. I feel anxious and and like my time is wasted. This sometimes leads to big fights. Could you give me any advice or strategies of things I can do so these things happen less often. I'd be sad if the friendship ends. I am trying to be understanding, but in turn I become enabling, I think... I am not good with boundaries, what is acceptable or not etc...  ***I am thankful for any practical adivce, actionable startegies, hints or just kind words***  ***Thank you so much!***
