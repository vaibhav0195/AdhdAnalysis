I’ve been together with my husband since I was 19. I’m 27 now, married in 2012. I got married at 20/21 actualy because I was pregnant, but also we had a good loving relationship and we seemed to work together on our problems pretty well. I always feel the need to disclaim that...  Anyways, marriage is so hard, and sometimes I run out of optimism and I feel like I need a lot of help. Our main problems are this mom-child relationship, him being overreactive and sensitive. We’ve been through marriage counseling from march 2017-july2017 which ultimately ended in him wanting a divorce. After a few days he took it back and we upended our lives to make big changes. This is actually when I learned that ALL of our problems were the cause of an ADHD relationship.   After all these years of therapy, NO ONE pointed out the adhd! He was diagnosed as a kid, he’s been untreated but I didn’t know how big of a deal it was. I always thought it was just “the inability to focus” and it turns out theres emotions, processing issues... almost endless.  Anyways theres so much information and I don’t know anyone going through my hardships. I am trying so hard to do my part in our relationship to be patient, loving, respectful, and conscious of consequences, but every time we have some sort of conflict I feel like I’m talking myself off a ledge of despair. We have a kindergartener and a 1.5 yr old baby.  Please! Comment and chat with me. I need so much to interact with others that can help me stay positive.
