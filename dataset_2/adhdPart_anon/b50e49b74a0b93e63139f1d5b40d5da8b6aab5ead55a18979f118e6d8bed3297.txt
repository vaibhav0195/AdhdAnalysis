How long is it acceptable to “wait” or is the relationship over?;;;My boyfriend (been together 3 months, friends for 8)  lost one of his family members. Ever since then, he hasn’t contacted me. He also has depression. I’ve tried texting him three times with no response over the period of 1.5 weeks, and then I finally sent a text recently saying I was here for him if/when he wanted to talk and that I cared about him, but I wasn’t contacting him anymore so he has space.   We haven’t seen each other for three weeks now, and haven’t properly talked in a month (mainly because we haven’t seen each other in person). Everything was totally fine between us before his family member passed away. I know he is grieving and I am trying to be sympathetic to that.   I guess what’s confusing me is that he never asked for space, hasn’t broken up with me, there’s just... no responses.   He’s done this to me before when he was having a depressive episode, but it only lasted a week but he let me know that he needed space. Now there’s nothing for me to go off of.  Did I handle it the right way?
