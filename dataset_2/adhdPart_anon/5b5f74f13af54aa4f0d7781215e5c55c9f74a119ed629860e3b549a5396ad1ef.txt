Is this an adhd thing?;;;When he is struggling and is short or cold or snaps or just doesn't respond to what I'm saying enthusiastically, I don't say a word. I always let him be grumpy because usually it passes.   90% of the time i am grumpy and go quiet, suddenly I'm really "rude" and he goes quiet in response, and when I come out of my funk, he stays in his. I've takes it personally. Instead of just standing by my side while I ride the wave he makes it into a thing.   He has had a fucked life. So much abandonment and death in his family. I'm all he has. Sometimes I wonder if maybe its that? Every other orphans I've been close too has been a rocky journey because they have such high expectations of me. Especially if I'm their only support network.  Could this be that? Is it ptsd and fear of abandonment? Or is this common with adhd?   I know he cares deep down, but its like in the moment he cant socially grasp what I need when I'm upset or grumpy.   If I'm grumpy and I snap a tiny bit, they just back off and give me a second, or just hand me a cup of tea. Usually I come back and say sorry for snapping and they get it. We move on.   I wish my partner could do this for me. I feel like I have to stay strong for the both of us.  I'm always the one that initiates affection after a fight. Even if its a fight about something he has done to me. I always end up comforting him.
