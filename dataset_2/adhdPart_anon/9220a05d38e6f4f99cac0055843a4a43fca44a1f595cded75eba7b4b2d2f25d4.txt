My SO was diagnosed with depression, anxiety and ADD all Around the time, he is on medication to help with his depression/anxiety and than another one for his ADD. He struggles a lot at night to sleep he can’t ever shut his brain off and when his ADD medication wears off he feels really anxious. He resorted to getting un prescribed Xanax from his friend and he’s taken to much before and it worries me.  My question is does anyone know how I can help him or if anyone knows any techniques or what he can do to shut his mind off and help him sleep.
