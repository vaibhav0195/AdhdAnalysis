I believe that my partner (medicated) is done hyperfocusing on me now and there's someone else in the picture. She said there isn't but I'm not inexperienced. She no longer looks at me or treats me the same way she did before. She's also no longer interested in settling down, having kids or being intimate with me.  On top of that, she's been quite depressed lately. She said it's due to a recent trauma, but I suspect it's not just that but also related to being stuck in this relationship. I think she's only staying because she doesn't want to hurt me. I'm trying everything I can to save this relationship and she is also seeking professional help, but honestly I wouldn't be surprised if this relationship ends.  I love her very much, and I'm not bitter. At this point I'm not worried about whether we last as a couple or not. She will always be family to me. As much as this sucks and hurts, I just want her to get better. I hope, but don't think she can be happy staying with me. However, I also know that her executive dysfunction won't allow her to take good care of herself if she's by herself. And even the she's with someone else, she'll likely just go through the same cycle.  I'm thinking of reaching out to her family to see if they can help, but I'm also wondering if this community can suggest something.  Thanks in advance  On the plus side, this experience has taught me what love is and how to love better.
