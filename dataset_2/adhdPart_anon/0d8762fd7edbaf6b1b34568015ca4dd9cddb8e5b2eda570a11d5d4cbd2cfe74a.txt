I always thought his behaviour was just him...  We are falling into the typical roles - I’m angry as it feels like I all do all the heavy lifting at home (I do) and he thinks I nag (I do) - typical.   Anyway, I’m very interested to hear from how anyone has managed to move past the angry stage and be more understanding and accepting.   I am trying - and failing - to understand that his brain is hardwired differently to mine, so any advice on moving forward would be great as I hate the person I’ve become - angry and resentful
