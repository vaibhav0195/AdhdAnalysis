It may not show up when you view the sub with the old Reddit theme (thanks Reddit!), so if you don't see it, try going to [https://new.reddit.com/r/ADHD\_partners](https://new.reddit.com/r/ADHD_partners). * We have enabled post flair! We're starting with a few general flairs, as Reddit only allows a single flair per post. You should be able to flair your own posts, at least on desktop. If you leave your post without flair, mods might try to flair it for you. The goal of using flairs is to make it easier to search for posts of a certain type. * You may notice that there is no rant/vent post flair. This is intentional, as we're planning an experiment of consolidating rant/vent content into weekly threads instead of individual posts. Expect weekly threads to start showing up some time later this week, depending on when we manage to persuade Automod to do our bidding. * User flairs are available, too. There's a "community options" dropdown in the sidebar where you can select and edit your user flair. Use your user flair to tell others what they might want to know when they see your posts and comments. Please start with the DX (self or partner is diagnosed with ADHD), NDX (not diagnosed), or Other flair and edit it to contain the information you want. * The Wiki is visible ([https://new.reddit.com/r/adhd\_partners/wiki/index](https://new.reddit.com/r/adhd_partners/wiki/index)). It's currently just a pile of resources and some acronyms, but we hope to build it out over time. If you have science or articles you'd like to nominate for inclusion in the wiki, please post them with the science/articles flair.  Please let us know what you think of these changes by commenting below.
