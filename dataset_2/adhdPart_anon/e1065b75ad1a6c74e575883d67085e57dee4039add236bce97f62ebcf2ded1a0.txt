e1065b75ad1a6c74e575883d67085e57dee4039add236bce97f62ebcf2ded1a0;;;I feel like the worst girlfriend.;;;I've only just come across this sub. I have known my partner has ADHD since before we got together and although i always knew what it was, i never really looked into it in-depth. My partner had ADHD, ODD and at the lower end of the Autism spectrum. I have just been reading [this](https://www.additudemag.com/how-adhd-affects-relationships-add-spouse-perspective/) article and realised that a lot of our arguments probably are because of his autism. It was only a couple days ago i was telling him he clearly doesn't care about me because he always says he will do something and just doesn't. It was only last night i was telling him he has clearly gone off me because his sex drive and interest in me has plummeted this past week. Looking back on all of our arguments it seems has a lot to do with ADHD tendencies, something beyond his control and he has had to deal with the stress of me nagging at him and him not understanding why he is doing it wrong because i am his first proper relationship aswell. Yet most of the time he is the most amazing boyfriend and i know he is trying his best. I could cry i feel like such a shit girlfriend.
