4a42588449800d33d15ef46ca74f74027e34ec4c46954e1fe9bbe66730162e9d;;;There's nothing else I can do;;;When your severe adhd partner knows that there's such a deep problem with communication and basic living skills and cries and begs for you to not end it and promises it will change...it can't. Not for him. He knows there's a problem. He knows its destroying our marriage. He cries and pleads. I've sent him articles, online quizzes, discussed, screamed, cried, begged, made his appointments, got him on meds, do everything...washing, cooking, cleaning, paying the bills cause he can't remember, do all the shopping/appointments/taking him to and from work cause he can't drive (never has, doesn't try to learn at 32 y/o), pack his daily lunch, clean up his monstrous messes, finding everything he loses, remind him of important dates to file taxes, go to appointments, begged him to make daily to-do lists...and he can't mentally or physically put in the effort...I fucking can't. Married for almost 2 years. I can't take it anymore. Marriage is a team. It's 50/50. All the burden is on me and I can't leave. No job, no family, we have a 6 month old, no child care, car is fucking falling apart...I didn't sign up for this. My life and mental health has diminished. Omfg.
