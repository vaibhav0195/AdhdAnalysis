dcb2a1807cb8e2e103f0cc77da8ab12b62ea2acd7d1489d3fee0789e1894458d;;;How can I support my boyfriend?;;;I’ve been with my boyfriend for five years. When I met him he was in university, with a clear cut path in life. Over five years he’s dropped out, become very depressed, and cycled through about 20 different jobs.  He started a new job today and came home extremely depressed.  He finds it next to impossible to do a 9-5 job (and in his defence this job was hard labour for 13 hours a day) I told him to quit and I would support him while he found something else he could handle doing but he broke down crying because he feels like such a loser and a “constant disappointment” “dead weight”  I don’t know what to say to him. It is definitely frustrating at times, he goes months in between jobs or stays at a job where he’s completely miserable, crying every morning before work. I’ve always tried to be understanding of his adhd but it’s been four years of this and both of us are just exhausted at this point. He’s diagnosed but not on medication because we’re in Canada and it’s 2000 dollars just to get into the system which neither of us can afford right now especially when he’s not working.   Any advice? Anyone know jobs specifically good for people with adhd? We’ve looked into being a firefighter (not enough positions) and a cop (a lot of hoops to jump through which he doesn’t have the energy to work on yet, drivers license mostly). He definitely can’t handle anything with repetitive tasks which makes it hard. Thanks in advance.
