We were supposed to be going to a memorial service in another state next week for someone close to my partner. I had said I wanted to go to support him and to help him should he need someone to talk him down. We had talked bout plans for it initially weeks ago, but since then it kept being back burnered cause we didn't know if covid would force a cancellation. Last week, I opened up about how I felt very uneasy about going and like something awful was going to happen somehow. I really needed him to help me process what the issue could be. I was and am still incredibly frustrated that I can't figure out what part of this is making me so hesitant. We talked for hours and then that was it.  Last night, he goes to look for a rental car-can't find any at the rental place and within two minutes I'm accused of "forcing my way into the plan so I can sabotage it" and all sorts of other horrible things that aren't true at all. Not to mention his breaking stuff. Then five minutes later he walks it back and tells me he still wants me to go. Now I just keep on playing his words over and over.  This seems to be our pattern. He gets angry, says incredibly hurtful things, and wants forgiveness "cause he didn't mean it. He was just upset in the moment" I understand he has impulse control issues from the ADHD. How do I even trust though? Cause even if he doesn't mean it doesn't just the idea make it somewhat true?   Please any help, recommendations, books, etc anything would be appreciated....
