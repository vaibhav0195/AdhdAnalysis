This past weekend we had the same argument for the second time and it wasn’t until after the argument, which is about him forgetting dates/having poor time management and always being late...very late, that I realized it was the ADHD. To me being late to every time commitment with someone means you don’t care, and more than being late a few minutes being late a few hours or asking last minute all the time to bump something up a few hours is rude. I understand that it’s not his fault that he’s forgetful and has time blindness. But how do I not take it personally? Specifically the time blindness?
