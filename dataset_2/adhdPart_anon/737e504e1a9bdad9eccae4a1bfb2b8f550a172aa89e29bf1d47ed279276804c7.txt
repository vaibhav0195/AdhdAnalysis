737e504e1a9bdad9eccae4a1bfb2b8f550a172aa89e29bf1d47ed279276804c7;;;Do consequences matter?;;;My husband and 2 of my kids have ADHD and it is HARD needless to say. One problem that is bugging me is that they don't EVER seem to learn from their mistakes and improve, mainly bc they probably forget it ever happened? Whether it's the children that do something wrong and therefore have a consequence, or my husband constantly losing his stuff, but not preparing the day before so he isn't late for work when he's constantly looking for everything he's lost. These are just small examples, but I just feel like my teaching and helping is all in vein. They seem to never learn from any mistake/wrong doing, is my teaching pointless, or do I continue to try to help?   Also, I get so frustrated bc my husband is not good with the 2 ADHD kids. He is so annoyed with them and there (difficult) ways. He does not see he is just like them and a huge hypocrite in all his teachings to them, in every way.  When we are alone I try to kindly help him understand why the child may have reacted poorly to his discipline, or why the child may have done whatever he did in the first place, and at times show him how the exact same scenarios happen with him and I, but of course he just gets super defensive and upset and I have to drop it all. What do I do?   I'm so tired. I'm mentally/emotionally and physically exhausted from all 3 of them. I feel like I have to learn how to live my best life despite the facts, but I am having a hard time figuring out how to do that and manage everything in the family at the same time. Thanks for listening.
