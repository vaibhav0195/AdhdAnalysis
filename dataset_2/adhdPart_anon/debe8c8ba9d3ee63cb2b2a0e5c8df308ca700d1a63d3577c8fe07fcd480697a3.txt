debe8c8ba9d3ee63cb2b2a0e5c8df308ca700d1a63d3577c8fe07fcd480697a3;;;In need of books for understanding newly diagnosed wife/daughter;;;My wife (35F) and I (43M) have been having marital issues over the last several years and it has finally been coming to a head. I'm reading some books to work on my end of the issues with the marriage in general and we are going to seek counseling but she was recently diagnosed with ADHD. So I'm looking for a good book to help me understand any additional challenges we are/will face because of the ADHD. Also while researching my wife we also believe my 10 y/o daughter probably most likely has it. So my I'm looking for any good books to help me understand and over come the parenting issues we are having. Does anyone have any good general books to start with and something in particular for marital success and parenting.
