90c3eabd9b5fc87b89a49bd67f453e8f53a9d95d00f4760f3505ce2edfc18be8;;;2 kids and overwhelmed;;;First time posting  I am at the end of my rope. My husband has add along with a long trauma history. I am barely coping. I am a social worker and have a high stress job but it has good hours and great pay for the town we live in. We have 2 kids ages 2 and 4. My husbands add is in the moderate range but the things that were no big deal when we were first together have become harder and harder to deal with especially as my plate has gotten more and more full. Currently he has a job where he works almost exact opposite shifts from me and basically leaves me with the kids all weekend every weekend for the next 4 months. I told him at the start of this seasonal job that I was worried we wouldn’t survive another winter of this schedule. We are a month in and I feel like I am drowning. I also manage all of our finances and take care of anything to do with paperwork or planning etc. if I was by myself I could handle being a single parent and working, it feels like he literally makes my life harder constantly from little thing like piling dirty clothes all over the house or worse right beside the laundry basket to stacking empty cans and bottles on the kitchen window even though we have a recycling bin. To bigger things like letting the kids watch as much tv as they want because it means he can sleep on the couch or spending 100 a week on pot and vaping even though we cannot afford this. I guess I am feeling guilty because these were all issues at the start but I honestly felt like I could handle it and now it feels like I’m going back on that? I absolutely hate hate hate feeling alone in a relationship, and would rather just be alone. I’m not sure what I am looking for but needed to vent maybe.
