He wasn't the most handsome guy there but he kinda engulfed me with his attention. I can't remember ever having a conversation where i talked about farts, spaceships and methane fuel. He was my kind of funny.   We encountered eachother a few times with mutual friends and I couldn't get him out of my mind, and we started dating after that. I remember the first 6 months or so were amazing and i really fell for him. He always had a new place he wanted to visit, or tell me about something he read on the internet and had to find out all about it, like he was always at 120&amp;#37;.   He even wanted me to move in around the 5th month or so but I was still stuck with my own appartment. I think it was around then that he started to forget to text me back, and it started to happen more often. We'd still go do stuff together, but there was always some videogame and the rest had to wait. And it was me who had to suggest everything now.  I tried to bring it up, but i think it fell on deaf ears. Sometimes he'd just forget about the whole conversation, like it never happened. He once mentioned he probably has ADHD, but he's not medicated or something. He'd always sit on his phone while eating at the table and it's like he doesn't even hear me when i talk to him. I mean every relationship gets some routine, but this?  Can I do something to get that spark going again? I'd really like to get back that guy i met the first time, so plz help!
