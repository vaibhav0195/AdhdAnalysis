I’ve a relationship with a boy that suffer of ADHD. He’s been diagnosed by his father, a psychiatrist, when he was little. Now he is in his late 20s and ten years has passed from the last time he medicated. He has a phobia of medication and he won’t talk with his father anymore about it and he become mad when it happens.  My relationship is very complicated. There are times when I can’t ask anything to him, like help me with chores. We often fight about small things and he reacts like a baby.  To fight with him is very exhausting, he has outbursts of anger and usually scares me, and so I’m afraid of speaking about problem, because I don’t know how he could react.  For this mood swings he blames me of not letting him to concentrate with his studies, not leave him alone enough time.  Even if he waste so much time playing videogames, going out for a beer or a joint.  During fight it often ends with me or him ending the relationship, but soon after we come back togheter. I would like to convince him to start to medicate and let him feel and understand what I’m felling. Do you guys can help me in some way to get out and help me and him to get out of this loop? Thanks for everything
