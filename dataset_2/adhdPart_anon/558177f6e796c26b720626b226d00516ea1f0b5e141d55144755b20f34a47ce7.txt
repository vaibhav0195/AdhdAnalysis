I absolutely need to disclaim that my wife is my absolute best friend and I love her VERY much, and 90 percent of the time we are happy, laughing and having fun; both together and with our 1.5 year old daughter and our dog children. It's just that small percentage of times like today where I am just left confused, not knowing what to do next to make her happy with me again.  I struggle a lot with getting things done. I can improve for a bit and then fall back into old habits and it is a vicious (and frustrating) cycle. When I try to explain that something is happening because of my ADHD more than once a week, she thinks I am using it as an excuse. I'm not. This is legitimately how my brain works and I feel helpless.   Just the other day, we were talking about why a dish we make every week a little bit different, just in a casual conversation (she thought the same). I was like, "Why does it taste differently?"    Her: "I told you like last week, don't you remember?"   Me: "No... I don't. I'm sorry..."   Her: sounding frustrated "I literally told you like twice"   Me: "I'm really sorry, I just can't remember"  In this interaction, I felt like she was getting mad at me for something I cannot control and I felt very helpless, unknowing how to respond. When this happens, I try to justify WHY it happens, and it just makes her more impatient with me.  **Example 2:**     My wife is amazing and preps breakfasts for the week (eggs for each day). Last night she asked me if I wanted her to thaw some for today and I seriously thought I said "No." Thus, I was eating something else (PB Sandwich) when she walked into the kitchen...  Her: "Uhh.. What're you doing?"   Me: Unthinkingly just blurted a response with no context "It's Friday"   Her: "What do you mean it's Friday?"   Me: I had legitimately thought we talked about me eating something different one day of the week "I thought we said I could eat PB once in a while"   Her: "No, I don't remember talking about that"   Me: Another reason pops into my head "I just didn't feel like eggs"   Her: "Well that makes it even more confusing for me. How do I know how much to make you? See? This type of thing makes me feel underappreciated."   Me: "I do really appreciate you making breakfast every week and I'm sorry. Would it make you feel better if I said my didn't feel very well?" This was the absolute truth, but when I am receiving a barrage for some reason I just blurt answers that I think might help the situation.   Me: Trying to come to a resolution "I mean... I could just eat oatmeal every week, if that's easier for you. I wouldn't mind."   Her: "Then you need to let me know if I need to buy you oatmeal."   Me: "We have two full containers in the pantry, I was just going to use those."   Her: "But then I have to keep track of how much we have left because you won't tell me and then we won't have oatmeal for me to eat until it's too late".   Me: "Okay... I'm sorry!"   Her: Disingenuous "...it's okay..."   Me: "I love you!"   Her: "...love you too..."  I try to give her a hug as she leaves but she kinda shrugs me off. I sent her a text telling her that I was sorry and my not wanting eggs one day wasn't fair to her and she responded with "It's okay. I understand" and nothing else.   I know that when I get home everything will be fine, but I get so down on myself when this type of thing happens. Like I fucked up everything and can't do anything right. I have so much self-hate and want to be self-destructive (which normally means food). Apparently the term for this is Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria, but if I tell my wife, she'll probably rationalize it as a cop out and not owning my behavior.  **Another example:**   I grew up in a mentally abusive household (until I was 18). I was getting bullied at home by my Step Dad and then going to school and getting bullied there. I have a lot of confidence issues because of it and it definitely takes a toll on me at times.   My wife was listening to an audiobook "Unfuck Yourself" and tells me that I should try to let go of everything that has happened to me and not let it 'effect who I am now'. Basically, to leave the past in the past. For me... it's just not that simple. As much as I have worked through it, this will always be a part of me\\something that negatively impacts my thoughts and emotions.   She tells me I should really listen to the book, which I will, to give her the benefit of the doubt and who knows; maybe it will help. But dealing with these situations is incredibly taxing on me both mentally and physically.
