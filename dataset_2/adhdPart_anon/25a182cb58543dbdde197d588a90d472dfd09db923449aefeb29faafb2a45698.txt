25a182cb58543dbdde197d588a90d472dfd09db923449aefeb29faafb2a45698;;;Partner struggling with university work;;;My boyfriend was only diagnosed with adhd, as well as dyslexia, this summer and has started taking medication. He’s going into his third year doing a degree that he chose impulsively and hasn’t been interested in since beginning is second year. The past year has been a real struggle with him wanting to drop out, then changing his mind, and he now feels like he is stuck doing something he cares nothing about. He now has decided he wants to get a first in final year so that he has more options after uni but is putting so much pressure on himself and is getting so worked up over not being good enough and struggling to get anything done. He also suffers with depression so struggles with feeling confident in himself, often saying that without a degree he has nothing. I’ve tried to help him as much I can with plans, advise, and trying to look at the positive things but I feel like we’re just going round in circles with him melting down, me giving advise, him feeing better, and then the whole thing happening again.   Has anyone had a similar experience or have any advise on how to make it easier for him.   Thank you :)
