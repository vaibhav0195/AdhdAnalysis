d404762c51ac55b3a4579768af6fe1e73bb740c0dc4055304bf418ef3f3f7857;;;Hey guys I’m a 22M and I’m currently dating a 23F with ADHD;;;We’ve been dating since April and we are such a great match and I love her to bits but in the last 3 months when she has her emotional outbursts she turns to calling me names and gets real mean sometimes,  screams the house down even when I’m in bed because something was an inconvenience for her, I have been really patient and understanding as much as possible but I feel drained and I keep telling myself it’s just her ADHD, and she says the same. she says she can’t help it and that’s that... end of story. I want to keep trying but I can’t take anymore of the jealousy, the anger and the threats of breaking up, or not committing to plans because of small things. I know it’s not small things to her.. but I don’t take kindly to name calling or shouting as I’m a very chill dude in that sense, and being victim to emotionally abusive relationships it almost  gives me ptsd when she starts shouting out of nowhere and calling me names. I’ve tried to tell her that these outbursts are effecting my mental health to the point I’ve been in tears as stupid as it sounds I get scared. She’s not a horrible person she’s got a lot of love and she’s honestly a hit with my family everyone loves her! But honestly I’m struggling and feel like I’m loosing a constant battle. I try to keep her positive even at the hardest times but she’s so close minded and doesn’t see the big picture and how it’s effecting me. I know I’m not perfect and I’m sure sometimes I could be more understanding of her but she doesn’t talk to me about the issue she will just be balls to the walls pissed off over something and there’s nothing I can say or do to help, she just gets worse when I do and makes everything my fault. Days later she won’t apologise and just rant about her issues like nothing even happened ☹️
