be8bfc8fa0256c88e83d2e81c6317abac20869a7e68a29b6e6ff721dfa03971f;;;I’m tired of being blamed;;;I (F 26) admit that I have my fair share of anxiety just as any other person would, but I am growing more and more tired of having it being used against me...Every time an argument comes up, I get the blame of my anxiety making me “think too much” alongside a strong dose of defensiveness from him. Is this common for people with ADHD? My BF (26) has been diagnosed since early childhood and is currently medicated. I just feel like I’m at my wits end with constantly being accused of being a “bickering nag”. Also tired of not feeling like I can rely on him for emotional support. It just feels like anytime I share how something’s negatively affecting me, he either dismisses it or tries to downplay it with his own negative feelings, and I am left having to now comfort him. We have this vicious cycle of arguing every 2-3 weeks over the most minuscule things and it always ends in him not really taking responsibility stating that we should end things. It’s all wearing on me and idk what to do anymore. I love him and have been with him for 5 years but it sucks feeling like I have to walk on eggshells. Has anyone experienced anything similar? And if so, how did you tackle these issues?
