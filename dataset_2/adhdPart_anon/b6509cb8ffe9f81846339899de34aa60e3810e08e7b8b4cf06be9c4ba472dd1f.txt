b6509cb8ffe9f81846339899de34aa60e3810e08e7b8b4cf06be9c4ba472dd1f;;;I want to talk to my Boyfriend about his ADHD;;;I'm the non ADHD partner and my boyfriend has been diagnosed with ADHD.   My boyfriend and I have been dating for 6 months now and things were going great during the first 3 months of the relationship. We used to spend a lot of time together and talk to eachother frequently.   But over time he stopped taking the initiative to text back, make plans and even talk and this made me feel extremely sad and frustrated. I didn't talk to him about this earlier because he was very stressed out about his exams and work and I felt that talking about these problems would make him feel even worse so I put it aside for later.   But overtime it just got worse and now I don't know how to bring it up. The thing is, I'm not sure if this has a lot to do with his ADHD and if so I don't know how to bring it up and talk to him about it. This is the first time both of us are in a relationship so all this is very new to us and I have a feeling that he isn't aware of his ADHD affecting it.   I really want to talk to him about it and sort things out because I love him a lot and care about him but I don't want this to hurt him... How do I go about it?
