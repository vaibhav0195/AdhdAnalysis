471592293a50dac8a371e817ebbd8d2282ea0af6529061892aa435fed975c08e;;;Existential crisis over leaving for a week;;;My SO (DX) has been in a rut for a while, at one point I suggested me leaving for my parents' for a week in a different state to give him some space; he agreed that might be a good way to practice being accountable for getting certain things done around the house that I normally do. I can't decide if it would be healthy or not (he'd be completely alone for a week and has been going through a period of depression) and may also be procrastinating because I'm diagnosed OCD and have been a bit stressed at the idea of interstate travel during a pandemic.
