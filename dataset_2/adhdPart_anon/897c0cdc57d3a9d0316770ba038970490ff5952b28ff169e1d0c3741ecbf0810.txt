I wouldnt say I'm having second thoughts but there are some things that worry me. I keep imagining becoming one of those divorce statistics.  My partner has tells me if I ever try to leave, he will stalk me until he gets thrown in jail or committ suicide. We had a bad fight once. He was crying plotting his suicide, I felt terrible. Something about this has always sat very wrong with me regardless of an argument or not.  He's overly obsessed and emotionally depended on me. I dont think its healthy. He tugs on me and sometimes I get hurt even though I dont believe he realizes hes that aggressive. He refuses to be denied a kiss or cuddle because he relys on it. He will pout until he gets what he wants. If I try to draw boundaries because I want my space or dont want to be tugged on or crushed it starts an argument over his need for physical affection.   He doesn't try to grow or work on himself. Theres no effort present on really anything. He takes his medication but spends the majority of time on his phone reading or gaming. I feel bad but I almost end up taking care of him like a parent I feel like I'm enabling him.   He shuts down and won't talk to me when I try to push him to be better, productive and not sulk. I feel like I'm the bad person. I almost feel like ever since he was diagnosed it's become the thing he falls back on for reasoning.
