My partner has been super busy with work and school lately. Today, I found out they’ve only been drinking one Ensure protein drinks per day and had one dinner in the past 3 days. Am obviously super worried but I know I can’t force the meals, especially since we are not currently living together.   The only idea on my mind right now is to send them more Ensure drinks but they may not remember to drink more than 1 per day.   Looking for your best or go-to tips and tricks to keeping your partner nourished when they’re super busy.
