20d32ec061560e6a868ed14bb6359d94108c400c7020dd6c042ea193b1e720ab;;;A New Initiative;;; Hey everyone,  As we all know, ADHD is a highly stigmatized condition. I believe this stigma comes from a severe lack of empathy and understanding in the general population.  I believe we can use our collective voice to make a difference in how people perceive ADHD. We can bridge the empathy gap by sharing our stories, perspectives, thoughts and beliefs to the world.  That’s why I’ve decided to start a Twitter page, “Break The Stigma - ADHD”, where people affected by ADHD (either directly or indirectly) can anonymously share their stories.  If you would like to support this initiative by sharing your experience (280 characters max), please comment below or privately message me on Reddit or on Twitter @btsADHD  Thank you and have an amazing day!
