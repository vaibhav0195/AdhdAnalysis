I knew he’s had ADHD since he told me in the early stages of our relationship but from my perspective, he was just prone to acting goofy but also extremely creative.  In his adult life, he’s done really well at coping with his ADHD, but recently we’ve hit a rough point in our dynamic. Here’s what’s going on:  When I was a pre-teen a close relative molested me. Since then, I feel I’ve gotten mostly over it, however, I believe I have some PTSD from this where if someone approaches me or overpowers me physically, I get triggered by snapping at the person or freezing and getting overwhelmed.  My partner has a tendency to get excited and sometimes triggers this in me by touching me without warning or consent (sometimes in private areas).   I have expressed to him why I snap like this and have stated that we need to work on this as a team, but he takes it personally and says this makes him feel like a creep (and I don’t think he is a creep, I know he’s not trying to take advantage of me, but has a hard time controlling those impulses). He is not on medication and wants to avoid it if possible.  Partners of/or people with ADHD, have you experienced this, and how have you worked to overcome or minimize these impulses?
