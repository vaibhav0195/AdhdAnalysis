Husband and I have been together 8+ years and his suspected ADHD has always been a “quirk” in the background of our marriage. I’m a type A control freak, so I happily took on project managing our life with weekly to do lists and reminders for my husband.   He was diagnosed with ADHD and GAD a year ago and sporadically medicates with adderall when work is intense. He doesn’t take it otherwise, but vapes medical marijuana regularly. He doesn’t seem high all the time, but I know he takes hits throughout the day to manage his anxiety.   We are now first time parents with a 3 month old baby. And wow Newborns and postpartum hormones sure make project managing your life REALLY frustrating. It’s glaring of how unreliable and forgetful he is these days. As a result we’re fighting more than ever and my resentment is off the charts which is turning me into an awful human.   My questions are 1) will him taking his medicine more consistently help us?  I’m new to this and doing research to try and understand.  I’ve asked him to talk to his doctor more but no dice. 2) is therapy something I should encourage him to explore?  3) are lists and phone reminders the best system out there to help manage ADHD?  And should I be owning this or should I be encouraging my ADHD partner to take responsibility here?  On the plus side he isn’t crazy defensive about his ADHD and he wants to find ways to be a better husband and father, but he jokes that if he could remember to set reminders and do them in the moment, then he wouldn’t be ADHD. He does say I can have a bad attitude and it’s clear I resent him so that’s the core of our marriage problems - not his ADHD. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
