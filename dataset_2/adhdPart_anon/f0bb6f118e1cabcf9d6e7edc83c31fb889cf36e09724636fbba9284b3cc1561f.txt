He finally realized that I am upset with the lack of sex (intimacy) in our relationship.We both sat in the dark as we cried our eyes out and told each other our view on how our relationship has been. It's been rocky the past 6 months. We've been together 1.5 yrs together. He admitted that he hasn't been that horny. Idk what to do, all my worst worries and insecurities came out. He knows there's a lot of things wrong with him but doesn't really know what to do himself. I had the opportunity to finally agree with him and leave the relationship.  But I love him, and so instead I said that he and I should go to therapy together. What do you guys think? Did I make the right choice or should I have accepted defeat?
