In the beginning it was because he cared for me, since I am bipolar and sleep is one of the best ways to keep it in check and see if I'm stable. The thing is, it has gotten quite out of hand.  Recently I've been able to keep a healthy schedule for me where I go to bed around midnight and get up around 10 or 11 AM every day. I don't have a job atm so I don't need to get up earlier than that. He, however, deliver stuff as a truck driver so he is often up very early (3-4 AM most days). Now, he is unmedicated but diagnosed with ADHD and, as far as I can see, struggle some to keep a healthy sleep routine himself. Sometimes he works with very little sleep and sometimes he sleeps most of the day, often irregularly. That's okay with me, if only he could have a healthier take on my problems with sleep, but instead he makes it feel like I am not enough no matter how well I am doing.  Tl;dr: SO is constantly finding faults with my sleep schedule, no matter what I do. Nothing is good enough. Is this normal for unmedicated ADHD?  He doesn't do this when I am there irl, btw. So it might be him acting out because he is missing me. I don't know. Thoughts?
