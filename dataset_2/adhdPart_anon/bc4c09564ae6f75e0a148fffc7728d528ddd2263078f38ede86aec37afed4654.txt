Here’s my background 37F married 13 years (together 16) to 35m, two children 10M, 13F.  I adore my spouse. He makes me laugh, listens, and has seen me at my ugliest. He’s kind. Sensitive. Good father (although I do have to remind him to put down the screen.)  He’s medicated and has had a diagnosis for a half dozen years. Met with therapist this year, but stopped following up at some point during the year.   This year has been really hard. He was out of work for 6 months and I work in public service so I don’t make enough to support us. He has struggled with depression, which is now (knock wood) managed. That being said, we’ve talked SO MUCH this year. I feel like we’ve made huge strides in communicating and I think I’ve grown a lot in my understanding of what he’s going through.   Right now, we’re running short of money and he’s doing a small amount of contracting work. 3-5 hrs per week. He’s only sporadically applying for more work, so I feel like I don’t know what he does all day. He works from home. He doesn’t volunteer information about work, money, what he’s doing, how it’s going so I have to ask specific questions.   My question is— where do we go from here? I need him to work. I ask “do we need me to get a second job?” to which he says no, which is a reasonable response, he doesn’t want to say yes to that question. I hate even asking it, because I know he’s in a fragile place right now.   We’re trying a thing starting Monday where he is going to talk to me about the specifics of what he’s doing by midday or he’s going to come to town and work in a different place to hopefully break whatever cycle is happening in his head.   I’m really dedicated to this person, but I can’t lose my house.
