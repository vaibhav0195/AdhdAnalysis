After being diagnosed at 30, I realized a lot of what caused problems was not just immaturity but ADHD symptoms. It’s a year later and I’m still really struggling to accept what it means for our lives. For better or worse right? It’s not his fault. But I didn’t know that this is what it would be like. And not to mention the YEARS of misunderstanding that led to loads of resentment. It’s done a lot of damage. How can I get over the expectations I had of my marriage and move forward? Edit: he won’t go to therapy

He has to go straight from jujitsu to work. This has led to him leaving stuff at home that he needs for work. Our youngest also has PREK in the morning on Tuesdays.   Rather than him running home when he forgets something (this happens quite often), he met me at our sons school for pick up. It’s between work and home and close by the gym.   So now every Tuesday we met at the school a little early and sit and talk in my car. Our son gets to see his dad for a few extra minutes. His forgetfulness was the catalyst for the few extra minutes of time together on Tuesdays.   Just wanted to share something positive! Hope everyone has an amazing day today!
