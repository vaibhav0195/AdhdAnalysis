24778218d8bcf0a9eb76787d241d5db4dfec74189ea5e27af21e8a87abb7a537;;;Being married to ADD/ADHD is the most painful relationship I’ve been in;;;I understand everybody struggles &amp;amp; everyone has issues, but I really don’t think there’s a worse match than being tricked (how I feel for mine) into marriage by an ADD ADHD person, when they Know they’re ADD ADHD and they **CHOSE** to Not say anything about it (this is my life—he told me AFTER we married—and pretends like it Doesn’t have an effect on our relationship)  I wish I could turn back time &amp;amp; Not marry them—the neglect, ignoring, explosive temper, being the last priority is not what I thought of when I said vows, “to love and **cherish** ‘til death do us part”.  I don’t want to hear the, “have mercy on them” spiel as I repeat that daily—if not Hourly—to myself.  What I want to hear is Hope—hope that he Can change; hope from others success stories in being prioritized by their spouse, or, hire they make the sexless, neglectful, parent/child, “unfuckable roommates” marriage work for them.

We were going to go on a cruise, $300~—it canceled. Then it was rebooked for *September* (that’s Not our anniversary. So, are we Not celebrating—in **any** way—our anniversary?)—*he* payed more money to the tune of $1,000+ (**Completely** Unnecessary)  aaaaaand it was cancelled, again. He wanted to rebook, a third time. I said, “I’d rather not 😐😑 we can just book a cruise when we **KNOW** cruises are going to be *happening*.”  He bought me a gift—$100 worth. I see the charge on the bank statement &amp;amp; ask him about it (we’ve had card theft/fraud a few times), “Oh, it’s a gift—don’t look into it—it’s for our anniversary—it’s your gift. Don’t look into it, ok?!”  He bought me $100 worth of makeup.  I don’t wear makeup.  I haven’t worn a full face of makeup since *BEFORE* we met (9 years ago).  Being “natural” is one of the things (he *said*) he likes about me.  Why the Fu*k did he buy me makeup?  **FOR OUR FOUR YEAR ANNIVERSARY!** 😤😡🔥  I would be more prepared for him to admit he’s cheating. 🙄😑🔥  ———  In case any *non-makeup wearers* are reading this, people put makeup on to make themselves *More Attractive*. This F%#@&amp;amp;r bought me **makeup** for our four year anniversary—the message there is that I’m not attractive *enough* for him 😤 *Before* him, I had Great confidence; throughout our marriage I’ve stayed close to my *high school* weight—[without giving a ton of personal info] I have stayed a size 8~. There are other features he says he’s attracted to that I haven’t changed—because he says he’s attracted to them. GraaAAAAAAHHH! 😤🔥🔥🔥  ———  BEYOND the overwhelmingly offensive, impersonal nature of the gift 😤 he *knows*—becauseI hace **told** him over 5 times—I have a **bad** “relationship” with makeup.  *Eaarrrrrrly* in middle school my *mother* “encouraged” me to wear makeup to cover my early, pizza-face acne. Her “encouragement” escalated to the level she wouldn’t *let me* get in the *car* if I hadn’t put on *Enough* makeup…even when I had 2 full layers of *Full face*  makeup on. She would yell at me, blame *me* for “making the family late”, follow me inside the house, apply *another* full face layer of makeup because I “didn’t” cover up (the overwhelming redness from) my acne “good enough” al while *blaming me* that I was “doing this **On purpose**“ (???)   So the whole “makeup is Fun! Let’s *express* ourselves through color &amp; style” **NEVER**  happened for me; instead, the Makeup Message I got was, “ you need to hide your face—is Hideous! You didn’t put ENOUGH on—More! I shouldn’t be able to see any color of your Skin; only the color you Put On!”  ———  he’s *Terrible* at surprises and after the first one (wedding ring) I suggested we *never* “surprise” each other again. He is “Capital T, I will never forget how awful/Humiliating/last-minute-and-Completely-unplanned/unthoughtful/self-centered this ‘surprise’ gift/date/idea you had ‘for *me*’ was.” 🙄😐🙄😐😑😶Yay. You gave me a *thing* miss I have to *LOSE MY FU%KING MIND* like as if I care—or even know—what this is. Yay me, I got another ‘gift fit me’ that was Obviously for someone else.”  For *my* birthday last year he bought “us” season passes to the theme park **he** dreamed about going to as a child 😐 I didn’t know about this place 😐 i didn’t care about this place—it wasn’t special or exciting to me—I had been to enough theme parks I didn’t care to go to *another* one 😐 I didn’t ask to go there 😐 and I *certainly* didn’t ask for him to spend more than he’s ever spent on a “gift” ($200 season passes + $15/meal food + $20 parking + $35 food passes + [gas each trip] + etc.)  When I pointed out to him that:  1. I DIDN’T ask for this—he referenced a *conversation* we had about it. How *excited* **he** was about the park he “never got to go to as a kid” &amp;amp; how I said “that sounds nice” meant I **totally** wanted to go **More** than he did.   2. This wasn’t a present for *me* because it was centered on the park **HE** “never got to go to...*as a kid*”. His response, “NO! This is a gift For YOU because I *gave* it to you 🤩😁😁🤩🤩😁😁🤩🤩😁😁😁🤩😁🤩 Aren’t I a great husband!!!!?!???!!? I spent, like, $300+ in this... so *we* could... every weekend...and it’s only [$] more if we get a parking pass...and the food passes [$+]...and...and...”
