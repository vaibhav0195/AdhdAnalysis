Mostly:  * my wife cannot get out of bed in the morning, she'll wake up and probably sit in bed for 3-5 hours playing phone games until she gets up and moves to the computer * she cannot keep her space clean at all; asking her to throw away an empty can of soda can lead to a heated discussion if not approached in the right way/at the right time * any task at all is completely overwhelming, I can only give her 1-2 small tasks to do the **next** day, because mentioning the task is too daunting for her by itself and has basically sapped all of her capacity for the current day * anything that requires a phone call to schedule basically needs to be bookended with 1-2 hours of stress-free time, since it takes so much of her energy, or I do it  This is not meant to be a vent post, so I apologize if it sounds that way; I am just trying to paint scenarios that are common occurrences, whether they're ADHD related or not. I love my wife a lot, but COVID has really brought out the worst in what feel like are ADHD symptoms. I could be too narrowed in and armchair misdiagnosing her, but at a cursory level it seems like ADHD might fit the bill for a lot of these issues, and then anxiety and inadequacy stemming potentially from the fact that she's frequently overwhelmed causing some other issues?  Does this sound like a potential fit? Obviously I'm not going to diagnose her myself, but it feels like we should get her to see someone; the only problem is, I don't know how to approach that conversation or encourage her to go talk to someone since she's basically unable to schedule anything herself. I don't really know how to spring the conversation of "Hey honey, I think you have ADHD, let's get you talking to someone" out of the blue on someone that has probably never considered having themselves as having ADHD before
