As an ADHD wife, with a non-ADHD partner; I have recently decided to get treated with medication again. Although the medication helps on many levels, it doesn't do everything. *Because it is only of recent, within the last few weeks that I have learned how deeply ADHD behaviours have affected my marriage - I just want to share my thoughts and understandings at this juncture*. Of course this is just from my point of view but it may shed some light on what's going on inside our minds and at least help me get this off my chest.  **ADHD : no medication, when the meds wear off**  * We are constantly changing our minds and that's just us * **We don't intend to hurt you** or others by what we say, forget or don't say * We are very **emotional and overly reactive** \- but I assure you, once when we get upset and say something we don't mean, after some time - after we actually are able to cool off - we will usually see somewhat rationally again and say what we do mean. The intensity on how deeply we feel emotion is about 10x-20x how deeply you feel an emotion. * **We have no idea how much we live in awareness we have**  \- we are literally constantly distracted or daydreaming even if we think we are focusing * We are great at putting the **mask on of "normality"** and although we may get used to it - we are struggling inside in ways most cannot imagine. It zaps us of energy * **We are operating on auto-pilot**. We literally are a series of conditioned reactions. Not because we want to, but because until we are diagnosed and take action for some sort of treatment (medication, behavioural or both) - we have no idea that this is happening * When we are crying, upset or in a emotionally vulnerable state, **please don't give us advise - just listen to us compassionately.** Wait until we are calm and better to offer any advice. * You may feel like you don't really know us because we can't properly communicate our thoughts * **We may text you or interrupt a lot** **in conversation**\- but that's because we want to share something before we forget it. * Self confidence is usually low for us - and a chronic condition. Just as are negative thoughts.  * **We aren't lying** If it seems like we are lying, you have to understand that because our emotions and thoughts change so rapidly - we often have a different perception when answering your question the first time than the second time. Or we just freaking forgot. Our perceptions, and therefore related memories, change with our moods (which are related to our changing thoughts)  **ADHD :** **with medication/recently began being treated**  * **Give us some time to get used to our new working brains**. We are now processing things differently and beginning to see things with fresh eyes. * **ACCEPTANCE**. Please also give us some time to accept this entire ADHD diagnoses and the treatment. There is so much social stigma with it that it can be hard to swallow. For me, I have spent time looking back and seeing how many people I inadvertently hurt and have gone through periods of grief too. We may be relentlessly researching to understand ADHD, but understanding and learning is key for us to move on to acceptance * **Meds are only part of the solution** \- and that's if we can get them right. We also need to re-learn some habits that may not be addressed with medication; procrastination - how to organise - how to communicate - how to listen and a zillion other things. Your support is also invaluable and I ask that you all take the time to educate yourselves. * **The meds wear off** (psycho-stimulants) - and when they wear off, our ADHD comes back immediately (see first part of post). Until we get used to this and find/learn coping mechanisms this will happen  and/or the proper treatment has been found (duration of optimal efficacy with little or no side effects). It has to wear off sometime, or we may be up too late at night. * **If we behave differently** please let us know.  * **Remind us to be patient with ourselves.** Even with meds we still have this hardwired need for perfection and to get things done NOW. We aim for that even harder with meds sometimes. Remind us about this. * **We may re-evaluate life and see things from a new point of view because we are finally able to truly be self aware and introspect for the first time.**  There is so much more, but this is the info I felt like I wanted to share - some of the key points.  In short, depending on the person - we are often grappling just as hard as you are with this - and have been our entire lives. It's a struggle for both sides and it's best to do it together.  &amp;#x200B;
