She was diagnosed early on in the relationship, so its nothing new. We were both learning about adhd and navigating through life.  My question comes into play since about a year ago when we moved in together. She doesn't share with me any "cute" messages or couply things as she used to. We don't talk much during the day due to working (both wfh) and our only time together is spent watching TV. In the beginning I've tried initiating conversations and asking about her. But she answers with one word answers and doesn't ask things back. Honestly it's just being distant.   We've had conversations and she is working with an adhd coach and a therapist. But instead of seeing any improvements, we are more distant and she only initiates any meaningful interaction when she needs something (like me to cook dinner when hungry or to grocery shop).   When we address this, she says it is because of her adhd and just a symptom of that, but I am starting to wonder if there is more to it than just that. With her working with people to help with adhd, it's difficult for me to understand why things are worsening between us. I ask her what I can do to help or if we should brainstorm strategies to work together on a compromise (we always try meeting 75-25 instead of 50-50 since I know things are much harder for her) but even that she refuses and I have no idea what is going on inside her head.  Does anyone have similar experiences or advice that could help me out, or ideas on supporting her if she does need it?
