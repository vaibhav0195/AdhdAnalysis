He is undiagnosed and unmedicated. Presenting issues are hyperfocuses/ not spending time or giving attention and lack of follow through on tasks. Thanks so much , I'm really hoping to make this a positive and easy transition for both of us and chickpea (baby)

My  31 M ndx non medicated husband accidentally (and I truly believe this) left our back door not quite shut and our cat got out. He is taking it a lot harder than I would have thought. I am obviously sad, first pet I ever owned and she got me through grad school, wedding, family deaths etc. But I know it was a true accident and I'm not blaming him in any way. He was not paying attention and the cat got out, when we located her I couldn't grab her being 8 months pregnant and afraid of falling so she darted and is now officially lost. What can I do to help him feel better about this? I know those with ADHD can feel more intensely about things. Hes already cried and said "I fucked up" and it just breaks my heart. Any help is appreciated.
