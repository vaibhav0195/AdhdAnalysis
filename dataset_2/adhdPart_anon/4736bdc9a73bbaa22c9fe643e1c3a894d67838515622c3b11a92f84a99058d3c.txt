4736bdc9a73bbaa22c9fe643e1c3a894d67838515622c3b11a92f84a99058d3c;;;Minor incidents cause massive blow ups and fallout that persists. I’m really struggling. :(;;;My husband (dx/med) makes me so stressed I feel like I’m going to faint.   If a minor incident occurs (like what just happened where I was dismissive of something he said in a conversation) he hyperfixates on how I did the one bad thing and rides with it. Mind you, it’s the morning currently and he said that he thought today was going to be a good day but now it’s ruined because i was rude. I know I was being ruined (again, morning, and he wanted to have a deep conversation with me about something) and my mind was not having it. It’s not an excuse and I know that so I was going to apologize and then he blew up about it.   And now I know the fallout is going to persist all day and bleed into tomorrow.   These are always minor things. A blip a bump a whatever. In other conversations with other people it would be a brush off the shoulder. But with him? It’s the end of the world and he hates me and I’m such a rude bitch and I’m the worst. Meanwhile he is constantly mean and awful to me (even if he doesn’t mean it) and if I bring it up I can’t explain it because it hurts him and when I try to have a productive conversation it’s either: IM THE WORST WE SHOULD DIVORCE or OKAY ILL BE BETTER (no improvement or further discussion).   What can I even do to prevent this? Is this just RSD?  I don’t want to live the rest of my life constantly in fear over being less than perfect around him or else I’ll get this treatment. I wanna make things better :(
