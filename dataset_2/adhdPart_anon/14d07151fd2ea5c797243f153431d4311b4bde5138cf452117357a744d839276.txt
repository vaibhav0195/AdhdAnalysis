I’m loving it too because he’ll do more household chores without me even asking (we also got the audio book “adhd in marriage” and we’re going to listen to it together).  Anyway, He is a big very muscular guy who weighs almost 300 lbs. He only takes 10 mg Ritalin which lasts for about 6-7 hours.   My question is about the headache he gets with it- it seems to happen as it is wearing off. If he were to take it daily and consistently instead of sporadically would the headaches likely go away as his body gets used to it? He also gets decreased appetite and we think that maybe not eating enough is contributing to the headaches too.  Thank you!

I really would love if he just did chores that needed to be done without my asking so I don’t feel like a parent- I have enough to take care of right now about myself and my own stuff.  Yesterday I had to have a good cry and vent in the shower, and it was not meant for him to overhear. He was playing video games with headphones and I didn’t think he could hear. But he did. I said “I can’t do this” meaning what feels like 90% of running the household because my stress level was waaaaaay over the top. So he felt like scum hearing that and has been down all weekend.   We’re already in marriage therapy and our relationship is a bit fragile right now. So he asked if I was really happy being with him. (Divorce has been talked about in the past hence therapy) I told him just because I have a moment of frustration with him doesn’t mean I’m unhappy being with him. I feel like crap. But I also still need more help round the house and I’ve been working on voicing my needs and boundaries, and I did a crap job of that yesterday- I wish I had just been direct about what I needed in the moment instead of the venting session that was not meant for him to hear.  He sent me a good morning text today. Thoughts?
