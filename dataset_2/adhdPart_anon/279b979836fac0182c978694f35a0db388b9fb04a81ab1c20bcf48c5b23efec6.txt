We have been together for 4 1/2 years (we are long distance, im in canada and hes in the usa, we have been waiting 2 years for our marriage visa to be issued for me to move to the usa to be with him and we just about had it in April but covid19 hit so now its up in the air). I have decided to leave him now because of his ADHD (not covid19). Ill explain why.  &amp;#x200B;  When we first started dating he never told me he had ADHD, I had to figure it out on my own and I ONLY found out about it this past year when I asked him if he has it. He told me he has had severe ADHD as a child but never on meds for it. I asked him why he never told me about it and he told me "I didnt think it was an issue", but it is, it effects his daily living drastically but he doesnt think it does. Just watching how people react to him (he doesnt respect boundaries at all) and it is SO CLEAR it makes others uncomfortable, he constantly gets kicked out of places he lives for his erractic, loud, no boundaries, extremly messy behaviour etc.   It has also effected out relatonship drastically and we constantly fight because of his many symptoms. Im 30 and ive been in 2 other relationships in my entire life that have been very long term and have NEVER fought with any of them except this relationship. Examples, he lies to me alot and when I call him out on lying he gets extremly mad at me and says im blaming him when im simply stating facts (particularily lies about following nude women online on social media), has no boundaries with me (e.g will touch me sexually when I tell him no), Narcisstic as in constantly talks about himself and always seeks praise from other people, takes over conversations and never lets me talk and when I do talk he cuts me off constantly, I can never be right on anything with him (e.g I was in school for 4 years in a particular field and he will constantly tell me im wrong for what I do as a career and what I went to school for 4 years for), Forgets im even there when I visit him sometimes (e.g is an hour late picking me up from the airport because he forgot about me, will always be on his phone when we are out for dinner, he took me on a safari tour date and he spent the entire 2 hours talking nonstop to the female tour guide and literally forgot about me), he's beyond hypersexual and makes very innapropriate remarks constantly (he has fondled his sisters breasts infront of me before, thats how innnapropriate I mean), has no empathy (e.g I was crying my eyes out on the phone because something tragic happend to me and his first reaction was "aww I want to give you sex"..um WHAT?! im sitting there crying and you say that!? and then he went on a tangent for an hour talking about himself and video games like usual) there are many scenarios like that.  &amp;#x200B;  We have had many conversations over and over about these but nothing changes. He recently went on ADHD medication in Feb but I havent seen him since January mainly because of Covid19 so we havent been able to visit eachother. I have no idea in person how he is on meds but I cant tell much of a difference on the phone with him on meds. Since I have told him I want a divorce he has told me he's complelty different now on meds and everything will be better now but still I hear no difference on the phone and havent been able to see him in person to see. I have been very supportive of him at first with ADHD and read books and books to understand him but I cant handle it anymore. We probably wont be able to see eachother for another year (because of covid, but Im not sure on that time length) and I dont want to wait another year to finally see how he is on meds in person when I cant even hear a difference on the phone.  He's irate that I asked for a divorce and is in denial about how his ADHD symptoms has treated me in this relationship and wont admit it and is blaming me for all the problems in our relationship. Even me bringing up he has touched me sexually when ive said no to him he blames me for.  &amp;#x200B;  **My overall question is, did talking about divorce get your partner to really change and take ADHD seriously?**

He was diagnosed with severe ADHD when he was a child. Me and my husband are married but are long distant. I live and am from Canada and hes from the USA. We have been married for over 2 years (total over 4 years together) and we have applied for a marriage visa for me to move there to be with him (a CR-1 visa) which we have been waiting for almost 2 years now since we got married. I was basically at my interview for my visa to move there but the whole covid-19 thing happend and is now delayed until further notice.  Ive been having massive second thoughts moving there to be with him and contemplating heavily divorce, for awhile now, way before the whole covid19 thing. We have had massive problems in our relationship right from the start....I do love him, but its hard being with him (not because of our long distance). Ill explain...  &amp;#x200B;  When we first started going out I knew immediatly something was a little "off" with him. The way he acted, presented himself, hyperfocusing, extremly loud and erratic etc. I just figured he had a very "unique" personality. I however, got hooked on his hyperfocus on me (which completly faded away out of nowhere). Only this year I found out he has severe ADHD. He never once told me in our 4 years together, and he told me he's not on medication for it. The only reason I found out about him having ADHD is because I started doing research trying to figure out why he does certain things and acts the way he does, repeated patterns, and I felt like it was ADHD. I asked him if he had it and he said "oh ya ive had severe ADHD as a kid". He also said he is not on meds for it. I started delving into ADHD books, forums and its EXPLAINED SOOO MUCH, why he is the way he is and why we argue so much (because I couldnt understand why he did certain things and I had no idea about the ADHD).  &amp;#x200B;  His ADHD causes us immense issues, some examples (some of these might not be ADHD though?):  \&gt; chronic lying  \&gt; cant read body language when he makes people uncomfortable and me  \&gt; tunnel vision, aka says innapropriate things at innapropriate times, doesnt think of the consequences  \&gt;  has cheated on me multiple times (online) but then gets mad at me for getting mad at him for it  \&gt; Bad common sense, (e.g see's zero issue with accidently leaving the stove on all day for 12 hours while he's out at work) ( another example he fondled his sisters breasts infront of me the first time I ever met her and he couldnt understand why I was mad)  \&gt; extremly overly sexual, constantly wants sex, talks about sex nonstop, hyperfocuses on sex. Porn addiction   \&gt; unemotional, e.g if I go to him crying because im upset over something he will ignore it and start going on a monologue about himself or sex which makes me feel alone  \&gt; Turns every conversation into a debate or massive monologue  \&gt; Cuts me off constantly when I talk then turns it into a monologue about himself  \&gt; Not emotionally there ever, Its like talking to a wall with him  \&gt; Forgets things constantly  \&gt; Tends to belittle me and others when he talks  \&gt; He's been kicked out of multiple places he's lived at because of his ADHD   \&gt; Repeats the same conversations to me over and over, as if he forget we have had that exact same conversation 100x  &amp;#x200B;  Theres many more I can say but I dont want to make this too lengthy.  Ive sat him down over our years together and we have talked about these problems in great legnth (before me knowing he had adhd) and NOTHING EVER changes, it always becomes a repeated cycle at some point with him with him doing these things. Ive asked him to please stop chronic lying to me, please be there for me more and I tell him how he can be (but he still doesnt), stop cheating on me with other girls online but it never changes etc.  I told him recently I want a divorce because I cant handle his symptoms. When I first found out about his ADHD I was very supportive but nothing changed and he kept chronic lying and all the other things to me. I couldnt take it anymore.  When I brought up divorce he told me he will go on medication. So he's recently gone on medication for ADHD to help mitigate it (last 4 months been on it). He's also been reading lots of ADHD books and has promised to go to counselling for ADHD. The problem for me is he told me he wont go to counselling until I move to the USA. As I said before we are long distance, and because of COVID-19 I havent been able to go visit him (last I saw him was January, so I havent seen him in person while hes on meds so I dont know what he's like on them). He tells me he feels great on his meds but I hear no difference when we talk on the phone, hes still extremly erratic, cuts me off nonstop, belittles me etc.   &amp;#x200B;  I guess im lost on what to do, I feel a little betrayed him not telling me he had ADHD. I wish I knew early in our relationship so I could have understood things better. I also feel like if I move there to the USA to be with him things wont change. He says hes on meds but I hear 0 difference in the way he talks on the phone to me. He also said he wont go to adhd counselling until I move there but what If that doesnt even help? What if hes just saying that and then doesnt go? (again, he chronic lies). I dont want to be in a relationship with a chronic liar, cheater, and someone who isnt emotionally there for me etc. But it seems like he's trying....But im scared I will give up everything to move there to be with him for nothing and regret it.  &amp;#x200B;  I guess im looking for input or advice what to do....
279b979836fac0182c978694f35a0db388b9fb04a81ab1c20bcf48c5b23efec6;;;Just moved in, dont know how to deal with this....;;;hi everyone  (My husband is DX, I dont have adhd)  Me and my husband have been together for almost 5 years now. Our relationship has been a little unusual in the sense that we dated for 3 years long distance due to both of us living in different countries (I was from Canada and hes from USA) then we got married and applied for a visa for me to move to the USA to be with him. We have been married for 2 years now while still being long distant but I finally got my visa and got to move to the USA at the very end of this past November here. So we have been living with eachother for 2 months now. Previously while we were long distance we maintained our relationship through skype/calls/ and me visiting him every few months for about 7 days at a time over the course of our relationship.  &amp;#x200B;  Now, from the begining of our relationship I knew right away things were a little off with him, and we have had many many struggles in our relationship but worked through them. I never knew he had ADHD until a year ago when I finally asked him after doing my own research online and he said "well ya ive had severe ADHD since Ive been a kid". Not once did he ever tell me he had adhd in our relationship, I had to figure it out on my own and ask him after 4 years in after not understanding why he does alot of the things he does. Ive certainly never dated or been around anyone who acts like him ever (his fun and outgoingness is what attracted me to him). Hes never been medicated either until about 8 months ago because many of our issues in our relationship was infact due to his ADHD, so he went on medication. Before I moved to be with him I could hear a massive difference in the way he  talked over the phone with him, he seemed more calm and collected and he just really seemed like he was doing well and it made me happy.  &amp;#x200B;  since we have lived with eachother now for 2 months now ive felt like im already going a little nuts because of his ADHD symptoms even though hes medicated (maybe some of these arent adhd however im inclduing them because ive seen other people on here say very similar things about there DX spouse). keep in mind I did not exprerience some of these things or to this degree when we were long distant and visiting eachother the last 4 1/2 years) **Some things such as:**  &amp;#x200B;  **&gt;** He's extremly filthy, leaves food out for weeks to rot, leaves clothes/tools/deodarant/food all over the kitchen counter, garbage all over the floor, NEVER flushes the toilet and theres generally piss and shit on the seat from him. Ive polietly asked him to keep things clean and he gets SO pissed off and offended and gives massive attitude and starts to condescend me (example if I ask him to flush the toilet he'll be like " I do, it just keeps coming up" and ill say "well...no its you not flushing it because its never come up for me" and then he will take me to the toilet and flush the trigger down and be like "look, im flsuhing the toilet i know how to flush a toilet cant you see?" but with SUCH attitude....Keep in mind I never saw him this messy while we were dating him while I visited him. When I confront him even polietly on these things he tells me he is clean and that im someone who is overly cleaniness to the point of OCD and im not. This filthiness makes me extremly unattracted to him in bed so we never have sex.  &amp;#x200B;  **&gt;** Talks extremly condescending to me and has massive attitude. For example is I politely say "hey hunny would you mind rinsing the dishes before putting them in the dishwasher? ide really appreciate it hun" he will with such attitude and this pissed off look on his face be like "um I guess" kinda thing  &amp;#x200B;  **&gt;** He has a habit of not respecting me. He knows I dont like my tummy touched (dont know why but it really bothers me my whole life), ive asked him not to touch it in a certain way like grabbing it and he will and he knows im uncomfortable and will still touch it and be like "I know you dont like it but I do" and will continue doing it and when I start to get upset because im uncomfortable but he keeps touching me I will blow up abit but then he will get pissed off at me. This happend a few days ago and it ended up turning into a heated arguement because he wouldnt stop and I was extremly uncomfortable and he pushed me out the the way at one point (I didnt know I was blocking his way, but he never asked me to move he just pushed me abit and I was even more upset he pushed me)  &amp;#x200B;  **&gt;** He's always late for work because he loses track playing video games.  &amp;#x200B;  **&gt;** He extremly rude. Always calling people fat or ugly (he never really did this while we were long distant). I myself have struggled with eating disorders and am very self concious of my weight as ive gained alot and he knows my problems with food and being self concious, but he will call someone fat whos my weight and height and make fun of them. Which indirectly makes fun of me. Ive confronted him on this but he tells me to not take it seriously and that its not about me, but its still rude to me and to other people  &amp;#x200B;  **&gt;** He ALWAYS playing video games, and he always gets pissed off constantly at them to the point where I feel like he has anger issues.   &amp;#x200B;  **&gt;** I ended up getting food poisoning a few weeks ago, the night before we were supposed to go visit his parents for the first time since me moving to the USA. He knew I had food poisoning I was throwing up and really sick, and he had to go out and get me medicine. Not once the next day did he ask if i was ok to go make the visit still when I clearly wasnt. I sucked it up and went anyways though as we were supposed to see them the previous weekend but we had to cancel because he got called into work. On our drive to his parents I pointed out to these pretty mountains saying how one day I want to go camping up there and he said "are you sure?" and I said "yes" and he was like "um okay..." and for some reason he took that as "lets go up those mountains now" so we drove up the mountain but it was EXTREMLY windy (like notstop tight turns, felt like I was on a rollercoaster for 15min straight it was awful) and I kept telling him "im gunna throw up" (I even said this before we went up the mountains) and he was like "well you said you wanted to go up the mountains, we could have not gone up here there was a straight road right through we could have taken" and I was like "I said one day I wanted to go up them when we go camping, not now!" and I got upset and said to him "why would you take me up the windiest mountain ever knowing I just said before we went up that I was gunna throw up and knowing I have food poisining? I sucked it up enough trying to go visit your parents today while having food poisoning im already struggling feeling sick" and he got mad at me! he was livid with me. Not once that night asked if I was ok even though I was clearly struggling.  We had a similar situation awhile back, I got really sick somehow, threw up in a parking lot and told him i need to go to the cvs across the street to get medicine. We get the medicine and then he says "he lets go in here and eat" and drags me into a restaurant to sit down as im huddling over and going to the bathroom every 3 minutes to puke. His logic is just crazy to me sometimes.  &amp;#x200B;  **&gt;** Christmas day he started a fire, I freaked out out of being scared and he said "meh its no big deal"  &amp;#x200B;  Guys how do you deal with this? I didnt have really these experiences with him while visiting him while long distance the last 4 1/2 years. This is hard to handle even though hes medicated. Hes on Adderall. Any advice for any of these?
