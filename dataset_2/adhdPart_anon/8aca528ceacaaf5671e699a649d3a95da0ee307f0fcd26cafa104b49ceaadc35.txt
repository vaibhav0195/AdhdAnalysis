8aca528ceacaaf5671e699a649d3a95da0ee307f0fcd26cafa104b49ceaadc35;;;How to talk to my wife about my feelings?;;;My wife (32, not diagnosed but in the assessment process) recently started suspecting ADHD and since then she's been doing a lot of reading on it. And she sends me things to read about rejection sensitive dysphoria (which I am suspecting I have too, which leads to a whole ton of fun...) and over 10+ years of being together I have basically learned not to say anything about the things that bother me, like dishes not being put away or having to ask about something multiple times to having to guilt her into going on a walk with me and the dogs (we got the second one because she had decided we needed a second dog and she wanted to do a ton of training and has she done any of it? no.)  I don't want to have to apologise for cleaning the living room when she is sitting there or trying to not have bills all over the house or have her be grumpy and short with me and the dogs when I say I can't handle two dogs on a walk on my own and that she has to come with. I apologize and make sure to not let my hurt feelings into my voice when she tells me why what I did hurt her. In the past when I tell her how I am feeling she takes it really bad and has been so stressed she hurts herself (scratching herself until she bleeds) and she fears I will leave her.   After finding this place and reading I have been trying to come to grips with the fact that things most likely won't change, that this isn't just a phase and things will get better. And I had told myself I'd be willing to shut up about my feelings for a while, but not forever.   &amp;#x200B;  TL:DR: How do I talk to my wife about my negative feelings when she reacts with fear that I will leave her every time I try?
