I (f/24) always thought it was a maturity thing that he would grow out of and that he would eventually be considerate of my feeling and needs. The reality of this being a disorder that might not get better is heartbreaking. How many of my goals and expectations for our marriage are going to disappear because I have to focus all of my energy into constantly making sure he is able to function?   The emotions I’ve been trying to keep under control for his sake finally boiled over. We had an explosive argument that ended with me just feeling like a jerk for telling him how badly he makes me feel because all it did was upset him. After we cooled off, he spent the entirety of our conversation talking about how much he is struggling.  I don’t think I said more than two sentences. I went completely numb with the idea of this being my life - him causing me to feel badly, me feeling worse for telling him how his actions (or more specially, inactions), make me feel, and then circling back to him ignoring my feeling again. Luckily, he’s very willing to get treatment, and I’m trying to learn everything I can about ADHD to hopefully find a better way to live, but I’m still grieving the life I thought we could have. I guess I’m hoping to find some positivity from other people in a similar situation.   Thanks for listing to my rant.
