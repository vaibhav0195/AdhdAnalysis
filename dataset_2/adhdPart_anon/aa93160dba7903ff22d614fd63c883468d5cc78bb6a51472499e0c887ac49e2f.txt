I’m worried about addiction.;;;First post here, hope this is okay. My fiancé was diagnosed when he was in third grade and has been medicated ever since. For the most part we have great communication - he takes feedback well and has given me good feedback on how to give him feedback without making him feel judged.   We typically watch TV together after dinner every night. He feels very restless at this time, which I’ve come to understand is one of the ways ADHD manifests for him. He started smoking weed to calm down every night about a year ago. Sometimes he’ll take a day, a week (or two!) off, but for the most part it’s nightly weed consumption.   I’m very nervous that this is an unhealthy coping mechanism and that he can’t feel “normal” without drugs. I know COVID is probably exacerbating this and I know weed isn’t THAT bad. How can I help him find healthier ways to feel less restless? CAN I help him here? TIA!
