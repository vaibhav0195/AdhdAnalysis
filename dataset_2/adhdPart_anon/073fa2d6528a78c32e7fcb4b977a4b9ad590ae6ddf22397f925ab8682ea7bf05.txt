I try to journal to get out the anger and work through it. I wanted to share an excerpt as I could use some solitary today while he “gives me space” (ignores me)  ———  Let’s ignore the fact that we stayed up until who knows how late; two-ish I’m guessing. Why? Because I felt sad that we don’t do things together that I like; not just games or movies. Even though I consciously used little to no “you” or accusatory statements he took it as a personal attack on him and responded in kind. As usual.   It’s toxic and selfish. I feel unsupported in my feelings and wants. I understand that anything that smells like criticism to him is in need of a strong defense. He takes criticism poorly, as some people do... cool for them; whatever. But when everything I feel, think and want is twisted into criticism because it involves him in ANY—even slight—way, everything then warrants an attack. That is when it becomes toxic.  When your knee jerk reaction to my feelings and wants is anger and resistance is when it is toxic. I’m sick of accepting the awful things you say to me just because your have ADHD and can’t help but lash out. It’s not an ADHD quirk that I just need to accept for the good of our relationship. That’s just the shield you now use to keep us from looking at your resistance to closely. I got the benefit of the doubt early on in our relationship. “I miss spending time with you” was seen as sweet and loving in the beginning; the sentiments were mutual and validated. Now it’s a source or anger and seen as criticism. That change occurred because you let it happen in your heart.
