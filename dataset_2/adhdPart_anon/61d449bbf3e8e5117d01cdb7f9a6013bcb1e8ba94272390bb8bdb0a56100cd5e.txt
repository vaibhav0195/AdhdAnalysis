We have been together for nearly 2 years. We have been having going through a bumpy patch for the past few months. He has been focused on his own hobbies and interests that he never makes time for me. This is basically the trigger of our arguments. I have tried to sit him down and talk but each time I try (and I am not even raising my voice), he stonewalls or gets upset and defensive to the point of asking for time out in the relationship. He does say mean things at that time. He forgets promises and when I remind him he will insist that he never said them (simple things like we will go hiking over the weekend).   As of late last week, he suddenly disappeared and refused to reply my texts or pick up my calls. I finally got a text from him 3 days ago saying he wants space. I don’t want to lose him and I am worried if he will forget about me should I not contact him. I am hoping those who have had similar experiences with their adhd partners to share with me some advice as to what I should do. I am feeling so lost and rejected.   My apologies for my long rant.
