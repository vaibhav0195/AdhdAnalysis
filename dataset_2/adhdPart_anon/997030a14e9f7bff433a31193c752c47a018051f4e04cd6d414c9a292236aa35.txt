Especially when he/she is always distracted by other things and don’t often show their appreciation for you?;;;I (31F) have been dating a guy (37M, DX ) for a few months now and so far I’ve experienced most things mentioned here ( hyperfocus etc) and this thread has helped me a lot to understand his struggle.  Recently I have been struggling with our communications and I’m feeling that I am not being prioritised and as a result, I am insecure about us. I know he has been distracted from work and he has not open up about his work stress etc. He’s always looked distracted when we go out on our dates ( we don’t live together) and our daily conversations are becoming shorter. It’s such a weird feeling because I know he cares a lot about me but he doesn’t show it often ( but when he does, it’s really sweet!)  It’s tiring trying to get his attention and I’m feeling a bit petty trying to make him to prioritise me. I’m always at a confused state recently and I am not sure where I stand in this “relationship” anymore. I’m trying to talk about it with him but I’m not sure where to begin because I’m conscious about his feelings and reaction.   Question to all here; what do you do to help yourself feel better when your SO is clearly not prioritising you? And how do you know that you’re still their no 1 priority ( and even if you’re not, how do you handle it? )
