d054ff418b25e3e57f883bc0d8ced3842c5f0a56521fd853e63115e18c86f0f9;;;Today was the first time I was fully able to stay calm and understand the issue without blowing up with emotions.;;;So Iv been trying to study about adhd and bipolar to get a better understanding about how to cope going out with someone with them and honestly it really helped me.   Well kinda because, so this is what happened he was at home and had a argument with his mom because she basically stole money from him. After the fight I guess she told him he’s got 30 days to find else where to stay. (Keep in mind this has happened before because all that really happened was he must have forgot that he agreed she could take out a little more for his groceries because he has to pay rent). I highly doubt she’s going to kick him out because she’s said it before.   So anyway he got mad kicked something, his foot started bleeding then he told me he’d call me back because of course he was angry. I then message him later asking if his foot is okay, he said yes and that he’s going to take a nap because his tired he had to clean the house, so I said okay and that was that.   Then I found out he was using his old Instagram page that was full of naked women pages that he knows I don’t like! The first time I found it out he got rid of them on his main page but still has them on his old Instagram. So I called him up a soon as he woke up took a screen shot and showed him, I called him out showing he was a liar because he told me he wasn’t using that page but all he could really say is he’s deleting the Instagram now.   Then the whole conversation changed to, he said he couldn’t deal with this anymore then tired to turn it on me and say meanish things. He said he wants to go back to school and get a car and feel like a man. When he said that I realised it’s that whole depression stage where he feels like he’s not doing anything with his life. Then It clicked in my head, so I reassured him he’s not going to get kicked out and that maybe he should start saving if this is what he wants to do I don’t want to stop Him. I tired to comfort him and ask him how he feels, he said numb.  So I’m guessing because I called him out on a lie on top of everything he’s overwhelmed to the point where he can’t think. He said I should just leave now because he just keeps disappointing me. I asked do you want to break up and he just kept saying he doesn’t know I asked again and again he kept saying he doesn’t know.   Then he said he’s just having a bad day. I told him I know, then he said he’s going to go back to sleep and that he will talk to me later. Now before we would have arguments like this but my reaction I’d take everything to heart I’d nit pick apart his words and not understand where his words where coming from and just cry from feeling so hurt. I feel like I handle the situation really well. I don’t really know where we’re going to go from here if he’s going to apologise or call me up saying it is over which I sure hope it’s not over because I love him with my heart and soul. And for the first time ever I didn’t leave this argument in tears, anxiety and wanting to sleep the pain away.   Has anyone experience this before. Did I do good? I’m not sure
d054ff418b25e3e57f883bc0d8ced3842c5f0a56521fd853e63115e18c86f0f9;;;Help;;;How do you start a conversation when your extremely mad. So yesterday I couldn’t talk to my bf about why he’s upset me because it was his birthday and new it would lead to a argument.  So last night we messaged me and said he’s eating dinner and he would call me after but he didn’t obviously 🙄 so now I can see he’s all over Facebook posting shit and I’m here fucking furious I could scream at him right now.
d054ff418b25e3e57f883bc0d8ced3842c5f0a56521fd853e63115e18c86f0f9;;;Being left on read really bugs me...;;;I guess it wouldn’t feel so bad if we wasn’t in a long distance relationship right now because that’s our only way of communicating text and calls and when I see him posting selfies while he left me on read how the fuck am I supposed to feel..!!??
d054ff418b25e3e57f883bc0d8ced3842c5f0a56521fd853e63115e18c86f0f9;;;I don’t know how much more I can take;;;So my bf has ADHD and we are in a long distance relationship and it’s starting to annoy me now because we had made plans for him to come to my country in February and now the plans have changed because he said apparently we never arrange that!  Now I’m mortified.  It’s like he’s not even trying to save money he just keeps buying games and pizza every weekend and other things.   Long distance relationship aren’t supposed to be forever but at the rate he’s going I will be in one with him for about 10 fucking years! When I told him that wasn’t the plan he got annoyed at me.  To be honest lately everything is getting to me from the empty promises to the no effort to the forgetting to call me back. This whole week has been absolutely horrendous for me and Iv tired to speak to him and all he can say is that I’m stretching this.   I think today I’m done I’m gonna have to end it we don’t talk about our future he doesn’t make any effort to see me or to even spend time with me on the phone and I can’t take it anymore he needs to realise I have a lift too
d054ff418b25e3e57f883bc0d8ced3842c5f0a56521fd853e63115e18c86f0f9;;;I don’t know what to do right now;;;So earlier we got into a argument and for the first time ever I kept my emotions under control. I use to take what he said to heart and pick apart his words and just cry cry cry. His day started off crap as he had a big argument with his mom, she told him to find somewhere else to live, but I know once there both calm down everything will be okay, then had to clean up a big mess at home then to top it all off I caught him in a lie and had evidence to prove it. I don’t want to get in to details but it is what it is, so I called him out.   He had just woken up from a nap and called him up and I showed him the evidence and waiting for his response. He acted like he didn’t lie and it’s all in my head. Then he said he couldn’t do it anymore, and that clearly he keeps disappointing me, I asked did he want to break up he said he doesn’t know I asked again and again and he said the same thing.   I asked him how he felt and he said numb and I’m guessing it’s because he got caught in the lie and now he can’t think at all, he’s depressed about everything else so this just topped it all off. He said he wants to focus on school and get a car and a house. So I know he’s going into depression when he starts talking about things he wants but finds it hard to work towards. Then after he said he’s just having a bad day and that he loves me he will call me later he wanted to go back to sleep and that was that.   Today I went gym I felt good and now I’m home I’m trying to distract my self but it’s all not really working, it’s like I’m in limbo waiting for him to call and say sorry and too see where we are it’s feels so unresolved. It’s hurting now and I can’t reach out and call him because he said he’d call me. I just want to sleep away the time until he calls but I don’t want to go to that dark place I think now I’m overthinking again help :(
d054ff418b25e3e57f883bc0d8ced3842c5f0a56521fd853e63115e18c86f0f9;;;I guess this is a little vent/ I’m not even sure what this is...;;;(Pretty long, sorry for the formats of this post)   So I’m in a long distance relationship, we have been together just over a year now and we have had our ups and downs just like everyone else.  Last month I had the worse month ever because of my mental state and my boyfriends ADHD all piled up it to arguments and breakdowns.   I developed depression and anxiety thinking about the future, the past, if he truly loves me, what’s he doing, when will I find a good job, all my friends live so far away, I’m so Isolated, just all these bad negative thoughts that I was overthinking about it just ruined me, I had gotten so use to negative ways of thinking it became a habit.     So the start of this month I had a realisation and started to take steps to help my self. I started meditating, shutting the negative thoughts out, praying (I am religious) also going to the gym. And it all really did help me it’s just maintaining and keeping it all up that can get a little hard because once I started to feel good I kinda stopped and then I started thinking negatively again.  Well it is a bad habit so just like any other bad habit I’m going to have to keep on at it until it’s sticks in my head like a mind set.   So it’s been a couple weeks now Iv been doing so much better I feel it in my self how I’m more positive and happy not stressed out at all. But now I’ve realised something.  My boyfriends adhd, Before id blame my self for argument because I was the one always acting crazy popping off at him and because I was already unstable I would really think that it was just me until now.   So I started to do some research on adhd and medication and about relationships. And I’m not going to lie over 2 weeks we have had little bickering arguments and they all start with me just asking the simplest of questions then he will always gets on the defence and then it turns into a huge argument start swearing and raising his voice.   So now that he has seen such a huge difference in how I am he called me one morning and told me he’s sorry for the way he’s been acting he doesn’t like shouting, he then proceeded to say “what’s wrong with me I push every one I love away, I yell at my mom and my brother and I don’t like it, I need help I’m going to start to better my self”.  I was so happy to hear him say that because our love for each other is so strong, we don’t want to lose each other but we are taking our problems out on each other.   So anyway the same day I spoke to him about taking medication but he refused he said he hated it so much it made him feel like a robot. I can’t force him but I also couldn’t recommend anything else because I wasn’t sure what other help he could get.  Then I stumbled up on a article and there was more than one that said the same thing. Basically saying if you have adhd and you don’t take medication the relationship WILL NOT WORK. So now I’m so worried and it’s got me overthinking again but just about this subject of is this going to work.   I’m just so scared I’m going to lose him I keep thinking what if he loses interest just, what if this, that and the other I’m getting extremely scared and sad the more I read. He said he’s going to better him self but he won’t take medication so what else could he do. ? If he proceeds to stay like this I can see my self wearing down eventually and having my heart broken because I still love him extremely and I don’t want to lose him.  So now realistically if he doesn’t get help I can’t stay in a relationship with him because it wouldn’t be fair to both of us to continue arguing and hurting.  Nothing will change because our brains are wired differently, I have helped my issues but now he needs to take control and sort his issues out because we will get no where.  I know it takes time and it may take longer for him because of his adhd and he’s a procrastinator but I’m willing to wait because I don’t want it to end I love him so much he is honestly the kindest, loving, romantic , funniest, spontaneous person I have ever met I have never met anyone like him so I don’t want to lose him.  I could sit here for hours explaining the way he makes me feel, I’m sure you get the gist.   ☹️😢😭
d054ff418b25e3e57f883bc0d8ced3842c5f0a56521fd853e63115e18c86f0f9;;;My boyfriend doesn’t know the effects of adhd or the effects it’s having on our relationship. And I’m scared our relationship is hanging by a thread.;;;(Were in a long distance relationship)    I’m going to make this as short as I possible can, my bf told me he had adhd 3 months into our relationship, I my self knew nothing about adhd or the effects it has on him or our relationship.   If your read up on the effects ADHD has on relationships you’d know how it effects us non add persons. And with that said 9 months in to the relationship it started to take a toll on me and I never knew why. Then one night it was like a light bulb went off in my head and I started reaching up about adhd and also the effects.  The best way to describe it would be it felt like 2 pieces of a puzzle clicking together.   All that he has told me about him having adhd is that he was diagnosed as a child tried medication but it made him feel like a robot and he doesn’t like the fact that it’s one chemical away from being cocaine.   So let’s fast forward to now, just like every other relationship we have had our ups and downs but there’s a problem, small disagreement turn into arguments, if I get upset because let’s say he forgot date night it would turn into argument. I never shout at him I always talk in a low voice, and explain my self as best as I can but it never works he thinks I’m coming at him.   It’s gotten to the point now where I feel like nothing is ever resolved so it’s like he’s pulling away, he doesn’t get enjoyment out of our conversation anymore because he thinks I’m out to start arguments out of nothing and it’s hurting me because I’m scared to talk to him about his adhd and why he feels the way he does and why he always gets angry but talking to him over the phone isn’t how I wanted to tell him. I’m supposed to see him in July but he told me he needs some time to think, Day by day plane prices are going up and soon I won’t be able to afford to go see him. I feel like our relationship is hanging by a thread.   I just don’t know what to do I wanted to talk to him last night but he Wasn’t in a good mood he told me he wants to be alone right now he will talk to me later. I’m just so broken up right now because I feel like I’m withholding information that can help him and our relationship but I don’t want to have that conversation over the phone I want to tell him face to face but at the same time I feel like it’s the key I know there’s hope but he doesn’t.  Maybe he thinks me coming to see him will be a bad idea because we will still fight.   Sorry it’s all over the place I’m just really shaken up right now.
d054ff418b25e3e57f883bc0d8ced3842c5f0a56521fd853e63115e18c86f0f9;;;I don’t even know what to call this;;;So, I’m 21F and he’s 27M ADHD depression and not to sure on what else it is that he has.  A few days ago we had gotten in to a argument over something I saw and took out of context, in shock I tried to break up with him I didn’t want to hear his explanation I just blocked him so he couldn’t contact me. ( we are in a long distance relationship)   I cried and cried I ignored all his calls and messages then the next day I just felt like it wasn’t truly over I didn’t want to throw our love away with out hearing what he had to say. I opened the chat up and there about 100+ miss calls and a load of messages pleading me not to leave him and then he went on explaining what happened. I really should have Hurd him put because I blew it way out of proportion.    I write him a message saying that I was hurt and that I  was sorry for over reacting can we just let this make us stronger and push through. He read it but didn’t reply. I gave him about 1 hour but he didn’t reply so I called him and he said he was thinking what to say he said he read my message over and over and that he doesn’t know what to do anymore.   He said “ I don’t know if I’m In love with you, I don’t know if we would be together in the future, I’m not saying I don’t love you or care for you because I do I just don’t know if I’m in love”  I said so what’s the difference he said in love means marriage knowing that your the one for me I don’t know if you are.  So in my head I’m extremely confused because  1. By him saying he doesn’t know if he’s in love with me made me feel like what is he trying to say that he actually really doesn’t love me?  2. So if he wants to be inlove and he knows he’s not in love with me then it feels like he is telling me he wants to find it in someone else.  3. I was just blown down to be honest because the day before he was telling me he wants to be by my side, he was talking about our future and how we would travel and to now here him say this my emotions was all over the place my brain couldn’t think straight.    It felt like he was breaking up with me he sad he didn’t want to drag me along because it wouldn’t be fair which I know it wouldn’t be but I’m so confused he kept talking about the future this the future that. We had this conversation 3 days straight nothing felt resolved I was crying my eyes out thinking he was breaking up with me and out of frustration I was like Iv had enough, if your trying to breakup with me then do it don’t expect me to do it for you!! Say bye to me and I will leave. He said he couldn’t do it it’s not what he wants. my heart was so broken honestly.   I wasn’t thinking straight and I was in shock and trying to understand what he was saying I couldn’t think and then it hit me.  We have only been together for just over a year now we have only met once for a month, he hasn’t met my family or came to my country yet.  He is worrying about shit that hasn’t even happened yet, no one knows the future and no one ever will! It takes time to fall in real love with someone it won’t happen quickly.  I told him I’m not asking him to bend the knee and propose to me I’m not asking him to give me a baby we are still getting to know each other. I then told him quotes to stop worrying about the future! And read them all and said I was right and he was so sorry for being difficult the he told me he feels really depressed recently and that he’s scared and that he doesn’t want to lose me and that he want to be by my side.   So by the way he was wording everything and the inconvenient timing and worrying about the future and my lack of understanding because I was so confused our relationship nearly ended!!  Honestly I feel really stupid, I feel like I nearly lost the person I love because he worried about the future and had me worrying too when the answer was so clear NO ONE KNOWS THE FUTURE LIVE DAY BY DAY AND DONT WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE.  I was so stressed out and drained. I kinda still am I feel fragile I really don’t know how I feel if I’m honest.   I’m looking to go see a therapist soon because I feel like this knocked everything out of me.  I’m not sure what I’m looking for posting this but if you have had a similar story I’d love to hear that I’m. Or alone :(
d054ff418b25e3e57f883bc0d8ced3842c5f0a56521fd853e63115e18c86f0f9;;;First time being with someone with ADHD;;;(I’d just like to point out that we are in a long distance relationship for about a year now we have met once the second trip is about 1 month away.)  My SO has ADHD and it’s kinda wearing me down, My situation with living arrangements right now is lonely no friend nor family around me and it doesn’t help that my love is in another country and on top of it he has ADHD.  Some days he blows me up with messages calls and some days he will still call me but only for a few minutes and he would barley say much I’d just be listening in on what ever he is doing till he tells me he’s going to go and he would just hang up and not say love you not even bye.  This is so frustrating for me because I think I’m doing something wrong or I feel like he’s pulling away, he’s losing interest and then all of sudden the next day he’ll be all full of energy calling me making me laugh.   I know he truly cares about me and loves me so much but it hurts me sometimes,  To explain the feeling it’s like your partner is slowly falling out of love for you and then the next day they start showing you so much love and attention for a couple days or weeks and then later out of the blue they go cold turkey on you again.   It’s like up and down up and down it almost feel like your being strung along, iv never been with anyone who’s had ADHD before so I’m not use to this behaviour, if he didn’t have ADHD and acted like this I would think something was up for sure! But he does ADHD and i forget he does in fact I think the last time I read how to handle ADHD in a relationship was when he first told me which was months ago so I do forget how to handle these situations when they appear.   When we are together it’s a different story all together he can’t keep away from me and I love it BUT we are in LDR so it’s months until we can physically be together. I do love him with every inch of my heart but god it’s so hard when he gets them days where he barely shows interest   I do want to know if anyone has a similar relationship or experience. Or can give me some advise on how to cope or is this normal I love him so much I don’t want to lose him but it had been wearing me down emotionally I feel like Iv lost my mind right now   Thank you for your time :)
d054ff418b25e3e57f883bc0d8ced3842c5f0a56521fd853e63115e18c86f0f9;;;Can you understand why I’m extremely upset and why I reacted the way I did.;;;I posted this in the ldr community but no one replied and I really need advice.   So we are in a long distance relationship and so far Iv visited him twice. The last time I visited him the day before I left he would boast about how he needs to see me next in my country he has to come here he’d say. He hasn’t flown before so he was saying how he needs to get his passport and luggage the following week after I left as that’s when he gets paid.   So now 2 months down and he ran into money issues so all he could get was luggage. So this means he can’t see me as soon as he wanted to so it looks like I’d be seeing him maybe this winter. So I had a great idea! I asked him why don’t I come back to him mid October because his mom offered me to work with her so I could help saves and make money, spend time with him in the mean while and theeeen he could fly back with me to my country so he wouldn’t fly alone first time because he’s a procrastinator and I’m scared he’d get lost or lose something you know how it be. He’s not medicated soo yeahhh.    He said he’s think about it and speak to his mom. So last night I asked him what day in October would be good for him, and his reply was “no day, your not coming here this month or the next, I need to go to school and finish a course and I want to move out of my moms house”   So just a little info. Iv known him for nearly 2 years and from the start he’s told me he needs to go to school to finish a course. The first time I visited him I woke him up for school, he went the first day, came back and had home work, he didn’t do the home work or go back after that. And ever since when he would feel like his life isn’t going well he would keep saying he needs to go school to start a course that will help him get a job.    So anyway after he said that I went silent, my eyes just flooded with tears. Logically if he’s saying I can’t come see him because it’s not a good time and he’s trying to move out and go school he won’t have money to put a side to come see me. In my opinion going to school isn’t a good enough reason because 1 he never ends up going or 2 I’d never stop him from going because if I was there I’d be working. It’s a stupid excuse.     I got extremely upset so what ever came to my mind I blurted it out I was and still am upset. We just ended up shouting at each other because he couldn’t understand why I was upset he kept saying I was taking it over bored I’m acting like we’re not like not going to see each other again. But the fact is we won’t  for maybe a year if he’s saying I can’t come see him and logically you can’t save money to come see me and to move out with what money he gets.   He thinks he can, he keeps saying we will see each other again just not right now. I told him I can’t do ldr much longer if we only get to see each other once a year. The he just kept saying I don’t understand him and I do he just doesn’t understand my part or sound like he evens care. I ended up telling him to just fucking forget about me to move on and to not call me back. I was so heated. His brother told him to stop shouting so he said he’d talk to me later I told him not to call me back ever and he just said stop being silly he’s going to call me back then he ended the call.    So he didn’t end up calling me back it’s now the next day I’m 5 hours ahead of him so he’s just waking up now. I’m still hurt honestly I just don’t know what to do
d054ff418b25e3e57f883bc0d8ced3842c5f0a56521fd853e63115e18c86f0f9;;;I’m scared this is the final straw;;;So lately all we have been doing is arguing. Yesterday was really bad I was crying my eyes out having a break down pretty much all night and morning and he didn’t have a clue I told him how I felt and all he could say is why do you feel like that. He didn’t comfort me or nothing and just like carried on playing hi game and watching movies so that annoyed the hell out of me because it makes me feel like he doesn’t care.   It’s starting not to feel the same anymore Iv been trying to back off from calling him to give him space.  I feel like ya arguing is pushing him away and I’m scared I going to lose him so I’m getting bad anxiety by the way we’re In a long distance relationship and won’t be seeing him for a couple months how do I get things back to how they was before.
d054ff418b25e3e57f883bc0d8ced3842c5f0a56521fd853e63115e18c86f0f9;;;Wow just wow;;;So I’m on the phone with my bf (He’s American) and because I’m British he likes so put on a British accent but he just ends up sounding like oastine powers.  Anyway in his British accent he started saying “my baby is so sexy soooo fucking sexy” then he stuttered because he didn’t know what to say next then he said “my little........fat.....fat reared girl” he was laughing and then kinda started talking about something else to him self.  Once I Hurd him say that I was shocked I couldn’t say a word, I didn’t say a word.  This had happened before I can’t remember what we was doing but once again in a stupid accent he was messing around describing me saying I was sexy blah blah blah and then fat came out again.  Every time he has said fat, straight after he would try to change it because he knows it’s wrong what he said but he will continue and laugh. And he’s never said sorry either.   I wear a uk 18 Not trying to justify what type of fat I am but regardless he said it. And what makes it worse is I’m on diet which he knows about. We was supposed to get fit together he was going to start gaining, start weights and be healthy and I was on my losing weight And being healthy plan. Iv been doing my plan but he hasn’t been sticking to his end of the bargain but regardless I know I need to lose weight for my health.   But what he said really hurt me like it reeeeeally cut deep I feel like all he sees when he sees me now is just fat!  I feel strange now about losing weight like I know I’m going to keep going because it’s only going to benefit me but I don’t know how I should feel right now all I know is I’m hurt by what he said I feel stupid.  Recently Iv been so down with how I look Iv stoped wearing makeup and taking pictures of my self I hate looking in mirrors so hearing him call me fat out of all. I can’t help but cry I feel so upset.
