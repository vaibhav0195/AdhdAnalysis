The symptoms they do experience (poor time management, sleeping issues, depression, inability to complete tasks) are severe. In our relationship they are a caring person. However it feels like they will go through phases of enjoying being with me. for a couple months they will be talking to me all day and making an effort to be with me and love me. Two months later it’s like they’ve slowly lost interest and put me on the back burner of their life, and I have to struggle to even start conversations with them and it usually leads to a fight/ potential breakup because they don’t understand how ignored I feel. Then with time their regular loving self always comes back. Does anyone know if this distance is an ADHD symptom? I have no experience with it so I was wondering if this could partially be tied in to their likely ADHD or is this me trying to find an excuse for a major relationship flaw?
