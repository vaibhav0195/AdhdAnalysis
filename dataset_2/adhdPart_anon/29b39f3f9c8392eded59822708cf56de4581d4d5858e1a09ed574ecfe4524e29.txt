I have been with my ADHD boyfriend for nearly 3 years.  I do not want any advice to leave my partner, that is not happening. We have a good relationship, however I feel like he doesn't understand my feelings or needs.   He works as a nurse and when he comes home from work (around 10 pm) wanna spend some time togheter to talk about our days and do some activity togehter. When he comes home however we only talk for like 5 minutes before he goes on his computer and talks to his friends/play with them and doesn't leave his computer until he goes to bed at about 1 am   I have mentioned my dislike if this behavior a couple of times but he doesn't change his behavior. He says that he is socially tired after work and just needs to relax but I dont understand how talking to his friends instead of lets say whatching tv with me is more relaxing.   How do I make him understand that I want to spend time with him/make him want to spend time with me?

He is a big gamer and has been since he was little and playes computergames every minute of his free time. I struggle with having just a Short conversation with him daily. I feel like we have talked aboit my needs and want a 109 times and it seems like he understands but then the next day its like the conversation never happend. I am getting so fed up with this and I dont know how to keep going... I really love him and I know he loves me but its just so draining to always be the second choice...
