9adc08e08e780b67ac3029f64e0bda7eb42b7085c4364c20eb1401932c34858c;;;Problems with waking up;;;I cannot believe I just found this reddit! My husband just got his diagnosis after an agonizingly long time, and as our 4 year relationship has gone on, I always had suspicions and he finally got diagnosed and I was so angry ( not at him, but his parents, its another story )   He's ALWAYS had problems waking up, no matter how many hours he gets. My husband in the mornings HATES who ever is trying to wake him up. Like he would literally trade me for a MINUTE of sleep. He is so incredibly mean in the mornings and its a daily occurence that he hurts my feelings and yells at me. But he doesn't remember it, like AT ALL. Which makes things worse because he doesn't know how he hurt me. Anyway, when waking up by himself we have tried everything ( we still don't live together fulltime, were traditional ) but even putting alarms on where  he has to get up he will still go back to bed and sleep no matter how many times he gets up.  Some help please?
