8fdf0f4a31a839f63554c15e48a7de0cd9b55fad21ef79444ae9226f534c9cab;;;Am I selfish?;;;Been together 4+ years, married for a few months now. Like many of the posts I’m reading, everything was amazing in the beginning. Now, I struggle with getting him to be on the same page as me and we argue all the time.  I’ve just recently realized that he most likely has ADHD. I’m reading a book about it and it’s almost like the author was observing US.  I’ve mentioned it to him and his explanation “i think i’m just lazy” but I keep pushing him to see someone to get treatment. He doesn’t realize how on the edge I am all the time because it’s like having a giant teenager. Am I selfish for wanting him to get medicated? Nobody else in his life has complaints or has ever complained about his behavior so I sometimes feel crazy and awful for wanting to medicate him. I’m just over the very simple yet stupid arguments and disagreements that can ultimately be avoided.
