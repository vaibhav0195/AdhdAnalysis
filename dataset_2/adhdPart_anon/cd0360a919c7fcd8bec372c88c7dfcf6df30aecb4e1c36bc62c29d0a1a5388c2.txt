And NT partners, what kind of parent is your ADHD partner?;;;I'm (25F) in a happy and committed with my undiagnosed boyfriend (24M) and would very much like to start a family one day.   I'm interested to learn and know the experiences of being a parent while having ADHD. Is it difficult for ADHD partners and do you enjoy it or find it frustrating? And what's your relationship like with your children?  I'm also interested to hear the NT partner's point of view as to what the relationship of the ADHD partner and child(ren) are like :)

I understand that ADHD can be genetic so I'm wanting to know the likelihood of my boyfriend passing it down.  Just wondering if any of you have NT children, a mix of NT and ADHD children or all ADHD children?  Thanks ❤️
