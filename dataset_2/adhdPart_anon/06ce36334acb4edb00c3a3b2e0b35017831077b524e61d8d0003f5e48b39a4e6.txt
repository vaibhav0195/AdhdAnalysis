Every Sunday my family gathers at my parents home to share a meal. My parents, sibling and I are really close and we enjoy conversing during this time which can last up to a couple hours. On a typical night, we'll sit down to eat at 6:30 and finish coffee &amp; dessert by 8 after which we like to watch a show or a movie. Now, the trouble we're having is that my partner struggles with paying attention for such a long stretch. She's off her meds on the weekends and gets quite tired by the end of the day. She gets distracted on her phone at the dinner table and my family has started to notice. This weekend I was confronted by my sister and mother about our apparent 'rudeness'. After talking to my partner about this she's started to  ask me to change the format of my parents dinner party to accommodate her mental state so she doesn't have to "suffer through a long conversation".  My parents have mentioned banning cellphones from the dinner table and my partner has said she's started to reconsider coming if she can't be accommodated. She'd like everyone to eat earlier and move to a more comfortable sitting area at a scheduled time.  She often uses the cellphone at the dinner table to 'recharge her mind'. I just want to know if you guys have dealt with something similar before? What kind of special concessions have you guys made to help your partners? I've already suggested that she could leave the table to recharge but that didn't go over well. I hate being the middle man between two parties that I really love. I am open to any suggestions that may help.   Thanks
