It’s been about five months since I started dating my current partner, and I’ve noticed he is incredibly messy. Talking more than a bachelor pad’s amount, like clothes strewn everywhere, no way to distinguish clean clothes from dirty clothes, wrappers and bags on the table and ground, dishes piled up, bathroom a mess (unorganized), dead plants. He lives in a two bedroom by himself. His two small pets have one room. He’s great, we’re great, but I’ve lived with boyfriends before; he’s never lived with a partner before. I’ve cleaned up after one ex, and the other cleaned up after me. I can be messy but when I lived by myself I was messy a lot more. Is this something I should consider a red flag? I’m not moving in with him anytime soon but I also don’t want to waste his time. I’ve been to his parents’ and they’re way messy too, so it’s probably the upbringing. (He claims he has bipolar and/or adhd) I now live by myself in 200 sq ft so I can’t afford to be messy now. I have to unlearn the unhealthy habits and be more mindful of my space. My new medication helps me through the depression. SO is completely against medication. I... don’t know whether this is grounds enough to break up over especially since we don’t live together.
