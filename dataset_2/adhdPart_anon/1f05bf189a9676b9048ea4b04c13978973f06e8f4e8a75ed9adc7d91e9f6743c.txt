1f05bf189a9676b9048ea4b04c13978973f06e8f4e8a75ed9adc7d91e9f6743c;;;My SO is non-DX. He exhibits a lot of the symptoms and behaviors.;;;My SO and I have been together for over four years, and we live in separate places.  I got into a discussion on the "Weekly Rant" thread, but realize I am actually looking for insight and support.  I am not a psychiatrist, and I could very much be wrong about whether he has ADHD.  It came up when I was googling behaviors, and looking for answers to our challenges.  I am going to repost my "weekly rant" posts to this thread, in case anyone wants to offer some insight.  Thank you.
