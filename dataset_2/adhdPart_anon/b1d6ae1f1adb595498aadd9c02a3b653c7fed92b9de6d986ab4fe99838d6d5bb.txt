I did not know this sub existed until about 10 minutes ago. Reading your replies to all the posts is really hitting home to me and I'm being super emotional right now so I need to rant. He just found out he has ADHD.. not on meds yet -- going to get that sorted next week. He was on meds as a kid. Nevertheless, diagnosed or not -- I've been dealing with this since I first met him and as much as I try to understand (although I will never be in his shoes) and change my behaviour to support him.. I'm only human and sometimes snap. I sent him an email just explaining something that upset me and I asked how can I help you better to ensure this gets done. He messages me back highly irritable. He says he is already mad at himself and doesn't need to hear it from me too. Obviously I get drawn into this back and forth exchange because his reaction really upset me.     I don't know how to help him see my side of it. As much as it is not his fault and is not his intention and he is trying so hard.. I'm super overwhelmed. I feel like I'm put in a lose/lose situation where if I remind him, express myself.. anything.. it seems like I am treating him like a child, controlling him or patronizing him.      All of this is already difficult on us both but his irritability and his reaction afterwards is what just gets me so mad. I know it isn't his fault and he doesn't necessarily need to apologize but I am not a brick wall either meant to just take shit. I love you so much to want to help you and help us yet you want to just spaz at me. I literally approached the situation so kindly. I feel like if I were to stay quiet then I'd just be suffering on my own silently and honestly I do feel alone cause a lot of this stuff drives me crazy.     Just needed to type this out &gt;\_\_\_&lt;  blah.
