850c434c060dd3e8f9f865b9ea80488c00999e6daece53210e778dc7e7e61979;;;Met a girl online that has ADHD and I don't know if she's hinting me to leave or genuinely has that hard of a time focusing;;;Girl I met online (24f) and me (25m) have been talking with each other for about 2 month or so via online communication. She's mentioned that she has ADHD and is scattered a lot of the time. Things were pretty good for the first little while where we really got to know each other. I've mentioned that we should do a video call which see seemed happy to agree to. That happened about a week and a half ago and every single time I've tried to get one going she's either in a bad mood, playing Minecraft with her friends, or fell asleep.   I've tried getting her to commit to a time to do one but she conditioned it by having me play minecraft with her. So I bought the game and am willing to play with her and asked her about committing to a time to which just doesn't respond despite actively talking with her friends. That just makes me feel awful because I feel ignored. I've gone out of my way to buy the game despite not really wanting to until I've already chatted with her first and she just doesn't seem to acknowledge the effort I'm putting in here without any on her end.   I'm frustrated but I don't want to express this frustration to her because I'd like to work things out. But all she wants to do is play minecraft, talk about minecraft, it's everything she watches on youtube. If she does respond then it's just related to the game and her times with her friends. She says she is interested but then does absolutely nothing to work with me. She doesn't take any interest in me or my hobbies. I'll send her videos or memes like she does me and she just ignores them.  I just don't know what to do and I'm open to advice before I send her a frustrated message.
