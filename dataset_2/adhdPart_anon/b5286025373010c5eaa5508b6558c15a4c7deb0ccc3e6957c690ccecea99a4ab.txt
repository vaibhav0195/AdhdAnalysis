b5286025373010c5eaa5508b6558c15a4c7deb0ccc3e6957c690ccecea99a4ab;;;Advice on a partner with (possibly) ADHD;;;Hello everyone!  Me and my boyfriend have been together for a few years and we've had quite some problems due to his behavior. I will give a few examples to give an idea: * he is very easily distracted - we are having a conversation and out of nowhere he will take his phone and start doing something on it. Or more often than not I will ask him to check something on his phone, he will pick it up, get distracted with something else, then will leave the phone. I will ask him if he checked and he will make a remark that he forgot and will have to check again. * he forgets a lot - conversations, events or details in events that are important to me and easy to remember, he just forgets  * he talks a lot and interrupts, even when I have asked him to let me finish before he starts talking * he is very impulsive - he wants to do something and the moment he is doing that he already wants to start something else  * he has made quite a few stupid mistakes in our relationship, as he does things impulsively and does not consider the consequences in advance; he just does what comes to mind without thinking too much and regrets later  * he gets frustrated very easily; a long queue at the store can annoy him; he snaps at me or gets absolutely mad for things that are not my fault (It's his most of the time) and a little while after it's like nothing ever happened and it's me who is left hurt and he can't understand why  * he is not good with his money - spends a lot impulsively and barely saves any * he can't prioritise - most of the time insignificant things are his priority, when he is at an age in which there are other way more important things that need to be prioritised  * he has the need to be praised for normal things, that anyone on his place will be able to do, in order to stay motivated * he loses motivation, especially when it comes to something that's not enjoyable, but it's important  * at times he has 2 moods - either super hyper and full of energy, or he can lie down and fall asleep within 5 seconds  There is probably more to it, but that's mostly what I could think of right now. As a result of this behavior I feel neglected and underappreciated, while he swears up and down he puts a lot of effort, but I just can't see that. I also feel like a patent who has to constantly demand and remind, which is not pleasant for neither of us. He has been diagnosed with ADD as a child, but his family did not take that seriously and has done nothing about it.  Does this sound like adhd?  Any input or advice is welcome!
