f95bab99f0bc7dca3eef411266483e22e76d13fc2b02a102c401b9ec855f7749;;;My story;;;First of all, english is not my first language and im typing on my phone. So sorry for any misspelling.  I have been together with my wife for 16 years. She was diagnosed with adhd as a child and again as an adult. She has struggles with anxiety and depression aswell.   To be honest i dont know what to write here, i just feel so exhausted, frustrated and depressed.  We just had another fight, or she had a fight and i again had to find the strenght to not fight back. My expirience is thats its better to just accept the verbal beating without argument. That way she calms down more quickly.   I do what i can to keep her happy. I do most of the chores around the house and i spend time with our two kids. I rubb her feet and massage her several times per week. I really love my wife, but hate what she somethimes turn into.   For me the worst part is, that i feel alone in the marriage. I miss attention and sex. She is just not interested. I feel lost and alone in the marriage.   Recently she started medication, and i was hopefull. It made her breakdowns less often. But seems like she moved even further away from me.  Often when she has a breakdown she threatens to end the marriage and it used to hurt me, but now im almost in a place where i dont care. Exept for our children.   I guess what hurts the most is her lack of intrest in me and our marriage. And i cant really be angry either because she has adhd.   Sorry for all this rambling.
