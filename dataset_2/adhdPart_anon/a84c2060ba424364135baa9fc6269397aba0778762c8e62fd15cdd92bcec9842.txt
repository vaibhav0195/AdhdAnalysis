a84c2060ba424364135baa9fc6269397aba0778762c8e62fd15cdd92bcec9842;;;Frustrated;;;Some advice please. Argh. I’m finding my partner’s inability to filter really difficult atm. He walked into a room full of our friends and saw me from behind and said “Whose bum is THAT?!”   And then absolutely couldn’t understand why I felt objectified (and also did he even know it was me?).   He also says he wants to go to sex clubs so he can see me sleep with other guys. We’ve only been dating 18 months.  When my friend met him the other day she asked how we’d met and he said “Oh, a friend introduced us cos she thought we’d both like sex. And then I realised she has a nice personality”   He also told me three weeks after we started sleeping together, while we were lying in bed after a nice night together, that he was in love with his ex. And also said I can’t meet one of his best friends as she is in love with him. Still haven’t met her after 18 months...  He says he loves me but I don’t feel loved. Am I being taken for a ride or is this just normal adhd behaviour?
