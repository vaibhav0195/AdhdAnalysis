I’m with someone that has a problem.  Even though I’ve known something was wrong for years, it’s hitting me hard.  Can we make it?  Will he ever get help?  Can my suffering end?  Can his?  The road ahead feels even longer since making this discovery.

Yes he plays with our child and engages with them, yes he’ll do home projects, yes he’ll cook and watch movies, yes he’ll take care of his job stuff but when it comes to free time...gaming, iPad, phone, tv and sometimes all at the same time.  He doesn’t suggest going out.  When I suggest an activity outside of the home he winces.  Sometimes we can even get into heated arguments about this.  For a while now I will just grab our kid and go out without him rather than miss events and be mad or resentful.  I can honor what he likes to do and sometimes he’ll join but what gives?    Do any of you experience this?  He doesn’t talk (deep emotional talks) or complain much but I know he sleeps poorly so maybe energy has something to do with it.  He has also mentioned that he may have a touch of ptsd from his time in the service.    I just want to be like honey, life is good I’m happy our kid is happy let’s go out and see so in so or go to  ___ but he’s just not enthused.  It doesn’t help that we live in an area where there’s always fun stuff to do.  He’s just cool being home.
