ed34326047eefc5d70eaa8633e7caeb660a2ae60e88dbd031c06494843a4b942;;;Calling out to you!;;;So frustrated!  Extremely overtaxed, dutied, FT working mom of 3- three activity teens.   late dx’d 6mos ago - cuz I’ve it my breaking point.  I get maybe 4hrs face to face time with my husband.  Who could give a shit that I’ve figured out what’s wrong with me. He’s never asked or expressed an interest in learning why.  He thinks all our troubles would go away if we only exercised.  He says he’s tired of hearing the ADHD word.

Husband and I of 21 years have been unraveling for quite sometime.  We are both independent and I take a lot of blame for my situation.  You see I’m a people pleaser caregiver- don’t want to rock the boat type of gal.  I’ve never been the type of wife that says no you can’t do this or that.  It’s been known between us that I’ve had some depression since day 2.   In fact, I was unmedicated until our 2 child (first two are 21 mos apart) and the lack of sleep was aggravating it.  My husband makes a great salary to afford a very comfortable lifestyle.  I worked part-time at a lesser job to have something to do out of the house, to add good benefits and bring in a little fun $.  My husbands job is in basically “sales”.  And he’s never been a 9-5’ver.  He could be home in town all day, not come home til 8 pm or 11pm or be overnight somewhere.   I just took care of EVERYTHING because I am who I am and that was the job that gave us our life.   Everything means supplies for all family members and everything you need to run a household of 5 people &amp; 3 pets!  Appts, paying the bills you name it! My job turned into full-time 5 years ago and now we have 3 teens 13 to 17 that are involved all year round in a minimum of 3 activities/sports/clubs etc.   I’ve hit my tipping point.  Started therapy 13 mos ago, and am now on medication for depression, adhd, anxiety &amp; panic attacks!   I’m on my 5th week of short- term disability!!!    I’m a very emotional person and my husband is now a bulldozer that believes in “working it” til it’s done.  Which doesn’t bode well for our conversations.  In fact, I try to avoid because of how it usually makes me end up feeling.    Tomorrow we’ll be in the gym all day attending a child’s sports tournament.    He has asked me if I want to attend an NFL game this Sunday.  I don’t understand or really care about football but it’s in another city and we’d fly on a personal plane with friends of ours and meet others there.  The only reason I’m intrigued is because this stadium is supposed to be pretty cool.   But I’m worried that I’ll end up feeling offended by something he’s said or will do and it’ll be a bad day.   Wondering if  we’re expecting too much?   We’ll be with at least a group of 8 but I’d have to be careful to not tear up over anything said - or it might “reflect on his pride” (is how I feel).    But if I tell him I don’t want to go - that’s not going to look good either.   And I’m guessing with all my meds I better not drink 😏.  Not that I usually do.
