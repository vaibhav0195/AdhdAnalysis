500a2c7fb70ade0359b323f078cfbdf96f1904bf5f3ff285382c02f79cedfb10;;;Quick (and hopefully simple) question;;;ADHD and anxiety are comorbid. If you have ADHD, you're more likely to also be diagnosed with anxiety, correct?  On to the real question: Does that work in reverse? Are people with anxiety also more likely to have ADHD? And would knowing someone has a family history of anxiety (but no diagnosis, positive or negative, themselves) be useful in diagnosing them with ADHD?

Should I try asking college students for pills? If so, how?**  Edited for clarity.  Ok, here's the long version: I've recently obtained an official diagnosis of ADD. I've known for a while, if that makes sense - three high school teachers and a college prof went to my parents asking that I be tested, and a family member who is a child psychologist has been urging me to get a diagnosed for over a decade.  Anyway, I went to do this because due to life changes (baby, promotion), I cannot hold it together anymore. The behavioral modifications that helped me in the past aren't sustainable right now. The diagnosing psychologist recommended medication.  I would probably have never risked the expense of the evaluation if things hadn't gotten really bad. I am not, repeat NOT, functioning as an adult right now. I can take care of the baby (because god forbid that I should screw that up), but concentrating so hard and so long to stay steady with her is making my work suffer, and I can't manage anything else in life. I'll go three or four days in a row without eating at home or showering. To clarify, I am not depressed, just so distractable right now that it's taken me 3 hours to write this post. It's bad.  Anyway, the diagnosing psychologist can't prescribe medication. He's working with my general practitioner. SHE can't get me in for a visit for a month! I feel like I need help right away. Is it stupid or short-sighted of me to consider purchasing black-market prescriptions to get through the wait? I have no idea how to go about it, either. Can anyone advise me?

adcb5ff6ff544436fdc71e767fb0fb0f6070ef00050d918dab144f227bbc6be5;;;20 mg vyvanse makes me feel "high" and causes muscle tension? ;;;I'm Inattentive not hyperactive, and i am taking the lowest dose of 20 mg Vyvanse. It causes my mood to lift, I become very talkative and chatty, and I focus singlemindedly on one task as intended.   I only take the meds like once a week, organize my life, study the weeks worth of material, then I continue the rest of the week unmedicated, building off of the foundations i built on the on-med days. I prefer this because i feel I am more creative off meds - random thoughts occur to me and they often lead to good ideas.  I'm concerned about this "high", it is very pleasurable and lasts all day and i find myself wanting to take meds even on days when i don't need to focus on anything - i resist the temptation of course but it makes me wonder if my dose is too high, that I should get cravings for it.  I am also concerned because it gives me muscle pain the next day...i think it might drain my electrolytes because it makes me pee a lot. As you can see i have a very low tolerance -i get the appetite loss and dry mouth too.  I've tried lowering my dose by breaking the capsule in water and drinking half of it (10mg). Problem is, if i do this, I can't focus for as many hours as I like...it takes three hours to hit and wears off in another three hours. The full dose lasts eight hours.  I am afraid of splitting the doses into two parts morning and evening because i have enough trouble sleeping without stimulants lingering in my blood.  My doctor says everything seems to be fine...personally I'd like it to be any better. Does anyone have any suggestions to improve this situation, or any experience with the pleasurable high or muscle pain?

I don't necessarily feel it's very nice to point out people's symptoms/faults. Should I just tell her? How? Or should I not? She seems to be doing fine except for the studying problems.  She has constantly rejected my attempts to befriend her so my plan to subtly introduce it to her by getting to know her have pretty much failed.  Have you had any positive experiences telling people about their potential adhd? I've told several people in the past and I don't think it's been helpful to them.

Last year my diet was terrible.. I worked at a snack bar and I ate cotton candy and drank red bull. I also smoked plenty of newports. after another health issue came up, I changed my diet completely, no sugar intake not even fruits. No white flour, no dairy, only veggies, millet grain, eggs, fish.  I've never been tested for ADD .. i think i have it after what i read I can't tell if I was just a kid and had it, or if I was just a regular kid.. I can't really say for sure when it started.. Nobody ever caught on that I had ADD to this day I haven't told my parents.. I've told one of my co-workers but he doesn't really know the signs of ADD..  * I'm 17 - but I act like an idiot / say stupid shit at times * I can't multi-task for nothing * Huge procrastinator.. * my attention span is terrible * terrible social anxiety.. very few friends. * I constantly moving my legs or hands.  Someone could be talking to me and I'll completely block what their saying If I even look away for a second. Or I could be looking straight at their face and only focus on their teeth and not what they got to say.  Allot of times I'll start listening to what they have to say, reply, then they speak, and I completely didn't listen. -- Because of my other health problem which cost my family 2 weeks of hospital costs with no insur I can't afford to get tested and prescribed pills... I really wana go on a diet to treat ADD but not sure where to start.. I guess getting rid of stimulants would be great. I think I've done a good job at that. No sugar intake for the last 9 months.   I smoke weed, but idk.. the experience for some reason has changed from good to bad.... I used to smoke all the time and I really enjoyed it.. now I get pretty depressed.. I'm already depressed as it is. weed gets me to the point where I feel like shit. I can't concentrate while high either, so I doubt mary is good for treating ADD...  at least in my case..   --  **tl;dr** - I think I have ADD - can't afford meds/doctor visits - want to treat ADD holistically. I'm not sure if i have ADD or ADHD.  I think the latter..

Some people I know have actually been tested (TOVA or some form of CPT), but most often it's been a shrink/doctor asking them questions.  And then once medicated (or whatever), the measurement is also squishy (you feel better or worse), hard to quantify how how it's impacting you.  I just found out about PEBL, an open-source system for creating psych tests, including ones used for ADD like TOVA and Connor's CPT-II.  The downside is you won't get the norms and the indexes that are part of the process when take the official tests.  On the other hand, you can take the tests as often as you want and get data on your own performance unmedicated vs. medicated (and different levels/meds).  Some of you might find it very interesting, check it out.  ETA: http://pebl.sourceforge.net/

Ask me anything.;;;I am now on 36mg tabs of concerta and have been for eight months.  I was raised by a psychologist mother who dealt with me incredibly well and showed me I do not need the drugs.  I was first diagnosed when I was 8 years old. They have improved the quality of my life greatly though and I made the right decision to begin taking concerta- but I made the decision as an adult- my parents chose to let me decide for myself and when I turned 18 I chose not to take drugs.  Only now (22) have I decided that for my last year and a half of university I should test the medication out.  Ask me anything you like and I will do my best to help.

Also, both my parents are adhd.  Anyways, I have basically all the symptoms of adhd/add, from the random depression, racing thoughts, hyperfocus, trouble focusing, *horrible* memory, cluttered/messy, super sensitive, low self-esteem, random anger bursts, talking to much, and the list goes on.   Getting off track here, okay, so I'm in my second year of college and I didn't do too fantastic my second semester.  So I'm looking for help on how to stay focus when I'm trying to study. And no, I don't want medication. I believe that you can harness the power of adhd/add and use it to make yourself better.   So, how do I study and not be bored out of my mind? How can I focus??  Thank you!

Looking for Advice, Experiences etc. (X-post from r/ADD);;;I was diagnosed with ADD when I was seven or eight years old. When I was thirteen my mother decided that I didn't need medication any longer. I'm thirty three now and, partially because of this [webcomic](http://raisedonritalincomic.blogspot.com/) I read the other day, I realized that I've been plagued with the symptoms of ADD my whole life. I freaked out when it first occurred to me because all I could think about was the entirety of my adult life under the thumb of these symptoms. After about ten minutes of being extremely angry and scared I started doing research and looking for recommendations for psychiatrists/psychologists. I'm going to an Adult ADD group and a therapist on Monday (therapist who was recommended by my friend's therapist). Part of me just sort of wants to find a doctor who will give me a prescription so I can hurry up and get on with making the changes I want to make but I know that this is going to be a process. I guess I'm just looking for suggestions as far as making this as inexpensive as possible. I'm not opposed to working with someone and learning how to manage my time more effectively without medication but, from some of the posts and comments here, I gather I might just be spinning my wheels without them. I think I'm taking the right steps but I don't really have anyone to consult with at the moment (well, until tomorrow, I guess).

(x/post from ADD);;;24F female, diagnosed ADD at a young age was on ritalin for 6 years and it had absolutely no effect whatsoever.Took myself off it and never looked back kinda just coped. However recently it was revealed to me that my ADD might more far reaching than I ever thought possible... specifically with my sex life.  Now to be fair I got the grab bag when it comes to things that could effect sex. ADD, hashimotos thyroiditis, history of anxiety and depression, was morbidly obese most of my teenage and adult life. So who knows what it really is.  My friend who is a mostly inattentive type is married to a mostly hyperactive type we got to talk and alot of the problems I have are things she and he have felt and felt some relief from while on adderall.   Some things I suffer from : Not being able to focus during sex. Not even joking here I can't even masturbate without needing a song stuck in my head.    Only getting wet with new people. This has made for a lot of impulsive jumping in and out of relationships and making mistakes. I love my current boyfriend to death and I get aroused by him in everything but the physical lubrication response. I attribute this to the low arousal theory thing. I only really feel alive at big one time events i.e. concerts/raves.  My brother had good luck with adderall and I got to try some for two weeks through a friend and it seemed to help.  My questions would be along the lines of... does anyone else have or has had lubrication issues? Did your sex life get better?  I guess in the end I'm just hoping for some advice or at least to know I'm not alone in these type of problems and that medication for ADHD may offer some relief.  Got an appt with a new GP to start the process of getting on medication.

This semester I'm taking a required, 8-week English course in which we are required to read 5 novels. The reading assignments end up being about 50 pages per day. Yesterday was the first time in my life that I was able to read that much in one sitting, and I was so proud. However, today I realized that I only absorbed about 5% of it.   I've always had poor reading comprehension of lengthy content, but in every other class I've always found other ways to learn the material. I don't know what to do in this class because the only way to learn the material is done so in a way that I cannot.   Help??

1404183b9af735699e6ddcb342b910d943c6b9df8964cbc7ce9569b3e7734b8c;;;Think I May Have ADD/ADHD... (27 years old);;;I have already booked an appointment with my doctor about it for tomorrow and am starting down the path to take a look at diagnosis and possible treatment if it is, in fact, what I believe it is.  I started thinking I might have it, oddly enough, while reading r/drugs and reading their AMA series on Amphetamines.  I was interested in what the effects were and then, I think someone made a comment about different reactions to Amphetamines like Adderall if you have ADD.  I decided to google and find out what exactly the symptoms of ADD/ADHD was, having been misinformed all my life.    For the longest time I was under the impression that people with ADD/ADHD were just hyper, off the wall trouble making types.  So imagine my surprise when I started reading down the list of symptoms and found huge correlations to my issues, which I just though boiled down to laziness, etc.  My story is basically this; at a young age, I was identified as a gifted kid.  In grade 3, I'd leave my classroom for about an hour, twice a week, and do fun "problem solving" type problems.  Eventually, they recommended I enter a gifted program for Grade 4.  I stuggled a bit but, for the most part, enjoyed that year, besides the stress of changing schools and suddenly being friendless in a new school.  The next year, we moved to another city.  I spent the first two months in a normal 5th Grade class but then was quickly invited to a gifted program in this city.  It was great up until around the end of Grade 6 and starting of Grade 7 when the homework and assignments started to pile up.  Previous to this, I was able to pick most of the work I wanted to focus on (writing stories, etc) and it wasn't a problem.  Suddenly, I found myself unable to complete homework and assignments.  My teacher and my parents were both exasperated trying to get me to focus on getting the assignments complete and I was getting rather depressed myself.  But whenever I sat down to work on homework, I would always end up sitting there feeling this torturous feeling until I just would give up, after barely starting, and do something else.  It wasn't like the work was even difficult, it was just so boring.  My parents and I seemed to have the same thoughts on the potential of ADD/ADHD and how it couldn't be my problem because I wasn't 'hyper' and I had no trouble concentrating on some things. (Namely video games, some novels, TV, etc)  High school was even more of a train-wreck.  I was recommended not to continue in the gifted program for high school (imagine the blow to my already crappy self-esteem) and ended up in a new school with no friends, once again.  I would coast through my high school career with frustrated teachers.  I would listen to all the lessons but never take notes, even when I would get in trouble for not doing so.  I just couldn't force myself to take them.  I would answer questions in class and would understand all the subject matter but I'd never do homework.  My school marks were all in the 50s to low 70s because I would only complete tests and exams (which I got 90s on).  It was frustrating.  It continues to this day, though in less stressful ways, thank goodness.  Whenever the home starts to get messy, and the wife starts to nag about getting housework down and working on projects around the home, I get stressed out and angry at her.  I always tell her to "give me a few minutes to relax!" and get easily side-tracked when working on them.  Even though I know it'd be just easier to get things done and then focus on what I'd like to do, I just have such a hard time doing so.  The **TL:DR** of it is basically this; Didn't consider ADD/ADHD to be my problem, just laziness, until I just recently read the symptoms and realized that you don't have to be bouncing-off-the-wall-hyper and that hyperfocus is, paradoxically, a symptom of it.  I do realize that I still might not have it, which is why I look forward to finding out for sure.  Especially since the huge impact it could have had on my life.  **Couple of quick questions for diagnosed sufferers**  1.  Do you ever have this "foggy" feeling, as if you can't really think as well as you feel you should be able to?  It's hard for me to describe besides feeling like I have some sort of "brain fog".  2.  Are you at all a low energy type of person?  I have always been someone who is more sedentary or low energy.  I do things like constantly blab someone's ear off or tap my foot but if I told people I thought I had ADD/ADHD, I'm sure they'd bring up how low energy I am as a counter-point.  3.  Not a question but please, I'd appreciate people who have been diagnosed with ADD/ADHD to fire me a personal message, I wouldn't mind learning a little more about what it has been like.  4.  Finally, any links to non-medication related strategies for making dealing with things easier?  Thanks a ton, in advance.

I have been diagnosed in the past with GAD and depression, I also suffered from some other issues which was being narrowed down to either bipolar disorder (mother is diagnosed) or adult ADD. I was on Straterra for a brief time, but my insurance ran out and so did my pills. The more stress I was under, the worse things got.  I went into a hole of depression due to being laid off, went through many different symptoms of either ADD or bipolar disorder and while some of it was beneficial, other times it was not. I would focus hard on learning new things, but got really distracted. I work in information security and the time I had while being laid off and hyper stressed helped me get this career. Stressors are piling up and the symptoms have started flaring. I have suddenly been asked to increase my responsibility at work and I have a significant workload now. As more work gets piled on, the more I get stressed, the less work I do. I have a lot of anxiety writing this post right now thinking about it all.  Now that I'm thinking of this, it may be an anxiety thing. I freeze in the face of stress.  I have no idea what to do. I am having a very difficult time settling on a doctor. I stare at the screen for my insurance company, unable to make a phone call because I have no data on these people or my options. Then I fall into the trap of Googling these people to learn more and then somehow end up on Reddit again...  This is at a boiling point. I have a very important report for a client due today, as well as recertifiying my entire company for a program and a bunch of testing for clients. I am going to fail at a few of these tasks today and I face consequences.  I have taken adderall recreationally in the last few months, but I was hung over and sleep deprived, so I couldn't quite feel the effects.  Does anyone have any good input for me? I live in the greater Orlando area, if anyone can recommend a doctor, I'd appreciate that as well.  edit: felt compelled to edit this to include that my experiences echo most of the "do I have ADD" threads or experience threads. Gifted child, no motivation "He could succeed if he tried". I am a very smart person, but I have a difficult time succeeding in life.

(x-post from /r/narcolepsy);;;For the past several years (I'm in high school) I've always had trouble staying awake during my school days and even at home some times. To me, I was normal, because I know everyone falls asleep at school. But the thing is I recently experienced sleep paralysis for the first time, and this lead me to look at Narcolepsy as a possibility. Does Narcolepsy ever group with AD/HD? I was diagnosed with depression but that diagnosis was, to me, incorrect and it now looks like AD/HD to me, but as I stated above, the symptoms for Narcolepsy have made themselves clear and I'm just not really sure what to think. If it matters my AD/HD (if that's really it) symptoms have had to do with inattention, inability to focus on a topic which leads me to trouble grasping concepts and therefore academic failure, and the inability to be still or be inactive to some extent. All of this, coupled with my falling asleep at inappropriate times, have just made my grades, and mood, drop. Please help, reddit. What are your thoughts?

I now have a new set of  questions. I am highly enjoying how productive and focused i have been but I have a worry that I might build a tolerance too this. So I have 3 questions! 1. How long before my body begins to adapt and build a tolerance? 2. How do I prevent my body from building the tolerance? and 3. If I do build a tolerance how do I basically reset?

Shrugged off homework, ditched plans with friends, etc. My parents and teachers always attributed it to my intelligence, and as they were essentially calling me smart, I went with it.  But, in recent years, I've started to suspect it was ADHD. I've had problems with several drugs, all of which I ended up just walking away from for a new crutch. My mind never stops moving, even when I'm trying to sleep. It also just kind of wanders, often pondering random things that nobody would ever care about, but which amused me in the moment. I haven't been able to hold a job for long, and whenever I get paid, I tend to spend it on shit I don't need; I just say fuck it and buy stuff. I'm divorced at 22, and none of my other relationships have lasted long.  Anyways, I ramble. I'm going in to get it diagnosed Monday morning, and while I'll let the doctors worry about whether I have it or not, my question is, did you feel any different after starting treatment? Like, did you look at things differently, or have a different thought process or anything?

I was diagnosed last week.  Today,  energetic yet relaxed,  I feel like I want to do things but I am not anxious if I don't.  I have dry mouth and I still am getting distracted but I don't have the resistance to the tasks that used to take so much wasted energy. I feel like this: http://www.roswellpaintingcontractor.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/man_relieved1.jpg_opt1.jpg  I have another appointment with my doctor in a week,  but util then:  So,  in the next few days what should I look for to make sure I'm taking the right dose?  I still am getting distracted a lot,  does that improve over the long term? What happens if i decide to not take them this weekend?  Any warning signs I should look for?  Also, how long does the effects last in the day?  Thank you for any advice or experiences you share.

I had no answer.. I guess I don't feel like I could really share my life with someone without scaring them off? I can't even come up with a reason!  I would like to find a partner to share my life with, but I somehow feel unable.   Anyone out there experienced this?

[Norway];;;Now, a bit about my back-story just to cover that: After several visit to the doctor and even an MRI for my pounding tension migraine that's lasted for years, they finally decided to check me for ADD. The results from all the tests are positive, and there's also a lot of things about my growing up that fits pretty much all the signs and symptoms.  So now, at 21, i'm finally seeing a psychologist specialized in ADD/ADHD. But, the thing is: The state (or "statan", as it's commonly called here) has noticed that there are people who sell their medication on the black market, and thus pretty much refuse to give it to adults. I find this extremely unfair, seeing how i have no contact with crime, do no drugs, no tobacco, and even no alcohol.  What they do instead is suggest ways to try and cope with it, but that will take a while and they're not even sure if i'll be able to read a book again. All they can try to do is to reduce my suffering.  So, /r/ADHD, my questions to you: How can this possibly be a good solution? What are your opinions on this? Is it neglect from the health department? (I for one find it incredibly sad that otherwise healthy drugfree youth with their whole lives ahead of them, are refused medicine and a chance to function normally like this.)  (Edit: Another thing that saddens me about it, is that doctors suggested anti depressants for me a bunch of times - but when it's clear what it is i'm being refused any medication. How can they write out anti depressants like it's candy but restrict proper medicine?)
b2a7c56cdfe1058e08c8e252743e6fad60e02b632acb80e29cae7c2d411c9339;;;Went off strattera because of price, just taking Adderall (generic). Not sure its working alone... Advice?;;;I was on 60mg of Strattera and 20mg of Adderall daily, for the past 9 years with a little up-dosing or down dosing over that period of time but pretty regular.  I have weird insurance. I pay full price for prescriptions but then my work will reimburse me for 50%.  The strattera (no generic available) was close to $200/mo. The adderall (generic) $35. I am at a particularly tight point financially (story of my life) and decided to just not get Strattera for a couple months. The first couple of weeks off it was haaarrddd... I wanted to just die. But I knew that was going to happen and I fought very hard through the intense feelings of hopelessness. I still struggle but not as bad, normal, I have always had depression but treating the ADD has treated the depression (for the most part). It has been almost 2 months now taking only Adderall.  I am struggling at work. It is really hard to get through the day. In the morning I do my usual sprint through tasks. I have a very good job, very creative type thing, a lot of responsibility and flexibility. I feel lately like I am slowing down and I am definitely having a hard time focusing. My house is a mess. It is the messiest its been in a while. I feel like I am letting everyone down around me.  Do I get back on Strattera and just deal with the cost? Do I up my Adderall dosage? Is there other, cheaper drugs to try?  Any advice is appreciated. I feel like I am pretty much on my own when it comes to bringing this info to my doctor. Since being diagnosed 9 years ago, she pretty much just stuck with my original doctors recommendations and lets me decide if it needs adjustment based on how I feel. She is a family doctor &amp; gynecologist, and I do not get the impression she is entirely up on psychiatric drugs (don't get me wrong, she is otherwise a really good doctor). I just can't go to her with "I dont know what to do but I need to do something" I need to saying something more proactive like "I think it would be good if I take XX dose and possibly switch to BLABLA drug, what do you think?"  But I am at a loss, since I have been doing the same thing for 9 years I do not even know if there might be something better for me I am missing out on.

I have been struggling, but have made it through college and ~5 years of work without getting fired.  Until today.    I had a new job in finance for about a month (I narrowly escaped getting fired from the last job).  I know, deep down, it's probably for the best because the #1 requirement for accountants/financial analysts is attention to detail.  I will try not to bore you with too many details about why this makes me feel like a terrible failure, but the bottom line is that I no longer have an income and just signed a 12 month lease in a new city (where I relocated for work).  I am not sure what type of advice it is that I am looking for, but I'm just trying to figure out what to do next.  It seems clear that corporate finance is not the right field for me (or anyone with ADD), but I don't know how I'm supposed to survive out here.  I'm 29 years old and sometimes I just feel like a child that can't get himself together.  I genuinely tried checking my work to the best of my ability every time, but I still made mistakes, which led to me being let go today.  Can anyone give some helpful advice?  I want to be successful in life and I'm no longer sure how to do it.  If you've read this far, I would just like to genuinely say "thank you" from one internet stranger to another.  Also, if there is a better place for this post just let me know and I'll x-post it.
8898a0b11f79145906453590098d19002ce83b51fe03ce3ff29c78881d8c9ed3;;;Am I depressed because I have ADHD, or is my lack of focus just because of depression? (x-posted from r/depression;;;I was diagnosed as having depression at 16, and have been on 5 different SSRIs over the last 4 years. I always wind up quitting them because although they do work to make me less depressed, they also make me less....everything. They make me feel like an emotionless robot/zombie that could not be brought to give a shit about anything.  Most of the SSRIs also made me feel sluggish, tired, and unfocused. I know lack of motivation, sleep problems, fatigue, etc. are symptoms of depression, but the SSRIs only made these worse, while numbing me emotionally. Nowadays, I feel like these physical symptoms are what hurt me the most.  I was a decent student through most of grade school, with parents I didn't dare disobey or disappoint (mostly scared of my dad's wrath). So maybe that's why I wasn't considered to have ADD/ADHD. But now the signs and symptoms seem very apparent to me:  I can't focus. At all. It's like my mind is running too fast for what I'm doing. I start reading some text, and before I know it, I'm skimming. I start watching a movie or TV program, and next thing you know, I'm on my cell phone or in the kitchen wondering what there is to eat. This is what's killing me in school.  I'm always tense/wound up/restless. This is one thing I've never noticed myself, but people always comment on. I'm always tapping my foot or clicking my pen or drumming my fingers on the table. If someone tries to get my attention, the response will be less like, "oh, hi, what's up?" and more "YEAHWHAT?" (not so much angrily, but more in a snap-my-head-around-and-answer-before-they-even-finished-their-sentence kind of way).  I cannot be organized. I cannot finish a task after I've started it. I have problems getting started on anything that I know will require more than 30 sec. of work or attention.  These are just a few examples of the 'symptoms' that lead me to believe I may suffer from a tad of the ol' ADHD. I get frustrated with my inability to focus or accomplish things I am otherwise perfectly capable of. I get down on myself, and then I go, "oh, geez, I'm worthless/depressed/a failure, etc." And that's where the 'depression' comes from. I can't keep friendships, because it's hard for me to plan outings, be motivated to do anything in the first place that would require more than 5 min. of driving, or calm myself down enough to make myself easy to be around (no one likes to be around a shaky, volatile, tense, fidgety person). This also depresses me.  TL;DR - I think my depression symptoms may actually be more an effect caused by ADHD, and not the other way around.  Thanks for reading, your thoughts and insight would be greatly appreciated.  (Edit: Spaced out the text.)

If you have any suggestions for that content, or any other improvements you'd like to see in /r/ADHD, reply to this post!**  **EDIT: update as of saturday oct. 1st: have the FAQ about half-written, just been busy with schoolwork, etc.**  Hey all,  Since the previous mods of /r/ADHD had been inactive for a year, I submitted a request to take it over, and I've been approved!   The reason I wanted to do this is mainly because I felt the main page isn't living up to its potential. I want to compile a lot of useful information to link in the sidebar, so that all the "I think I might have ADHD" posters have a list of high-quality information to start with. I'd like to see this subreddit be both a supportive community and a hub of reliable information.   My approach to ADHD is one that's fairly scientific and pro-medication. I haven't yet mentally ironed out what my policies will be, but right now I think it will be like this: I may control what links go in the sidebar, but I don't downvote people with whom I disagree. (I might speak out against your ideas in a public reply, though!) As moderator, I have no plans on tampering with anyone's posts or comments, unless you're spreading misinformation to a dangerous degree, or otherwise being a dick. Standard reddit code of conduct will apply, and I'm sure I don't have to explain that.  A note about merging with /r/ADD, because I know people will be asking: my answer is, I don't know how or if that works, but I'll talk to /r/ADD's mods and we'll see what we can find out. I'll update you when I have more to report.  I'm reasonably busy, and this is also my first time moderating on reddit, so I'll have to ask you to bear with me, especially at first, while I get the hang of things and roll out my planned improvements for this subreddit as I'm able.  Having said all that, feel free to start commenting on this post with ideas for what you think should go into our FAQ, list of helpful links, books, etc.! And if you don't mind, upvote this so more people see it!  Thanks everyone.

She said she normally prescribes Adderall, but, due to the shortage, temporarily stopped. I've heard lots of bad things about Ritalin, and I'm nervous to start it. I meet with her again in a month and might ask about Adderall or Vyvanse due to health reasons. Should I be worried about taking Ritalin until then? I'm 18, active, very healthy, and on no other medications other than Flonase

Share your experiences..;;;Since I have insurance now, I will be visiting a doctor or going strait to a psyciatrist to explain that I may have ADHD after researching about symptoms and comparing to my own experiences.  How will they diagnose me? Questions? Physical tests?  Will it take more than one visit? If so, how many?  I have read many other posts where people go to get diagnosed for ADHD and leave with a diagnosis for depression, or other conditions. How often does this happen? Did it happen to you?  If you're comfortable sharing, what was your experience with becoming diagnosed?  Thanks..
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;r/ADHD, do you have any other developmental/learning disorders, and how have you learned to cope with it all?;;;Just wondering. I got diagnosed a few months ago with ADHD predominantly inattentive and an NLD, or nonverbal learning disorder. I was doing some research yesterday after taking my first dose of Concerta when I realized how many of these behavioral quirks I've developed to deal with my problems. For example:  - I talk to myself whenever I'm under duress. The NLD means I process everything through words, and since kids with ADHD tend to be bad at 'self-talk', I've learned to literally stop and force myself to explain to myself what's happening.  - I fidget all the fucking time (air guitar/piano/drums, picking at my hair, pacing, organizing things, etc). It's not because I have the hyperactivity thing going on; it's because doing something else that doesn't require a lot of brainpower stops my brain from running off on me. This also means people often think I'm ignoring them when I'm really trying my best to focus by doing something else while they talk.  Do you have any quirks that are explained by your ADHD or any other learning disorder?

What are reasonable expectations?;;;I'm just starting to work with a psychiatrist again for ADHD. This time, the medication we started with is a lot better than what I took when I tried this years ago, so I think I'm on the right track.  At the same time, I'm not all the way there I think. I can focus on 75% of the lecture instead of 40%. I used to average 30 minutes of work for every 1 hour browsing the internet. Now it's more like 2 hours work to 45 minutes of browsing.  I'm hoping I can catch all of a lecture and work pretty continuously without getting distracted. Is that too high of expectation?

Any suggestions?;;;Reddit, I have been taking conerta (54mg) for a few months now, works great for me. But there is 1 downside: I really have problems with eating during the day. I have to force myself to cram something in my mouth during lunch. Which makes me feel almost sick from hunger during the day, I know i have to eat, but I just can't. It's like my body won't let me. Does anyone have the same problem, and/or a suggestion on what might help me?
25a03ce3cfdff185513b66bc236357d454166186bd3c8efaba5c31b1e57a5aac;;;What should I expect from meds?;;;I was rediagnosed with ADHD (along with moderate depression) last week by a psychologist, and I'm seeing my doctor again this week to hopefully get a prescription of some sort. The doctor doesn't want to give me Adderall or Riddlin because I've had them as a young child and didn't react to them well.  I'm wondering what a non-stimulant drug will do for me. I'm a full time college student, with several jobs. This semester has kicked me around, a lot. I've come to the point that I really don't care about my schooling at this point. I pretty much failed one course (haven't received my final marks yet), and I've been doing poorly because I just haven't been able to pay attention. Throughout HS and generals in college, I never had to study. Engineering courses seem to require a lot of study, and I just can't do it (not because I'm not intelligent or don't have interest generally).  Will the drugs "magically" help me to focus better, along with some motivation? I'm just so burnt out trying so hard, but one can always try harder, and I am all the more frustrated because of this.

More specifically, where do I start?;;;I (female) was diagnosed with ADD (no hyperactivity) at 17 and I am now 29 and never finished high school. I've had crappy CRAPPY jobs up until now and have decided that I want to finish high school and actually go on to trying university.   I realize that after reading this and /r/ADD is that I will probably need to try meds. I've never had much success with these but to be honest I've never given meds a good try. However, I am still breastfeeding my 18 month old and plan to stop when she is 2 years old. So it will be a full 6 months before I can go that route. Until then I can still work on my single most frustrating problem: Time management.  I'm just not sure where to start. It just seems so incredibly overwhelming. Writing lists is a huge issue for me, I feel so SO stupid having to write out stuff like "Take a shower 9am, do laundry 9:30am, etc.", however I realize that it's stuff like this that is going to help me when I go back to school. Has anyone else felt this way? And if you overcame it, how?  I do plan on more research on this area, but I am looking for advice on a starting point. I think that if I can get the ball rolling, I can move forward with managing my time.
1f6e99c7b20ec83e20629b1f14f37052b6a827721526bf9c68bf7ea1e014e1a4;;;Well, is it? And if so, what next?;;;**TL;DR:**  Pretty sure I have ADHD, wondering what diagnostic steps would confirm it.  Also, would prefer to avoid most of the first-line treatments, wondering if people have experience with other treatments like buspar.  Trying to figure it out.  I've had a lot of problems with focus, procrastination, etc, over the last 3 years (which is when I finally completed school and lived completely on my own for the first time).  They've been compounded by crappy work/life situations which have led to mood issues.  I started seeing a therapist earlier this year for depression/stress, and we've made quite a bit of progress on the situational stuff (my mood is way better) but I'm still having trouble with focus and getting stuff done on time.  I'm high-functioning (graduated from college, did a masters, got a doctorate), so I assumed that I couldn't have done all of that with undiagnosed ADHD.  My brother has a textbook case of ADHD, and compared to him, I've always been "the good student".  But on the other hand, I've often felt slightly scattered (at best), had issues with procrastination/time management, had difficulty waking up, and generally felt like somewhat of an underachiever.  Looking back, I think I just had coping mechanisms that worked pretty well when I had external structure.  Other than symptom review what would be next steps to confirm the diagnosis?  I think if that's it, it might be time for meds, since the childhood coping skills aren't really haven't been helping much any more.  I'd like to avoid stimulants because of the cardiac effects.  I already take a blood pressure med, so I can't take clonidine.  There's a risk of mania with wellbutrin, and that's not good with my family history, plus it can exacerbate anxiety, which I'm prone to.  That leaves strattera, TCAs, or buspar.  My brother takes strattera and says it gives him occasional bad headaches - something I can't risk because I have migraines that are barely kept under control on multiple meds.  Of all the meds, I think the side effect profile of buspar seems the most attractive to me.  Anyone have experience with it?

The list of meds she gave me to choose from consists of:  Adderall, Concerta, Focalin, Intuniv, Kapvay, Strattera, and Wellbutrin as an alternative option.  I've been prescrived to Strattera before, but don't remember whether I liked it or not.  The common side effects for the rest of them make them unappealing, except for Wellbutrin.  I read a little on it and the studies on its use in ADHD is pretty mixed, with the most recent one(that I know of) saying that it was about as effective as placebo.  Has anyone else been prescribed Wellbutrin for ADHD?  If so, what do you think of it?

I am a relatively calm person and I can focus just fine.  It's just that my mind is overflowing with ideas and I feel like I have to share them with people.  My mind races 100% of the time, and I have great difficulty sleeping at night. A friend of mine said that I was "literally a genius" and that they had misdiagnosed me as someone with ADHD because of "the sheer amount of goddamned creative content you put out all the fucking time." I'm open to this possibility, but I don't honestly think I'm a genius. Do you think I have ADHD, Reddit?

Since i tried MDMA i noticed that i should accept that i shouldn't be doing this, its whats causing me to lose focus, I just put too much thought into trying to help myself out of this "ADHD" and puff it vanished. It didn't come back for a couple of days until i started questioning myself again about if the MDMA gave me a temporary effect when i had come under a great deal of stress from an event, But finally i accepted that i shouldn't try so hard and this instantly made me capable of focusing on everything and i know i don't have ADHD anymore.   I'm just letting everyone know that this worked for me. Fucking saved my life.

Advice? ;;;A couple of months ago I began seeing a clinical psychologist about some issues I was having with anxiety. Several sessions later he tells me that he sees a pattern emerging in my stories about issues I struggle with and about my life in general. This pattern, he says, is ADD. He also thinks that it's likely that it went undiagnosed for this long (I'm 28) because I don't have much of the hyperactivity component. I'm in my last year of college and my therapist thinks that going on some medication for ADD might help me keep up with my difficult school / work schedule.   So a few weeks ago my therapist referred me to a psychiatrist to talk about meds since he can't prescribe them himself. The psychiatrist feels my blood pressure is too high to prescribe stimulant meds. He tried Tenex, which is supposed to lower blood pressure as well as treat ADD, but I had really awful side effects from it and stopped taking it after a few days.  I'm just wondering if anyone has any suggestions to do with ADD and high blood pressure. I'm trying to diet and lose weight to see if that helps, but that approach is going to take a lot of time. I'm trying to decide if I should go to my GP and see if he has some suggestion on how to deal with both the ADD and high BP, but I'm at a loss. It seems like no matter what I do I won't be able to get help for the ADD when I need it most.   TL;DR - Psychiatrist won't prescribe Ritalin due to high blood pressure. Advice?

Mainly I end up on facebook, reddit, and news sites. Tonight, I've literally been at my computer for the last 6 hours and gotten nothing done.  I have a 10 page paper that's past due and I haven't gotten past a half a page. I've already outlined everything. And I've got a good idea of where to get all the info I need. But I'm having a shit hard time actually DOING it. This is really rough. I haven't been this bad in a long time. Also, I'm sick with a cold i think, which may have something to do with it.

My wife mentioned at the doctor yesterday that I seem to have anxiety issues but I did not connect the dots to realize it is a separate issue that complicates things just a bit.  also after talking with my sister we realized that anxiety issues run in the family.  So I'm trying to get a feel for how other people deal. I'm not expecting a magic bullet or a medication fix. I do not think my anxiety issues are not something other people have had to deal with. I plan on going to my doctor to address this but I've found that if I go in with an idea of what my issues are the conversation is more of a discussion and less a lecture.   EDIT: I'm going to go see my doctor regarding this. But it is helpful to talk to other people.

I was diagnosed with ADD/ADHD (which may or may not have actually been true) when I was really young. So, like probably many of you guys on here, I spent my childhood on ADD drugs- first Ritalin, then Adderall. There were a couple weeks on Dexedrine too, but I don't talk about those because I have no memory of them whatsoever. (Kind of why I went off that one. Anyway.) I finally dropped them when I got into college, and in that one year I discovered an almost infinite appetite. In nine months I gained thirty pounds, and I haven't been skinny since. Now, I know stimulants like Ritalin and Adderall can act as appetite suppressants. My question is this- DAE have a similar story? Spend your youth marinated in amphetamines and get fat when you stop? Information on the subject is sorely lacking thus far.  If you did get fat, what other circumstances surrounded your stopping the medicine? For me, it was something like depression- which makes my own data at least somewhat suspect.  If you didn't, what circumstances surrounded THAT? I need both sides of the story here.  I know it's crude methodology at best, but I'm curious to see if my hypothesis even has a leg to stand on or if I'm just tilting at windmills.

If I get put on meds, would I stop fidgeting/playing with things?;;;For the last couple of years I've considered that I likely have ADHD, and after describing some things to my doctor (lack of focus, forgetfulness) while talking about something else, they asked if I've ever had a formal diagnosis of ADD/ADHD, which I haven't. I'm scheduled to see them again next month, and after reading some things here and on /r/ADD, I'm going to try bringing it up.  However, I've always been a fidgeter. I'm almost always playing with my toes or fingers while sitting (which unfortunately includes biting nails), and if I'm standing around or talking to somebody, I always seem to pick up something and start playing with that while talking.  While it does have its downsides (apparently as a kid I used to break a lot of things in my dad's office doing it) it does increase the number of calories burnt in a day. One article I read awhile ago quoted about 300 calories a day. Added on to the fact that I generally enjoy it, it's something I'd actually fear losing if I started taking medication.  Has anybody around here been a fidgeter before starting on medication, then stopped fidgeting once on meds?

Help me with strategies, reddit. ;;;College has basically collapsed around me this week. The assignment was given to me on monday, but two art classes both piling on projects and daily hour requirements and english doling out essays, and classes going until 5 most of the week I just have not had time.      I need to read [Napoleon by Felix Markham](http://www.amazon.com/Napoleon-Mentor-Felix-Markham/dp/0451627989/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1321699161&amp;sr=1-2). Normally, I like history. But this book is brutal.      It is not interesting in the slightest. The manner in which it is written destroys any chance of this. Every paragraph is so crammed with different facts and anecdotes that nothing is expanded on. When something seems remotely interesting it doesn't matter because it's moved on from in the blink of an eye. It's so fast and so slow at the same time it is jarring. It somehow has 300 whole pages of these super condensed paragraphs.... what. 300 pages of this shit. I can knock out HP7 in one day but not this.      I need to answer essay questions afterwards. The professor is adamant about making sure we have read the book. He has said that if he can tell we've gotten the information from another source he will fail the paper.      All of these factors make the book unskimmable. And the way it's written, I feel like it's written for people that already are studying Napoleon in length and we haven't, so I am slightly lost even.         Every time I try to read it I just die a little inside. I've been trying to read it this week but it has been disastrous, I am only like 30 pages in.     Help.

But, I was curious if anyone who also suffers from ADHD has issues with changing your mind regarding just about anything? In particular it really affects my interests. I may be very interested in "Hobby A", but might wake up the next morning and be completely disinterested and decided to move on to "Hobby B". It seems that I can't ever get good at anything because for whatever reason as soon as I make a little progress I seem to do a 180 and lose all interest. It's frustrating to no end.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Shitty day, need input :(.;;;Kind of a bad day today.  I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 13, however, my parents were the kind of people who believed "you don't need Adderall, you need a belt." I went untreated for 8 years. During the untreated years I did horribly in school; I was never motivated to do anything expect focus on video games. I dropped out in 10th grade and was in and out of juvenile for stupid shit. I was originally put on probation for graffiti at 15, and continuously broke my probation. Not going to school, being a smart ass. I never accepted authority.   When I turned 18 I did bullshit labor jobs. I was a electrical apprentice at one time, but after a while I realized I didn't want to come home drenched in sweat every night. I enrolled in GED classes at the community college, it was pretty difficult and a alien concept to me ―  I have never applied myself to school work, and to do it was strange. I got my GED when I was 19 and enrolled in college.  The first two semesters of college were tough. I took a placement test, and was placed in remedial math, the lowest level. I pulled C's the first two semesters, and dropped math, I couldn't do it. After two semesters I decided I needed help. I was depressed, I was unmotivated, I was an asshole to everyone around me, and I couldn't hold a job; I would get one, be into it at first, then slowly over time become bored and quit.  The doctor placed we on Wellbutrin at first, and it slightly helped. It gave me a slight warm fuzzy feeling, and made me not dread studying so much, however, I was still having major trouble just comprehending school. During lectures my mind would think about anything and everything expect the lecture. The Wellbutrin wouldn't let me get my dick hard either, it was back to the doctor.  The doctor put me on Adderall, and my life changed completely. The semester was almost over, but I managed to pull up 2 of my grades to B's. The next semester was 2 A's, 2 B's. Adderall gave me the motivation to focus, to sit down and study. I was nicer, and overall I was a better person. My friends and family started to compliment the change.  This current semester was going great, I have been busting my ass, and was expecting all A's, this would be a first I ever pulled all A's. The most amazing improvement was the math. Holy fuck I realized I am good at math!  This semester I have been using the adderall everyday, and not taking a break, as said before I have been busting my ass. I had a math test today ― all week I had studied and nailed it down. Thursday I decided after months of use, I should take a break. I took a break Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and decided not to take the adderall today, Monday, the day of the test. I stumbled and fumbled and was unable to do simple arithmetic, thankfully I had my graphing calculator and knew how to check my work, I did the math problems over and over until I got the answer I should of. I turned my test in and walked out.  My teacher emailed me 30 minutes later to my edu address; I had skipped a entire page, and had put several answers in the wrong place. She wanted me to come back ASAP. This was at 9am, and I didn't read the email until 8pm.  Lately I have been getting more and more bummed. I keep thinking "will I ever be able to function like a normal adult without taking stimulants?" I want to become a engineering, and I'm 100% sure I can do it if I bust my ass. This new goal in my life is very reachable and it motivates me to do better.  However, I know that without adderall, I will never be able to do the intense school work, and this is a bitter bullet to bite.  Sorry for the long rant guys. I'm pretty depressed about the math class thing, I have busted my ass and had a 98 average. I'm not sure what my math teacher will do, if she awards me a zero it will bring my average down to a 78; a C.
adcb5ff6ff544436fdc71e767fb0fb0f6070ef00050d918dab144f227bbc6be5;;;I'm so frustrated rant/;;;This is fucking frustrating.  I want to do stuff with my life. Intellectually challenging stuff.  Forget want. HAVE to do. Because if I'm not intellectually challenged, I can't pay attention.  Can't pay attention, lower grades, put on the boring class tracks, even less attention, even lower grades. Leading to a shitty job. Leading to no FOCUS, leading to no passion...and I can't work without being passionate, my mind just won't do it!  I work three as hard as everyone I know. Spend almost all waking hours trying to study, trying to focus. But no. When I'm trying to do calculus my brain will start composing music, if I try to do chemistry I start doing math proofs in my head, if I write an essay there is an entirely different essay from the one I'm supposed to be writing running in my head..  When I got diagnosed, I got my IQ tested. Psychologist was beaming at me, both of us were grinning from ear to ear, him telling me that I am testing in the top 1% of IQs, that he hasn't ever seen anyone solve those block puzzles so FAST, that I am definitely over thinking everything, there is nothing wrong with me.  And then he does the TOVA, and the working memory tests, and my smile is gone. Because it doesn't matter how smart I am or how hard I work. Because my TOVA score is so bad that the results can't even be read. I know what every single one of these tests mean, and knew exactly what the diagnoses would be before i stepped in, but I never imagined pressing that damn button when the shape appeared would be so difficult.  All the intelligence and hard work in the world, and my achievements are ... average. Always, just average. If only he would apply himself. If only he weren't so LAZY-That one just makes my head explode.   So the shrink says the words which I've been thinking all my life. You've got so much potential. So many mental resources, that you can't apply because you can't focus. Take the medication, you will be able to unleash so much  But I take that medication, and all those thoughts that are rushing through my head, stopping me from focusing, turn off. Que amazing focus...at first. But suddenly, all my special abilities that separated me from the crowed start to disappear. I can't tell children funny stories made up on the spot without struggling. I don't automatically notice the expressions in the eyes of people I love, read their emotions, unless I am specifically trying to. I don't realize I'm losing my temper until I've lost it.   And I realized, putting those rushing thoughts to good use was the whole reason I wanted to succeed academically in the first place. Can't have it both ways, right?  Whatever, just keep pushing on...one day, I'll be in a position when all the thoughts in my head will be my strength, my advantage. One day...

I got tested for ADHD a couple of weeks ago, which involved a brief patient history and a battery of tests. After weeks of waiting, I got the result back: not ADHD, just some minor depression and anxiety (not serious at all).  But I don't believe this result. There's a lot of behaviors I do that are just so similar. The chronic procrastination can be explained by other things, including laziness and depression(?) and anxiety, and my constant tardiness to my first class due to a complete inability to get up in the morning isn't technically symptomatic of ADHD.  But there's more than just that! I fidget with my legs or something in my hands (a pencil, cloth, etc.) all the time. I daydream very often, and if I'm alone when I do so, I pace or run around or jump off of stuff, usually without realizing I'm doing so. Also, caffeine seems to slow me down: I actually feel tired and give up if I get up to pace.  There's also reasons I may not have ADHD. I'm a pretty organized person, and I don't lose things that I need for class, and I don't think I'm forgetful. The caffeine effect could be placebo effect..  I think the report said that I did okay on the attention tests, thus the throwing out of this diagnosis, but I'm not sure. Even if that's true, how can I explain all these behaviors I have?  So how do I continue? Should I keep pushing that I might have ADHD, or do I give up and accept that the problems I have aren't due to a disorder?  tl;dr: I tested negative for ADHD, but I have lots of ADHD-like behavior. And some behaviors that aren't. Now what?

Sometimes funny, sometimes potentially tragic.  Is this common?  Before I got diagnosed with ADHD, I often thought I had some form of extremely early Alzheimer's disease, cause I used to work with Alzheimer's patients and sometimes, I felt just about as lost.  In the last few weeks before I started to take meds, It got so bad that I kept apologizing to people for being so 'out of it'.  My favourite excuse was 'wow, I am not awake yet, I need coffee', no matter what time of day.  It felt embarrassing because I started feeling like it made me look like I was mentally challenged or something, when in fact I am actually gifted.    If I went for groceries, I'd forget that the cashier handed me my bags and just blankly stare at her waiting for them, when in fact I've been holding them the whole time.  Urgh!   *By the way, sorry for the mistakes, English is not my first language.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;How do you respond to people who don't believe that you have ADHD or say that it is merely an excuse?;;;Background story:  So I was diagnosed with ADHD (predominately inattentive type, but a few combined symptoms) four weeks ago...I've always gotten decent grades in school (top 5% of my class in high school, honors student, etc), but it's taken extra work on my part to focus and pay attention. I literally have three checklists and assignment lists (iProcrastinate, Google Calendar, and post-it notes) to keep myself on task, and even then it doesn't always work. After talking to my mom (who was diagnosed with ADHD as a kid and is currently on Vyvanse) about my struggles focusing during lecture/studying (I'm a freshman in college), she suggested I visit a psychiatrist.   After a 30 minute intensive interview, the doctor diagnosed me with moderate ADHD. According to her, it tends to run in families, and having a parent with it drastically increases one's chances. She initially prescribed me Ritalin, but I had a horrible reaction. I had migraines, felt anxious, and didn't feel like myself. A sort of foggy mental feeling took over. Thy psychiatrist said that such a reaction was rare (but I've read otherwise on here and other sites), but she would try changing medicines. She said she prefers Adderall, but due to the shortage would have to prescribe something else. She changed my prescription to 40mg Vyvanse, and the difference is night and day. I'm usually anti-medicine (for superfluous reasons, of course), but if this is how everyone else feels all the time, I'm jealous of what I've been missing out on.   It's now extremely easy to concentrate, and I crave knowledge (as dumb as that sounds). I sat down to take notes on a chapter for one of my classes and was dumbfounded when I looked at the clock and saw that only 25 minutes had passed. Usually it takes me 1+ hours due to the scattered thoughts and distractions. It was almost as if time was on pause. I can finally focus on what my professors are saying (unless it's really really boring, but that's not the medicine's fault). Studying for exams is no longer a stressful burden to get myself to sit down, it just happens. Thus far, I only take the medicine on weekdays (I can manage my other symptoms during the weekends), and it drastically improves my days, academically, and with my interactions with my friends.   My mom said she has noticed a huge improvement when talking to me on the phone (I live 5 hours from home and only see them on breaks), and my suite mates said they feel like I pay more attention to them when we're hanging out. I no longer interrupt people when they're speaking, and I am able to listen to others better.  My problem, however, has been with naysayers who say they don't understand why I'm on medication. My stepdad told my mom that I did perfectly fine in high school and don't need to rely on medication to get through college because it's addictive and not necessary. Over Thanksgiving, he told me "You're 18 now, so if you want to screw up your body, then by all means be my guest. Just be aware of the consequences" My roommate accused me of cheating because "the medicine makes you smarter and you just need to get over being lazy" My aunt also said she doesn't understand why I'm taking medication. My mom and biological dad are the most supportive, but they heard my frustrations before the medicine and I called them the first few days I took the medicine to tell them how I felt with the improvements. I'm just getting frustrated with people who act like because I had good grades nothing could be wrong with me. I'm not selling the medicine, I'm only taking the prescribed amount, and I'm giving myself a break on the weekends. Nothing I'm doing is irresponsible, yet some people are acting like I'm a drug addict now. How do you guys deal with this?  TL;DR: How do you deal with the naysayers who criticize the legitimacy of ADHD or question why you're on medicine?

OP [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/lnsjy/went_in_to_be_tested_for_adhd_diagnosed_with/).  I was able to see the school counselor. Great guy, and he's focusing on how we can work on my attention problems outside of medication. He's actually willing to listen to my problems, and work on what I actually started this process for in the first place.  The problem is, however, the school's place for referrals is the same place I was tested at originally. They can refer me to other places, but at those places, I'll have to pay out of pocket.  So. Nope. No second opinion. I'm pretty fucked, right about now. I failed out of my programming class; I can't get simple chores done around the house, which is wrecking my relationship. Yep. Can't even practice at HoN, as much as I want to get better. A fucking video game, and I can't get myself to press that matchmaking button to start.  My life is being held hostage by my mind, and I'm powerless to do anything because someone thinks I'm depressed, ignoring the fact that all my symptoms match ADHD, I lack the symptoms to diagnose me with most specific depressions (hence "Depressive disorder - not otherwise specified"), and most fucking importantly: I am not depressed. I am upset. Upset at the refusal to listen, and the subsequent inability to find someone who will.

I can't explain it, everyone just says to me "stop being lazy and just work" or "get off your pc then" but its not that easy, i've sat here doing NOTHING instead of doing homework/studying, its not an addiction to my pc because most of the time that im on it I just end up doing nothing... I really need some help on this and ideas on what I should do, because I wanna' get my life sorted out, I have the potential for great things but I just can't get myself to revise and get the grade and its annoying the HELL OUT OF ME.

Since her birthday is 9 days past the cut off date for kindergarten, she did not start school this year. This ended up being a blessing as it gives me another year to work with her. She is highly intelligent (she is teaching herself to read) and quite the handful. She sees a therapist once a week and right now we are working on getting a handle of her ODD. The place she goes to is awesome as they believe medicating kids is a last resort. This means she is not taking any meds at this point in time, but it might change if she is still having major issues come starting school next year. Right now I am a stay at home mom who really should go back to work, but with everything going on with my daughter I'm really hesistant. The rest of our family includes her dad, a 17 year old brother, a 15 year old sister (both whom have a different dad), and my mom.  The main objective of my post is to get advice from those of you who have any or all of the above and those of you who are parents. I've read that keeping a strict schedule for them really helps out ... which is something really hard for me because I am not an organized person by any means. Things that have worked (or even not worked) for you will be much appreciated.

Things I took for granted as me just being weird (hyperfocusing, for example) I can now relate to with other people! Ok. Sorry, I just cannot express the relief I now feel.   Ok, last year I took a class on "Success" (seriously) and although really strange, there is one strategy he shared that has helped me tremendously.   I plan out my days by time. Sometimes, there is only so much time I can devote to a project/ assignment. For example, here is what I wrote in my planner for yesterday:  * 10:30- Psych appointment (where I finally got diagnosed with ADHD!)  * ~11-12:15- Drop off prescription, lunch.  * 1-1:50- Class (presentation)  * 2-3:15- Finish english paper  * 3:30-4:45- Class (Turn in paper)  * 5-6:30- Home, relax. Eat. * 6:30-7:30- Study Bio chapters 24-25  * 7:30-8- Watch TV &lt;----------TIP: If you want to watch ONLY 30 mins of TV, turn it on 30 mins into the hour- most shows start on the hour, so you will only catch the last 30 mins, BUT then on the hour the program ends, giving you a chance to turn off the TV before you (I) get distracted by the next show.  * 8:30-9:30- Study more.  It goes on like that. It helps me remember to accomplish everything I need to, because I don't let myself do anything BUT what I had already planned (to an extent. Don't completely block out all spontaneity!) Also, it helps me get motivated, because once a task's time period is up, that is it. Either I'm done or it won't get completed. It's like the pressure that sets in when something is due in the next hour, only without the panic if the deadline isn't met. In those cases, I underestimated the time needed, and just "bought" myself another 12+ hours!  Edit: This also helps if you have outside forces that might derail you from finishing tasks. For example, if you get a call inviting you to dinner/ hang out. If you have previously blocked out a time to finish something, like a paper, you tell the friend that you are busy now, but at (based on the schedule above, 5 for me) you can drop by. And then at 6:30, you can leave or whatever.  Ok now go!

I finally got in to see a psychiatrist today, and he confirmed both the diagnosis and also that I'm at the point that I do need meds.  We agreed on straterra, but we had a pretty long discussion about the dosing.  I'm about 100lbs on a good day, so I'm concerned about taking large doses of any medication.  The full adult dose is 80mg/day, and he wanted to start me on that right away.  My brother also takes straterra and he needs to divide his doses because of the side effects - and he outweighs me by 50-60 lbs.  I flat out refused to start at 80mg and after listening to my concerns, he agreed to start at 40mg/day and work up to 60mg, then possibly 80mg if I'm doing ok.  This is with my full understanding that it may take longer to get the maximal benefit.  So I have two questions:  - any other adults doing fine with less than 80mg/day?  - if so, how did you arrive at that dose?  Was it because of side effects or because you found you were able to get the full benefit with the smaller dose?

"When I was young I always crashed into things and got hurt- eventually the doctors realized very soon that I had horrendous eyesight. When I was 6-8 years old I got my very first pair of glasses that were custom for me.  He hadn't even know that leaves were not just a bushily single entity, this was the first time he had noticed the edges and distinctions.  Today was one of the best days of my life. I was able to get to class, actually pay attention, socialize with neighbors much more, I did all my household chores, basically everything but actual schoolwork.  This was one of the first days in my life where I was able to just be me. Words do not do justice to a veil that has been over your eyes your entire life being lifted up. Kind of an Allegory of the Cave metaphor.   I just got prescribed 10mg xr, it didn't' do much and SWIM has done way to much of this drug before but for recreational purposes. I took 2 10mg xr and voyaged out into the world. The 10s do nothing for me from experience, so we will see what happens next.   It helps as well that I have klonopin to keep the anxiety down and ambient to help me sleep at night. My psychiatrist is an amazing woman and has been helping me for 3 years.
e1556fe8cb98d6a8f83cdf6d72411ee596dd8c3e3c6ceda62e8210ae05058c92;;;Any tips for writing long (ish.. 1500 words/about 7 pages) essays in a short amount of time (due at midnight tomorrow, so 24 hours)?  ;;;I was diagnosed earlier this spring. Ever since I started university (and I'm a third year now..), I've been having more and more trouble writing essays. Even when I try to not procrastinate and I really attempt to start earlier, I sit down, stare at the empty page and my brain just .... I don't even know. I just have so many issues with writing papers, I don't even know where to start talking about them. I look up sources and try and read some things. And then I stare at my empty page again and try to vaguely write some intro sentences. And this will just continue for hours, even if I'm not distracted by the internet. Or my brain will just run off and just be like trolololol.   I think my main issue is starting the essay. (then again, continuing it is pretty difficult as well, of course) My bad work habits in this case are mostly procrastinating till the night before and trying to work on it by staying up all night.. but I end up dozing off every 5 minutes and not getting shit done. Even for short writing assignments, I end up doing a really shitty job literally minutes before I have to leave for class. And of course, I end up feeling like shit about myself for procrastinating and doing a bad job. /vicious cycle most of us are probably familiar with...?   So anyway, I guess I'm just asking for tips on how you guys handle these sort of long-ish paper writing situations. In a shortish amount of time, since I have a little less than 24 hours. And yes, that is a short amount of time for me ;____; Feel free to share your stories/similar situations! Thanks ahead of time. And sorry if this post is all over the place.  [P.S. The paper is for an Asian American Fiction class and it's the final paper for a book we (are supposed to have) read, if that's relevant. I have the ebook.]  **EDIT:** Taking a break from writing. Thanks for the comments, guys! I just made it to the second page (single spaced!). I'm going to wait till I get to the bottom of the second page to double space it.. reward? Haha. I made a vague schedule to write about one page per hour, so if my rate stays like this, I should finish! We'll see... I shall report back.
61b290af41a17c175890d6c0fa1f6b4719933aedce718aac2ccdef9164d56f8f;;;ADHD &amp; me. [UK];;;First things first. i am making an appointment tomorrow with my GP to see a specialist. i have done a lot of research on this, but nothing actually productive.  When i was at school, from Primary school (5 years old - 12/13?) I was always hyperactive and usually distracted everyone in my class. nearly all my reports were consisted of *"intelligent, but needs to apply himself or focus on the task at hand"* and i ended up being moved to a different school due to my parents disagreeing with the teachers who called me a problem child. so i ended up in a new school and it was the exact same, i ended up doing a lot of stupid stuff, so the school got a behavioural dude who said i may have ADHD, something which, again, my parents disagreed with them and nothing was done, and it was eventually forgotten about.  Life went on, highschool was the same, college *(the first 2 times on the same course)* again, the same. and i ended up doing a multitude of jobs, none of which lasted more than a year, i got my own house and since then it's always been the same. i am terrible at organizing things/paying bills/doing **ANYTHING** that needs to be done. my home is a mess, i haven't got around to getting carpets yet, i am useless at paying things on time and i have pretty much, as far as i feel, destroyed my life. i have lost my job, my girlfriend, and pretty much on the verge of losing my house. i **know** i need to do things, i need to pull my finger out of my ass and do things, but it feels impossible. i wouldn't sleep for days, and went to the doctors about it, which ended up with me on Zopiclone to help me sleep.  Anyway, one night as i was internetting, i came across [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3d1SwUXMc0) and a lot of the stuff he said fit into place, i actually cried and laughed as i could relate so much to the content and i remembered the old behavioural dude my parents ignored.  Ever since then i have soaked up everything i can about ADHD and can relate to near it all, i don't think i have as much hyperactivity as i used to, i still have spells of it, but no where near as i used to be. I am hoping things go well for me tomorrow, i am not expecting a quick-fix cure-all for anything, but just knowing that i **do** have a problem and can at least make steps/get help with my disaster of a life is helping my mind. i hope through methods/medication i can get rid of that 4am *life crashing down around me* feeling and i can finally be "normal".  edit:- I'll update thread tomorrow on the outcome of the appointment. *someone wake me up*  **Next Day EDIT:-** *Spoke to the Doctor, a different one than usual (good thing?) and made an Appointment to discuss it further and in-depth on Friday.* Made it on time though \o/
6dbcec0325d01d5863e0cad89cce51c1a361f4b624b986c3ec8c7f08bfbb8894;;;ADHD and diet remedies;;;Greetings.   I would like to get responses from people who have tried "diet" remedies either themselves or on their kids for ADHD as a solution to ADHD. Personally i don't have much believe in diet remedies as a solution, i can't personally say my changes in diet have had any effect on my ADHD but then again i haven't tried it explicitly nor probably will i ever.  I view ADHD mainly as a genetic/neurological disorder, which modern research at least the last 10 years has indicated. I believe malnutrition in multiple or isolated nutrients can cause ADHD like symptoms and even ADHD misdiagnostic.  There does exist research that hasn't been identified as severely flawed to my knowledge that nutrients such as omega-3 fatty acids can help children with ADHD and specific learning disabilities reduce ADHD symptoms with a 'medium' statistical effect (.5) on some factors compared to a placebo group. Lower concentrations of omega-3 acids have been found in ADHD people but scientists do not know why which could perhaps indicate why omega-3 nutrients seem to help ADHD children over the placebo group. If you can debunk this research's methods then please go ahead. Research is located here (posted on a omega-3 website isn't assuring but google search suggests its legit)  http://www.omega-3health.com.au/Upload/Pdf/Effect%20of%20Supplementation%20with%20Polyunsaturated%20Fatty%20Acids.pdf  Anyway i would like to some input from those who have tried any kind of diet as a remedy to ADHD. Did you perceive it as something that worked or not. Obviously any result of this discussion here will not be unbiased but it would give a clue of how people regard these remedies.

I've recently realized that I need to get a diagnosis and am waiting until after exams to look into it. When I bring it up that I think that I have ADHD people always correct me and say "ADD" because I'm not "bouncing off the walls."   My understanding is that ADD and ADHD are the same; there are three types of ADHD -Impulsive, hyperactive and combined - and that ADD is just an older name for ADHD. Please correct me. I don't want to sound like an idiot when I talk to people.
cb229c2bce547092a605b093e67faebd2fb2a3506e2c1f3fcf3030a0dafe8e70;;;I'm really new at this whole thing. I was recently diagnosed, and not sure what to expect.;;;Well. This is all a huge, new thing and it's scary and exciting all at once.  Yesterday I was diagnosed with ADHD. I didn't suspect anything like this, I was in because I was depressed. But while I was there, I filled out a sheet where I said "Yes, I do this often, no I never do this, sometimes I do this", etc. Well, I said "I often do this" to all of the tell-tale signs of ADHD. The doctor explained a bit what was going on, and gave me a prescription for Vynase. I haven't started on them yet. Starting Saturday, I'm taking 20 mg every morning for 10 days and seeing him again.  I told some of my friends about what was going on, and some of them are... worried. Most of us aren't "normal", really, and they're concerned that taking this kind of medication will turn me into a mindless zombie. As well, a significant number of them are vocally against ADHD medication, claiming that there are better ways to deal with it. (I wonder if they realize that, though they're allowed to believe that, bringing it up after I tell them that I'm going to start taking ADHD medication isn't going to make me feel any better.)  Anyway, the reason I'm posting is that things people have said are awakening fears I didn't know I had. When they said that I would lose my personality, even though I know that's silly, it got me thinking. How much of the person that I know as "me" is the disorder poking through?  I don't want to go on the medicine and stop liking the things I used to like or (even worse!) find myself unable to find anything in common with my friends. We're all kind of weird, and I like that, but I'm pretty scared of losing them.  If I remember correctly, it said on the page I filled out that having difficulty writing a conclusion after all the hard work is done is normal for people with ADHD, so I feel no shame in what is probably going to be a shitty final paragraph.  I'm scared, and I'm excited, and I just need to talk. For 15 years of my life I've slipped through the cracks, and now I'm (kind of) getting a chance to be normal and I just want to talk to someone. You guys have all been through this (or something similar), and I figured this is where I could turn to. So... Hi! :)

Any advice?;;;Hi Reddit,  After being diagnosed with adhd i decided to try out medication to increase my focus. I am on 10mg Ritalin pills right now.  The positive effect is that i feel more calm and relaxed which is a good thing. It also increases my desire to be productive, although my focus could have been better.  The downside is that it works out very quickly, 2 to 3 hours and i feel i'm losing my concentration but still feel quite "drugged".  Can i expect that over time Ritalin will increase my ability to focus, and finish tasks? I still feel too distracted from time to time.   Would concerta help me? The constant come-down from Ritalin is very annoying.   Will the drugged-out, feeling-slow effect become less over time?

Since I have some anxiety and my family has a history of anxiety and depression, she ultimately decided on Wellbutrin.   I am 24 and this is the first time I have been diagnosed. Is there anything I should watch for with this medication? Anyone out there taking Wellbutrin as well?

I dread the moment when I check my comments and notice several dozen votes coming my way.  What did I say, did I make sense, am I as usual ranting about a subject I have little or no expertise on and for some reason getting away with it?  And worst of all, people commenting and forcing you to come up with more ranting.  I'm pretty sure someone here will recognize the feeling, Reddit feels like a trap.  edit: rant, rant. I didn't even mention that even though I've been diagnosed, I haven't been prescribed medication for over a year now, just referrals. rant, rant.  What a great day.  Start with 1 incomplete rant, realize it's going to take an awful lot of time of editing and you haven't had breakfast or coffee yet, post rant with a comment explaining it will be completed at a later stage.  Browse reddit trying to relax, find something else to rant, get into a rant where you also know you will need a lot of time to edit, post it anyway as the small letterbox really doesn't allow for comfortable editing.  Especially because I tend to skip and connect so most of my sentences end reading like a collision of different sentences by the time I reach the end of my sentence.   Not to mention all those other things that are on my mind, which continually clash with my current activities.  I'm tired.

After a psychologist's report that said I didn't have ADHD, I got referred to a psychiatrist for depression.  After I mentioned that I didn't feel depressed all the time, and that I felt like ADHD makes more sense. After about 15-20 minutes, he wanted to prescribe medications because I displayed massive procrastination, distractedness, fidgeting... He also said I didn't have "ADHD", but just a lot of the symptoms. It was rather shocking to me because it happened so quickly. I was expecting something longer that practically went over my entire life to try to figure it out...  He gave me Focalin XR for 30 days. First day was really weird. I felt like.. maybe zombie-ish for 5 hours, after which I was as hyperactive and daydreamy as ever (perhaps more?). I thought it wore off, but then at the 12 hour mark, I had palpitations and insomnia and such. This scared me away for about a week. After I started taking it again, I didn't feel any of these things, but I also didn't feel like it helped any of the ADHD-like things very much. The one exception is that after I took it in the morning as my alarm went off, it's almost trivial to get up 30-45 minutes later (whereas before, it was absolutely impossible). I also wasn't able to fall asleep again like I usually do, which doesn't make much sense because the pill probably hasn't had time to dissolve or whatever yet.  So I'm thinking of finding a new psychiatrist because this 30-minute appointment seemed irresponsibly fast to diagnose me (or rather, not diagnose me?). Another issue is that I don't really care about meds. I just want to know whether it was ADHD holding me back all these years.  I'm still somewhat at an identity crisis with that. The psychological report said I don't have it, but I find my scores rather odd. I took two intelligence tests. One scored me at 127 (not administered face-to-face, was via computer) and the other at 109 (through the psych). However, from the WAIS, my working memory was 102, and my processing speed was 89. However, my other tests seemed to go okay. The Connors Continuous Performance Test said everything was average except for one score of impulsive on one part. The final conclusion was that attention-demanding tasks were my worst scores but not deficient enough to be disorder-level.  But I still have all these issues. Looking back on my transcript, so many of just my good grades were borderline, only low As because I either did near-perfect on tests or made up a bunch of work at the last second. And chronic tardiness to school because of issues getting up have plagued me since 8th grade and have gotten me detentions, failing grades, and in-school suspensions. And (usually in private) I daydream constantly, and if I get too lost in that, I'm running around and jumping on things and not even aware of it. And I fidget a lot (tap my leg, play with my shirt or some fabric, etc.)  But then when I see someone else mention that they procrastinated the entire night or keep hitting snooze, or see someone tapping their foot, I get discouraged and think that maybe I'm just normal and failed all this time because of my own willpower or whatever. It's getting tiring not having a yes or no diagnosis..  (Well that was a rather long and scattered post...) tl;dr: I don't have ADHD. I got meds. I still think I have it. But what if I'm just regular? And how do I figure it out when the process of going from doctor to doctor is taking so long? :(

Currently my dosage is at 30mg and I'm afraid its effects are no longer helping me. Halfway through college I began losing motivation and I ended up barely scraping by to graduation. Since graduating I haven't been able to muster up motivation and confidence to move forward towards a career. I'm thinking this is related to my medication not working as well as it should, but I could be wrong.   I feel stuck and unable to do the things I know is best for me. At the moment I don't have health insurance (paying full price for my medication is enough of a financial burden) so consulting a doctor on a whim is not a feasible option for me.  **tl;dr** I feel like my medication isn't helping as much anymore, has anyone else experienced this? Should I implement some kind of lifestyle/behavioral technique to augment the medication? Should I increase my dosage? Change medication? What has worked for you?
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;[UK] What plan of action should I take?;;;I'm 18, from the Midlands and I believe I have ADHD. I remember from starting school being told that I need to "Stop daydreaming" and doing more work. I was a late bloomer where my writing skills were concerned, but verbally I've always been, I guess you could say 'Fully Functional' (My mum says that for the first few days of me talking she was hooked on every word, but after about a week she just wanted me to shut up).  I was diagnosed with "Blank Page Syndrome" in ~2002. I know exactly why I was, even writing this, everything is coming out in random order and I spend a lot of time re-jigging anything I type. But my issues with English kept coming and still plague me today with huge, terrible hand writing.  I talk fast and (even I think) a lot, I struggle to concentrate at school, when listening to people, when reading most things. If I can't get up and do something from my chair, I fidget. At home it's OK, I just go and make cup of tea #20 today. At school I just drum on my legs or just... well fidget and I'm generally a bit of a nuisance. Attempting to focus against this will usually gets me pretty worked up (I just feel like breaking down and crying in the middle of a lesson). I'm ashamed to say I've started smoking more to calm me down.  I've cut out a lot of fizzy pop and other foods that I know just make me worse (Irn Bru, you're a ginger temptress), but often I get giddy and just want to jump around. Alcohol is a bitch as it just makes me want to run and climb trees and shit.  I've read about "hyper focus" and the only subject I ever think this could apply to me on is mobile phones. I love the things. Always have from the first time I laid my eyes upon a Nokia 6110 back in probably '99. When I was little, the best deals of computing were had at what were called computer fairs. I used to go with my dad, find the stalls that did phone modifications and repairs and just ask if I could watch just to see how these things worked inside.   Skip forward to 16, and I got crappy grades at my end of compulsory education exams (GCSEs). Was rejected from returning to my old school and went to a local college, improved my GCSE results and have since returned to my original school where I am honestly very happy.  Now during my time away from school, I visited a GP and spoke to him. Other than being rather condescending and telling me that I was wrong, He started asking me questions like "What do you think I can do for you?" and "Do you think there's a magic pill I can give you?" which I believe was a (pretty shite) attempt to have me admit to trying to get drugs out of him. I've been told that, as a GP, he has no authority to declare me ADHD or not, and that I can demand to be referred to a specialist. But, well honestly I'd feel embarrassed going back and doing that.  Is there a way forward, directly to a specialist, or do I need a GP to refer me?  PS. Does anyone else have a really strong 'urge' to bite down when they're having trouble focusing? I don't chew my pen (which is common) so much as I bite it to breaking point. A baby's dummy is lovely, but they break so easily.

Before I get to the heart of this post I'll give a little background: female, 18, diagnosed with ADHD combined type about 3 months ago (this is not a surprise, just never bothered to get it diagnosed)  Anyway, my doctor gave me a Ritalin prescription along with Strattera and said to take the Ritalin when I felt I needed it. This has caused quite the conundrum for me. I feel guilty whenever I want to take Ritalin because I feel like I "should be able" to do whatever without the added help. I feel judged because I *could* do said activity without it, but it's hard. As a result, even though it really helps, I've taken it 5 times in the past 3 months.   Does anyone else have the same issue? Does anyone have advice about what to do?! I'm definitely feeling lost and a little sad.  **TL;DR: ADHD girl told to take Ritalin whenever she feels she needs it. Feels too guilty to take it even though it really helps because it feels like cheating and because she feels like she can still do the activity without it, it's just harder. Needs advice and support!**
aea51543c7af70ba979ababe1e64e2f37d5d95aa53af79228f394f5fe2827a3b;;;Cancer survivors (chemo brain) and ADHD? No help from my oncologist, and he is poisoning my ability to get help!;;;I have always had problems with ADHD, but because of the attitude of my family toward the idea of it (they just thought I was lazy and unmotivated, and simply punished me - it was the 70's, and that was the common view then) was never diagnosed or treated.   After graduating college in 91 (barely), I was able to muddle through and fake my way through interviews (I interview very well, and landed some great jobs) but invariably lost them because of my inability to multitask, get tasks completed in a timely manner, organize, etc. The usual suspects.   I've done everything from teaching high school to running a coffeehouse, and every job in between. Even went back to school for a degree in graphic art (didn't finish), and lost the job I got at a design firm in town. The problem wasn't getting jobs: it was **keeping** them.   Fast forward to 2007. I was diagnosed with breast cancer, and for a year underwent some draconian treatments - the chemo was harsh. It also destroyed whatever was left of my ability to 'fake it'.  Now...   I now face losing the only job I've managed to hold on to recently: a fairly low-pay, low-demand job. I went from 'one of the best employees' (in management) before cancer to part-time 'sorry we have to cut your hours, you are simply underperforming' in just three years. Lost my benefits as well since I was bumped off of full time. Can't argue my case because my doctor refuses to acknowledge I have a problem, much less intervene.     I can't fake it in an interview anymore so I can't go about looking for a better job with more hours. I can't even manage to match words with the images in my brain. I have trouble completing sentences, and even typing has become a task of 'backspace, correct, backspace, correct' which takes forever. Then I have to re-read what I type so that I can correct any gibberish or wrong word usage that shows up. Every symptom of cognitive problems I had before have increased tenfold. This post has taken more than twenty minutes to type, btw. Close to thirty now.   The problem? My oncologist doesn't believe me. Says he's never heard of chemo brain, and refuses to help me. I have tried other places but was turned away (I suspect when they call him for records or talk to him he tells them that he doesn't believe I have a problem). Finally I called and begged for a referral and got one to a neurology/psychology department. I am praying they will help me and not just assume that I'm 'doctor shopping' for drugs or that I am histrionic. I don't want 'just' drugs. I just want my damned life back.   **TL:DR**, I guess I am hoping to hear from someone who has ADHD/ADD and who has been through chemo, and if there were similar problems. What do you do when the only people who can help you, won't? I live in a small town, there are not other options within reasonable driving distance, unfortunately.

(I'm 31 now)  I'm a professional studio music producer by trade, and my work demands hours upon hours of very focused and meticulous work.    Six months ago I tried some Vyvanse given to me by a friend as an effort to stay awake after a party.  I asked him if I could have a few more for later because I had a feeling it would help me work.  He is diagnosed with ADHD and simply gave me the rest of the bottle since he has a ton of it.  What I experienced thereafter was complete and utter clarity during my work, no more procrastination, and a joyous renewed energy and outlook on life in general.  My focus was streamlined, I was able to wake up in the morning and do my work, and everything seemed to click into place.  It's been great, but I've noticed I'm beginning to "throw in the towel" when I don't have the medicine, and not even try.  This is a sign of dependence, and I want to prevent this.  Any tips on how to avoid dependence is welcome.  At this point, I would like to continue my medication under the guidance of a professional.  Number One:  I can't keep asking my friend for his medicine, and Number Two, I have a ton of questions about dosage, procedure, and how to best utilize the medicine without causing further problems (like depression).  I think I could do well with a much lower dosage (around 10mg).  My health insurance is in place this year, for the first time in 15 years, and my first course of action is to see a psych and begin a prescription under his/her care and oversight.  So we've finally arrived at my original question:  What is the average cost of a psych visit pre-deductible?  After that, what's the cost of a Vyvanse prescription?  Thanks...

He was just tested for the gifted program at his school and passed all the tests with flying colors. However, the district psychologist also recommended that I have him evaluated for ADHD. Now, I'm not entirely blind-sided by this suggestion. He has an older half-brother who has pretty severe ADHD and was diagnosed at age 5. I've also researched the characteristics of children with ADHD because I know that he behaves differently from other children his age and, man, does he have all of them. But now that it's really happening, now that the school has noticed and his teacher has noticed and we're moving forward with an evaluation and the chances that he's just "rambunctious" are getting smaller, I'm scared. I'm scared of the medications he'll be on and whether he'll grow out of it and if he'll be made fun of as he gets older. I'm scared that he won't reach his full potential because, even though he's the kind of scary smart that lets kids graduate from high school at 14, I know the drop-out rate is much higher among kids who struggle with this disorder. I'm sad that his life is going to be so much harder than it should have been. What tips or advice do you have for me, r/ADHD? I know this is long and sort of rambling, but this seemed like the right place to vent about my worries for my little man.
8f5f4d69d460393566cc161f21041ccb4eeb77f3f964a0f8f8184d0530d1c942;;;Switched from Strattera to Adderall IR, day 8. Missing something?;;;**Background:** was diagnosed ADHD at about 14, on Ritalin off and on into university. It certainly helped, but I wasn't sold on the whole ADHD thing, was often fairly ok without meds, and hated the feeling of taking it every day.   Finally went back to a doc a few months ago after a year of misery (change in life situation, focus going away completely, starting to get pretty damn low with professional life going down the toilet), got a diagnosis as an adult (29 now) and, it really hit me when my doc said, "ADHD doesn't come and go, just your life circumstances and ability to deal with it gets better and worse".   **Now:** So, we've been trying to figure out a medication strategy that's more sustainable long term. Started on Strattera and it was like a miracle on day 1. Motivation was suddenly there and I was starting to catch up on things. Some side effects but nothing bad.   On day 5 I realized brand names weren't covered by my insurance, so I asked for a switch to his other non-stimulant suggestion that had a generic, Wellbutrin. A week of that and I gave up because even though I know it could work in 2-4 weeks, patience is not my strong suit. $200/mo for Strattera suddenly seemed trivial for my sanity :P  Fast forward to a month on the full 80mg dose, and it felt like it had gradually completely stopped working, and the daily hour or two of nausea and intensified menstrual cramps really didn't seem worth it. Doc said that wasn't terribly uncommon and we decided it's stimulant time.  I've been working up to 2 x 20mg generic Adderall IR. Day 1 &amp; 2 were amazing. Then gradually less so. It started to feel like something big was missing again.   **Strattera == driver behind the wheel, but no engine**  **Adderall == engine in the car, but no one behind the wheel**  I know if I ask him about changing anything now, he'll want me to stick out the month to give it a fair shot, and that seems entirely reasonable. I have plenty extra of both Strattera and Wellbutrin and it's taking all my willpower to not just start taking one of them, because I want to feel. better. now. dammit!  I can't help but think that the initial days on the Adderall were so much better because the Strattera takes a while to get out of your system, so I had both going at first. My doc was fine with trying them together, but I had felt that the Strattera wasn't doing anything anymore, so he said to just scrap it. Plus I'd probably try the Wellbutrin again instead for the cost and hopefully less nausea. With the Adderall at least *helping* in the meantime, it would be easier to wait it out. With just the Adderall, focus is improved when I can get going on something, but I'm missing the lack of resistance to starting things that I had previously.  I'm not sure exactly why I'm posting here other than for support, any advice or common experiences, and a bit of venting :)   As someone who approaches things in life with research, logic, and confidence, it's so frustrating to play the experimentation and waiting game!

Russell Barkley mentions in one of his talk, IIRC, that about 50% of those with ADHD-PI actually has SCT.  Any thoughts on the validity and in general about SCT?  I'm now in my second year of university, and have now realized I've always had ADHD-PI. Just getting to the stage where I'm trying to study is hard enough, but actually studying is practically impossible. Never struggled in school, but never had to study. I have all the diagnosis criteria for ADHD-PI in the DSM-IV, but SCT describes it better, perfectly to be honest. Will be seeing a Psychiatrist late next month.  So I'm wondering, are there those of you who think you have SCT? Did you mention it to your psychiatrist, did he change your treatment, and to what? How much have treatment helped you?

The more responses the better.;;;I'm predominantly inattentive, and my Vyvanse starts working in about half an hour, wears off in six. Taking it for several days in a row has no additional good effects.  I want to hear from those diagnosed with hyperactive/impulsive type, as well as other inattentive types and mixed types:  1) medications you are taking, dosage, and frequency of use?  2) How long do your medications need to take effect? At what point can you tell they are working? How long until they wear off?  3) Do your symptoms reduce more if you take them consistently over several days? Or do they go away for a few hours and then return immediately? Be sure to specify *which* symptoms (inattentive or impulsive/hyperactive) reduce when.  4) When do you take medications, would you describe the experience as more ~~Energized, or Calm? More Stressed, or Lethargic?~~ EDIT:Let's rephrase, that was too vague... does it make you feel more awake? Or more sleepy?  If you are interested, here is the reason I am asking the question. No need to worry about it otherwise :)   Please answer BEFORE reading so as not to bias the results too much, you can edit in any comments about the text below afterwords. ------------------ There is some controversy surrounding whether people with ADHD are hyperdopaminergenic or hypodopaminergenic. Hyperdopaminergenic mice seem to match hyperactive symptoms and hypodopaminergenic mice seem to be inattentive. Paradoxically, both types of mice become more "normal" under stimulant medication...I think the effects of stimulant medication work by different mechanisms for various symptoms. I suspect stimulants control hyperactivity by affecting receptor up/down regulation, while controlling inattentiveness by effecting dopamine concentration at the synapse. Since these two mechanisms take different amounts of time, I want to know how long it takes each group to receive benefits from medication. I am asking this question just to get some quick and dirty anecdotal data to see if people's experiences line up with my predictions, to see whether this line of questioning is worth pursuing. It would explain some of the paradoxical qualities of stimulant medication on hyperactivity. It would be useful too, because it would suggest that the your symptoms determine the best way to time your medications."  EDIT: Not enough responses. I has a sad :'(

I have a prior diagnosis of ADHD-PI, but have let it sit on a back burner after drugs weren't terrifically effective and I dealt with my bipolar 2. Now my mood has been stable for several months and my brain still isn't cooperating with reality, so I'd like to revisit ADHD and try to get it treated.  Though my therapist was supportive of getting me treatment, she gave me flat out incorrect information:** "the good news is that ADHD gets better as you get older."** Nothing I've read indicates that it gets better. The physical hyperactivity might decline, but the inattentiveness and impulsivity remain.   My psych nurse was a harder sell. He attributes any inattentiveness / flakiness I have to depression, even though I tell him flat out tell him I've lost interest in about 50 different activities throughout my life regardless of mood. I mean, if it was just depression, I'd think I'd go back to the same things when I get better. I don't. I move onto something else. Then I quit, sometimes co-occurring with a depressive episode, sometimes not, never to return to again. So while I'm trying to convince him that the ADHD is responsible for my lack of motivation to pursue consistent activities, he responds with the gem. **"ADHD does not affect motivation."**   He has reluctantly put me on Strattera, but I feel like I'm going to be fighting with him about whether I have ADHD; and if he doesn't think ADHD effects motivation, I don't really see how he is competent to judge whether the drug is working.  So question for raddit: have you dealt with incompetent providers before? how have you dealt with it? are the open to educating themselves? if you can browbeat them into medical treatment, do they do an ok job of prescribing, titrating and monitoring?   **TLDR:** My providers have plain wrong information about ADHD. What to do?

More than a decade ago when I was a junior in high school I was tested for learning disabilities at my own request. I knew something wasn't quite right, thinking it might be ADHD. To my parents surprise (and my dismay) the evaluators came back with a diagnosis: "Some kind of Executive Function Disorder." They didn't have too much information for me on what it was and what causes it. Just that I would qualify for special considerations during exams and get extra study periods.   Fast forward to present day; I have been adequately coping thus far in life, I have a college degree, a good job and a family but every day I find myself reminded of this problem. Examples include:  * The inability to add simple numbers confidently without counting them out in my head (e.g. adding a $13 tip to a $53 meal) * Difficulty recalling adjacent letters in the alphabet (e.g. I couldn't tell you what comes before or after h without singing the damn alphabet song in my head) * Difficulty remembering and keeping schedules (thank goodness for smart phones) * The near complete inability to read music and play the correct sequences of notes. I tried learning the piano for several years when I was younger, it led to indescribable frustration as I watched my peers leave me in the dust. * I often leave letters off the end of words and sometimes add them to the next word (e.g. the boy bough the basketball) * I cannot remember sequences of letters and numbers more than a few characters long. Recalling even short sequences usually results in transposed characters.  These things usually range from mildly annoying to embarrassing. It doesn't often affect my work or personal life in a serious way but there are times when I make a fool of myself with simple mistakes. It gets much worse under stressful or time critical situations. I read that many with ADHD have symptoms of executive function disorder which is why I came here. I haven't knowingly met anyone else with the same problem. Even my wife doesn't really understand my day to day struggle (however minor it may be), nor do I really want to draw attention to it. Unfortunately it would seem there isn't a drug I can take that will help. Focusing usually isn't a problem, the way my brain processes sequences of things is. I know I'm a pretty smart person but I constantly feel like I'm being held back.  EFD sufferers, what are your coping methods? Is there anything you do or take that makes it better?

The first time I got a coach; my psychiatrist wasn't on board with a diagnosis, so I received no medication. It was a wasted effort. The second time, I received treatment briefly, but two medication trials didn't make a significant impact in my life, so I stopped taking them and didn't visit the issue for about a year.  Until about two weeks ago when diagnosing and treating ADHD became the single most important thing in my life. Today I've spent hours on this reddit commenting on ADHD and reading materials on it. I'm perserverating on it -- the same way I'd perserverate on playing guitar, clarinet, jiujitsu, videogames, carpentry, clarinet, etc.   I'm seeing a psych nurse next week. But I'm concerned, in this moment of lucidity, that the next treatment will be ineffective in the short term and that I will lose interest in treating my ADHD as I've lost interest in every project I've ever undertaken. My career is already over -- I'm on disability -- and that was my biggest motivation throughout my life for treatment (which was mostly spent missing the diagnosis of bipolar ii).   tldr; does ADHD make itself more difficult to treat because you lose interest in it?
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Cayenne pepper helps me a lot!;;;Hello,  I am diagnosed with ADHD Inattentive type.  I am currently taking Vyvanse 30mg.  I am a 39 year old female and was just diagnosed a year ago.  I have found the medication to be extremely helpful for me at work.    Pros:  Focus at work, not forgetting to write appointments in my calendar, able to feel motivated to stick to a task until completion, able to do my chores once I get home, a general sense of well-being and excitement to do work, suppressed appetite causing me to eat only healthy food.  Cons:  Hard time settling down at night (unless I drink Rooibos tea), feeling like I can't stop working, forgetting to eat, and the worst... not really wanting to have sex.  Recently, my boyfriend who also has ADHD developed an ear infection.  He didn't want to go to the doctor so we looked up natural remedies.  We found information on Cayenne pepper that sounded a little too good to be true, but its cheap and there was no harm in trying it.  We both added 1/4 tsp. to warm water and chugged it.  We drank cold water right after to sooth the hot spice feeling.  Within 5 minutes the ear pain he had was gone, it moved the fluid out of his nose and Eustachian tube.  We also both felt a huge sense of well-being and our heart rate and blood pressure felt significantly better.  We just felt good.  We have been doing this now every day and his ear infection was completely gone within two days.  The reason I'm posting this here is because I have noticed that when I take this Cayenne pepper 'tea', I notice a complete reversal in the negative side effects of taking Vyvanse.  I usually split mine in half because 30mg feels like a bit too much for me and 15-20 seems to be just right.  Cayenne pepper helps reduce blood pressure and normalizes your heart rate.  I tested this and sure enough, my resting heart rate on Vyvanse is usually around 96-102.  I took it and literally 5 minutes later it had dropped 15 beats per minute!  Plus I just feel it happening.  I also noticed that I was really wanting to have sex.  I also notice that I am feeling hungry.  I don't mind not feeling hungry, but clearly, we need to eat and forgetting does become a problem on my mood.  I'm new to Reddit, so I don't know if the link I included will work, but if it doesn't, look up "17 Health Benefits of Cayenne Pepper."  It doesn't solve ADHD directly, but if you take medication, you may find that it drastically reduces or eliminates the negative side effects you may experience.  Thanks!

A couple of months ago I was going to a psychologist for anxiety issues and was told that their office couldn't test for ADHD because the doctor that did the testing wasn't under my plan (however my psychologist was).   I stopped going because I didn't feels as if we were getting anywhere. Since then I signed up with a new insurance plan (PPO so I don't have to go through a primary doctor).  I'm thinking I should call my old psychologist's office to see if I can get tested now. Or should I just go ahead and find a psychiatrist to test me?  This probably isn't the right subreddit for this, but Aspergers. My younger cousins are possibly on the Autistic spectrum. I began talking to my mom about the way I acted as I kid and made a list and took that to my psychologist. He said that it is possible that I might have Aspergers, but that I would need further testing (which goes back to my insurance didn't cover it at the time).   When I look for autistic doctors they are all listed as child doctors. So who tests for adult autism?

Doc suggested I wasn't "implementing the right strategies" as she passed me the 'script I've been waiting on forever. A common frustration, right?;;;So I took part in a trial which is looking at the potential for cognitive behavioural therapy, without meds, to treat ADHD. I was diagnosed shortly before the 3 months of weekly group CBT began.   CBT was very helpful! Especially because I tried as much as I could to practice and implement the strategies. And I didn't expect it to work miracles. I went in fully expecting only *slow* change (if any) and knowing that results would depend on the effort I put into it. It ended in December, and now there are occasional follow-up sessions. I'm still trying to go through a worksheet now and then, to track my "hot thoughts," and to take good care of myself by eating well, sleeping, exercising, etc.   I would love it if I honestly felt like six more months of the same effort could make as much of a difference with my organization and focus as it has already with my emotions and  confidence (ie, not a big difference, but subtle and enough for me to notice a bit). But it just hasn't.  So, after much deliberation, I finally decided I shouldn't wait any longer to try meds, if anything to help me implement the CBT strategies more effectively and more often. So the doctor in charge of the study wrote me a prescription in an appointment today, and added, just as I was leaving, "The thing about the CBT is that you actually have to *implement* the strategies."  Auugghhh! No kidding, Doc!! They've only told us that about a hundred times. I smilingly replied that it *had* been very helpful in certain areas of my life and that I had deliberated quite a lot before finally deciding to ask for meds. Grrr.   TL/DR: Doc suggested I hadn't been trying hard enough at CBT as she handed me the 'script. I'm trying to let this go (as I've learned to do!) but it really bothered me. Obviously nothing is a "quick fix." I'm almost 26 and my ADHD has caused me a LOT of problems. I just kinda wanna get this show on the road and see if meds will actually do anything for me already.   And I'm looking for your reassurance that I am, in fact, justified in finally trying meds after CBT (which I plan to continue on my own).
4cf480faff58a76f4efc671754f0cd7caf18443bfcb7e7cb5ad5c7eb62f34c64;;;Need advice about meds.;;;So after finding out I had ADHD last year I started taking meds. I was in 9th grade, my parents had known since I was in 2nd grade but didn't think it pertinent until I started highschool and my grades actually started to count. As soon as I found the right medicine (Concerta - 54mg i think) My grades increased exponentially. My problem is I hate the side affects with a burning passion. I hate no being hungry, I hate being moody when I get home, and I hate getting headaches and stomach aches FROM the lack of nutrition I absorb throughout the day. At the same time, I really like doing well in school. I was just wondering if anyone had, had a similar experience and could shed some light on the subject for me or give me some advice etc.  Thanks!

It's only been very recently that I've really noticed that I don't seem to be able to work the same as everyone else in my team, and that's when I started to do some reading.  Background: mid-20s, work in IT. Jacked in my last job because I was bored. Worked a year in my current job, in the process of jacking it in because I'm bored. Start a new job in a few weeks. I work fine when it's something interesting, but I can't seem to do anything menial or anything that I don't find interesting.  This was less apparent at my last job, where I was a senior guy and I had people reporting to me. I found that I delegated a lot of the less interesting stuff, and fixed all the complicated stuff.  I moved to my current job, where my boss immediately noticed that I did all of the complicated jobs, but left all of the boring jobs, despite some of them being a higher priority.  I also have trouble verbalising what I'm thinking, which leads to all sorts of pictures being drawn and hand movements to try to explain what I mean. I often 'get' an underlying workings of something, but that don't know how to explain it, which leads people to not believe that I know how to fix something. Quite often I will be proved to have been correct, but it's very frustrating.  So anyway, back on topic.  I suspect I don't have ADHD as severely as a lot of guys in this subreddit, but I would appreciate it if you guys could share some of your coping mechanisms with me.  At the moment I'm writing a lot of notes on what I'm doing. This helps, as it gives me time to process what I'm doing. I'm also drinking a fuckload of caffeine, and going for frequent walks. So every half an hour or so I will go outside and just do a lap of the building. Then when I come back I can work more.  Has anyone else got any more? I know working in IT is no excuse, but I do feel the lure of the web during the day. I even tried a toolbar that blocked time-wasting sites, but then I just saw circumventing it as a challenge.  I need your help.  I start a new job soon, and I don't want my new boss to have to be as understanding as my current boss is. I want to be able to work and be good at my job without re-inventing un-necessary wheels while I'm in the middle of doing something else.  Thank you in advance.

Like many of you i have/had anxiety, panic attack, paranoia, left schools, no social life, addictions, etc etc. Classic textbook Add.  Now this has been a Crazy struggle almost driving my life in the gutter. Then i got lucky and meet the right people to that inform me of this. I went through all stages of denial and etc. When i researched it myself on the net, i almost cried how accurate it potraited my life. Like someone finally understood me. Feelt like i could be saved.  Now the very few people i decided to tell, didnt give a shit. One said this "you always blame something". Another one just went quit... and this fucker has called me in the middle of the nights with his gf problems. When i spoke to him... nothing.   A few family members says - Some people use that as an excuse! you could do anything if you just applied yourself. They marganilize the diagnosis.   In my world. We are talking about a small part of the brain not functioning well, that had me selfdestructing and leading me right into the gutter.. This hell i been through has been that?? Wtf If no one gives a shit about that, its almost like they wish  for me to go through this hell i been through.   Im at the point now that i will take whatever meds they give me.

Puryear;;;For years since I was diagnosed, I felt like I needed some sort of instruction manual for dealing with my mind's peculiarities. Where other books, *Driven to Distraction* included, offer anecdotes and general strategies, *Your Life Can Be Better* is the manual I've been looking for.  The author, Dr. Puryear, has ADHD himself, and has treated the subject matter in a personal account of the many strategies he has developed in the course of his life for coping with ADHD. The book is laid out well, and each chapter is short and concise.   I was riveted when I read it, and immediately started using a number of the tools in the book. This is definitely my missing manual, and I'd recommend it to anyone with ADHD, and even people without ADHD.

I wanted Adderall so I could get high and work. Now I am trying to not beat ADD but more like do stuff without drugs. Taking speed everyday seems a rather crude fix.   Is there a way to do this without drugs? Is there a way to fix it? I found out that I prefer to have earplugs in most of the time since sounds bother me a lot. Drowning it out in music helps, but I don't prefer it. I just mentioned this because it helped me and perhaps someone else will realize that they don't like exterior sounds as well.   I know diet and exercise are good ways to get rid of it. Any suggestions on what to avoid and what exercises?

Thoughts?;;;"...as we’ve seen, researchers trying to describe human nature are highly susceptible to Flintstonization: unconsciously tending to “discover” features that look familiar, and thereby universalizing contemporary social configurations while inadvertently blocking insight into the truth. Journalist Louis Menand noted this tendency in a piece in The New Yorker, writing, “The sciences of human nature tend to validate the practices and preferences of whatever regime happens to be sponsoring them. In totalitarian regimes, dissidence is treated as a mental illness. In apartheid regimes, interracial contact is treated as unnatural. In free-market regimes, self-interest is treated as hardwired.” Paradoxically, in each of these cases, so-called natural behavior has to be encouraged and unnatural aberrations punished.  The now-forgotten diseases drapetomania and dysaethesia aethiopica illustrate this point. Both were described in 1851 by Dr. Samuel Cartwright, a leading authority on the medical care of “Negroes” in Louisiana and a leading thinker in the pro-slavery movement. In his article “Diseases and Peculiarities of the Negro Race,” Dr. Cartwright explained that drapetomania was the disease “causing Negroes to run away … the absconding from service” to their white owners, while dysaethesia aethiopica was characterized by “hebetude of and obtuse sensibility of the body.” He noted that slave overseers often referred to this disease, more simply, as “rascality.”" [Sex at Dawn](http://luptaanticapitalista.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/sex-at-dawn-the-prehistoric-origins-of-modern-sexuality.pdf), Chapter 8  I have been diagnosed with ADHD and totally think the symptoms are real, but I think its classification as a disorder is the product of a culture the emphasizes productivity over humanity. As a human being, I don't want to sit still and be lectured to until I'm sufficiently indoctrinated to participate in life. This configuration goes against our biology and I think a large portion of people diagnosed with ADHD have subconsciously realized this and therefore find no motivation to go through the repetitive motions that characterize our education system. If you don't take a break after highschool, you'll have sat and listened to teachers and been submitted to their valuations of your worth (grades) for a total of 17 years! That shit is wack. Life is way bigger than institutions, whose boring rituals are a waste of something so precious and fleeting as life. I think part of ADHD is the subconscious realization of this. What do you think?  TL;DR ADHD symptoms are real, but it isn't a disorder. It is a reaction to the culture of production and the dehumanization that culture entails.  UPDATE: Here's a link to a journal article regarding an [evolutionary approach to education](http://www.pdfhost.net/index.php?Action=Download&amp;File=6a40e8d11a40ac0a0555d49019ec56bc)

Anyone interested?;;;With ThJ's [recent request](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/p85l1/hello_would_anybody_like_to_make_a_friend/) to make friends, it seems there's some interest in this community for a more real-time form of communication.  And as per bleep0000bloop's [comment thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/p85l1/hello_would_anybody_like_to_make_a_friend/c3nd9lz), it also appears that IRC may be favored by a portion of the userbase.  Is this something the community as a whole might be interested in?  Personally, I think it would be fantastic to have discussions in real-time with other people who experience similar issues.  And it's not like the channel has to be 100% ADHD all the time (unless of course the community deems it so?), but just a place for similar individuals to congregate and enjoy each others' company.  It looks like #adhd on freenode is already taken, and it's invite only.  I've currently got a bot holding #/r/adhd open, but am hesitant to register it with the chanserv until we get some pretty good support for the idea.

A majority of the stories i have read online talk about how the medication had ruined their lives and how their tolerance just keeps rising to unhealthy levels. Also Requiem for a Dream really creeped me out as well.   So from your experience is it worth it? Bonus question: How did you deal with the tolerance?  Edit1: Thanks a lot guys- it just really freaked me out when i read all those stories online and was just scared about if the doctor might have just over diagnosed me or something.

I don't feel supported in my diagnosis and decision to take meds for ADHD.  I have ADHD and social anxiety disorder.   I just had a breakdown on Friday night because of ADHD and social anxiety (pms was also a factor-however we shall choose to overlook this a slight bit please) I was given meds for the first time on Monday-I took them and they made my head feel clear, increased my focusing to kind of absurd/unnecessary levels, my sister said she notices I can speak more smoothly, and I can actually carry on conversations for the first time in my life-without getting bored and tuning out. However I feel my only support is from my twin and a strange type of support from my bf. My parents do not want me medicated (long term effects, being doped up-yes doped up, because it is a depressant right, I don't want you on meds, look how far you've gone without meds...).    For some reason I know I have ADHD, but it is so hard for me to admit it because I feel like a liar. I feel that the lack of support from my parents does not help (even though they can accept the idea of me having ADHD I think) when I went to get tested my  mom told me she doubted I had it, I wasn't hyperactive as a kid or anything. In part I think being 21 and getting diagnosed makes me feel this way. Even when I started I always felt like I was lying even though I wasn't.

I have had trouble in school in the past, and that is my main concern as I am currently back in college.  If I try to sit down and study, I can read maybe a single page out of my reading before my mind starts to wander, and then a few minutes later I realize I don't even remember what I read.  It is the most frustrating thing I have ever experienced.  Sometimes I forgot important things that my girlfriend wants me to remember, and that sucks. I used to study for 10 hours on a single subject and not be able to finish my online homework.  I feel like there are just thoughts that don't stop popping into my head among other things.  I feel that a diagnosis would first get me some relief in knowing that what I have tried to do for years is not fully my fault when I try so hard.  Is there any advice that you guys might have for me?  I am going to be calling my local medical center to set up an appointment, but it even feels nerve-racking just doing this.

(I'm 21 and live in the UK, btw).  Is he right in saying that a person truly afflicted with ADD would be incapable of even attaining acceptance into University? I feel like I've experienced many of the supposed hallmark symptoms of ADD since childhood, such as personal timekeeping issues, distractibility, severe procrastination, an insurmountable aversion to study and mentally demanding tasks, have lost a job for making too many mistakes, etc, etc. What degree (if any) of societal functionality eliminates the possibility of a person having ADD?

I got my diagnosis in 2004 and tried pretty much everything on earth to get some control over my thoughts.  I ended flying to Southeast Asia to learn to meditate directly from Buddhists monks.    I learned a lot from that experience. In nutshell, the kind of meditation I learned (Mahasi) consists of paying attention of everything moment to moment. You train your brain to notice every thoughts that arise in your mind and how to avoid making a story out of them.   If I was to write everything I have to say about the subject, this post would be too long to read for anyone with ADHD. So I propose that you ask me questions instead.   During retreats I was able to quiet my mind to the extend that I would feel "ADHD free" and also experience deep form of happiness. Sadly, it's not an easy practice and I'm struggling now to bring those benefits to a "normal" life. Still, I consider now that meditation can help me greatly along with my medications.

So I went and talked to him, told him about that, my waiting till the last second to do work, never paying attention during school, even though I graduated with honors, and at work it was worse, zoning out 6 hours a day, but always doing enough work (coding, etc) to keep my job and boss happy. I never was diagnosed during childhood, it never came up.   The doctor said that I am not adhd because I never had symptoms as a child. I'm not sure If I did or not, but I'm kind of depressed now because I know how real my focusing issues are, and I like to paint things in a better light than they actually are.

Without thinking - when I starve myself it's like I'm with a lot of energy and I constantly do stuff - during class I always misread a question and do something accidentlyn on my answer - I never was diagnosed - I was above average in middle school and now I'm doing horribly - I lack a lot of motivation sometimes I would just lay in my room do nothing  How can I make sure of i have it also how can I make sure the counselor doesn't misdiagnose or give me a wrong treatment. What should I also look forward too?  Thanks reddit!

I'm a 19 year old male living in The Netherlands and I have been diagnosed with ADD.   Today I was thinking about my ADD and testosterone suddenly popped up into my head. I started to investigate low testosterone levels and ADD/ADHD. But I don't have enough knowledge on this knowledge.  What I've seen is that low testosterone levels can aggravate ADD/ADHD. Anyone out there with more knowledge on this subject?  PS Sorry for my poor english.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;I need advice;;;So, I am a 20 year old male college student and have recently realized certain things about myself that are consistent with ADD symptoms.  What was mainly shocking for me is reading an article with a ton of symptoms and seeing that they line up perfectly with my mom, my sister, and me (mainly being inattentive for me but almost all symptoms were applicable to my mom and sister)  I've always been an inattentive person. I have trouble paying attention in class, especially now that I'm in college and teachers are less so "teachers" as much as "lecturers." Although, I still tend to make good grades because I am a very good test taker and usually am able to teach things to myself right before the test. I have a bad habit of starting projects and not finishing them, and I procrastinate on EVERYTHING. I also tend to have annoying habits that have gotten on peoples' nerves over the years (mainly during school) like beating my foot, clicking my pin, tapping my hands/fingers on the desk. Furthermore, in high school, I not once finished an assigned reading book that the class was working on. I always started and then got to page 3-4 and realized that I didn't comprehend any of what I just read and was thinking about something totally different. I've always summed these things up to normal. Although I generally hide it pretty well, I have a lot of insecurities which I attribute mainly to being made fun of incessantly in elementary school and middle school. (largely because I did not conform to societal expectations in terms of dress and hygiene until late middle school) It never crossed my mind that other people don't have these same difficulties.  Am I just imagining these things? I want to get tested, but neither of my parents would ever pay for that sort of thing. There is a history of mental illness on my mom's side of the family. (her mom is paranoid schizophrenic). My dad has lupus although that's not a mental illness as much as a central nervous system issue. My dad is supportive about me making a decision to do whatever I want but doesn't have the funds to pay for testing, and my mom would just write everything off as ridiculous. Do you think I should get tested for it with my own money? Furthermore, if I do get diagnosed with ADD, are the medications harmful? My dad seems to have the impression that the main drugs prescribed for ADD are permanently mind-altering and highly addictive, which scares me a lot.  Anyway, that pretty much sums up my situation.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;What was it like for you growing up? How have you learned to adapt and cope, particularly those who are treatment-resistant or going without medication? AKA Is there hope for me and my family with a life coach?;;;My oldest child is turning 10 this summer. Since his birth, my family life has been nothing short of chaotic. I never knew I struggled with attention issues until I was required to split my focus; previously, I'd always been very energetic, capable, obedient, etc. He is on medication, but my husband and I would really like to try to take him off, at least for this coming summer. Since he started meds, our lives have been less tense and stressful, but we are still without any structure.   After ten years, I'm about done and fed up with the lack of structure in our lives. Thing is, I don't know how to create it. And I can't continue operating under the delusion that I should be able to simply do it, because all it does is make me feel pretty rotten about myself. My son struggles quite a bit, and I feel like I've failed him and my family because I've never been successful at modeling appropriate behavior for him. And my daughter... She is just like me, which makes me worry even more. It's not a simple matter of just doing it. I tend to become paralyzed in the face of any task, and in the grips of that paralysis I'll become hyper-focused on, say, organizing the dishes in the dishwasher, as opposed to... well, creating overall structure for my LIFE.   I'm on medication, but nothing has ever helped eliminate my inability to focus, ever. No slowing of thoughts, no sudden clarity, nothing like what I've heard other people experience. I'm trying not to let this break my heart, quite honestly. I've gone through most types of medication and hit the upper limits when it comes to dosage amounts. I currently take 60 mg of fast-acting Adderall, but this is only to help me stay awake once the late afternoon hits, or I have to drive anywhere more than 30 minutes from home. Frustratingly enough, I can take the full 60 mg in the morning, but still have no problem falling asleep for an additional three hours afterwards. My doctor doesn't understand my metabolism.   Sorry, I'm rambling. Basically, my life is the pits and my whole family is suffering. I know I need to be more structured, but there's more to it than knowing. I need guidance, and I wonder if it'd be best in the form of a bird on my fricken shoulder. A little peck and a chirp to keep me on task.   **TL; DR - Is a life coach my only hope? Has anybody used one here, and what was the experience like? Meds haven't helped. I don't want to turn into a crazy bird lady. Please. I need details, points of comparison, something to work with from people who get it and are living, really living.**    PS - This stuff is really devastating. I know people laugh and say, "Oooh, mailbox!" but it's so much more than that to me. I'm really to the point of feeling like there's no hope, and that I've done irreparable damage to my kids in the meantime. They're too old to rescue, you know? What if they never learn to cope because I never did and never showed them how? It's run over into all aspects of my life and it's overwhelming. I feel like I'm trapped, but I can't simply take stock of my prison - I must run in place for hours on end, or collapse in a boneless heap of general surrender and hope others will find me, or - please! - take over. If I could slow down long enough to ascertain what my first step should be, even have the option of taking that first step, then maybe I could start to improve. I want to cry. How on earth do people keep their posts so damn short?! Thank you for any input, and your time. I'm off to therapy. ARGH.
5675d15d2ea359cc25c313ac3ebf048db8d285d55bd84f11e6b30649dec1dc89;;;Link between chronic fatigue and ADHD?;;;I don't know how it is for everyone else, but for a large number of people I've met who have ADD/ADHD, we all seem to come to an agreement that it must have some relation to energy levels overall. Is it possible that ADHD as a whole can be either caused by, or directly related to, the inability to maintain wakefulness, rather than simply the inability to control ones' impulses?  I know that I for one, have a VERY VERY hard time waking up in the morning. It doesn't matter how long I've slept, or how deeply I sleep. Every single day, when I wake up, I'm on another planet for a good 3 hours. I can also fall asleep at will, pretty much at any time - even while standing - the moment I get bored. I don't think this is a coincidence. Also, apparently narcolepsy is treated with the same stimulant medications as ADHD. For those who don't know, narcolepsy is basically the brain's inability to manage a proper sleep cycle. This results in chronic fatigue, and (sometimes) also results in the sufferer randomly falling asleep, even while completely alert and active, simply because the brain's sleep machanism "misfires". however, not everyone loses consciousness at random. More often than not, sufferers of narcolepsy just basically feel tired all the time, with crashes throughout the day. Thoughts?

He was recently evaluated by his school and they have determined that he does have many of the characteristics of a child with ADHD (7/9 indicators for inattentive type and 8/9 indicators for hyperactive/impulsive type). Fortunately, it hasn't impaired his academic achievement (he was also just evaluated for and accepted into the gifted program), so he doesn't require an IEP, but they are making accommodations for him in the classroom. I made an appointment with a psychiatrist and we'll be headed there in a few weeks. What I'd like to learn from all of you is what your experiences were like in school, how old you were when you were diagnosed, what your experiences have been with different medications, and what strategies you use to cope in your everyday life. This subreddit has been incredibly supportive and wonderful, so thanks in advance for everything you share!!  TL;DR Tell me about your life, meds, and strategies for dealing with your ADHD

There has been some improvement, but not enough to get her through her school day (she primarily has issues with impulse control).  We're going to switch her to Concerta on his recommendation.  Can someone who's taken both describe the effects for one versus the other?  I know everyone's different but I'd like to get some perspective  on how this change might feel to her, and how well it's worked for others.  Thanks!  EDIT: Thanks everyone for your input.  This subreddit is extremely helpful for me.

We do see a lot of conversations there, but not everyone is behind their keyboards every hour of the day.  Personally, I've found it to be a great place to talk with people during my first days on medication, still getting a grip on my diagnosis. The subreddit is great for discussion and sharing of experience, but check out the chat to for a little real time conversation.  An active subreddit means an active chat, and vice versa.
ea00c7c993a7258dbd870335f438112b8194972f2d2dbe36932c377c1d35fea2;;;I'm pretty sure I've been suffering from ADHD all my life, went to a psychiatrist a few weeks ago and got diagnosed, got meds... Advice on how to take them effectively?;;;Hi everybody,  I've been lurking this subreddit casually ever since I got diagnosed and prescribed meds. My psychiatrist wanted me to try out 5 mg Ritalin to start off, to see how I felt and how it worked, and if I didn't like it maybe we could try something else. For reference, I'm a 25 y.o. male, college grad, majored in Chemical Engineering at a top-100 school (though didn't get very good grades while there), and currently working a high-paying, high-demand job in biotech.  Anyway, I've been experimenting with different dosages of the 5 mg pills to see when I feel it and when I don't, and the mental effects therein. I started out with taking 10 mg in the morning, didn't really feel much of a difference. Then I tried 15 and I could definitely concentrate much better. When I took 20, I felt really "drugged up" for lack of a better term, so I've settled on taking 15 for a first dose. I've been trying to see what a good re-up schedule is throughout the day and so far I think what works best is 10 mg every 3 hours or so.  The problem I'm having now, however, is that, while I'm on the meds, and I know I'm on the meds, everything is great. I get work done, I stay on task, don't get too distracted with things like Reddit during work or jumping around from project to project. BUT, when I'm off of meds, my impulsivity goes through the roof. I haven't been able to stay on my diet at all these past couple of weeks even though I didn't really have too much trouble doing so prior to that (I lost about 30 pounds over last summer). Same deal with going to the gym after work, I haven't been able to keep a consistent schedule. This among other things I've been trying to control, it just feels like I have no control. My last dose is usually around 3-4 pm so I can finish out the work day and fall asleep at a decent time, but when the meds wear off, it seems as if I am useless and even worse with impulsivity than I was before I started taking the Ritalin.  Help? Advice?  Thanks in advance.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;I'm not sure if I'm self-diagnosing myself accurately, but I'm terrified of the stigma of being a 20/M going to a psychiatrist for ADHD (more details inside).;;;First of all, I'm sorry if this question is asked too often, but it's nice to get replies addressed specifically to my situation.   Kind of a lot to set up the stage. I went to my school psychiatrist who was convinced I had depression and social anxiety and prescribed me with almost all of the SSRI's under the sun. I was also seeing a therapist at the time, who helped me deal with a lot of issues dealing with self-esteem. The antidepressants made me feel lethargic, unmotivated, and constantly in a fog, which is partially what I had gone to get fixed in the first place. Still, she kept switching me to new ones despite my protests (no luck on trying out Wellbutrin). Eventually I just didn't take them anymore and, thanks to the therapy, I'm probably the happiest I've ever been.  However, whereas before I was distracted by negative thoughts and fear of what others were thinking (which is what led to the depression diagnosis to begin with), I've found now I'm just distracted by anything else I can get my hands on. And I'm still just as unmotivated and unable to stick with anything for more than a few minutes (this post is all the result of too much caffeine) as before. My energy levels also fluctuate pretty dramatically (I don't know if this is related?), where I'll be gung-ho to try new things and make lists of everything I need to do (or write extremely long self-posts on Reddit with thousands of parentheticals), and then crash and dramatically plop on the couch (I should note that I doubt this is the result of caffeine, since it happens equally on days where I have too much and when I have none). I meditate with varying degrees of success, as well as exercise pretty frequently, but I've largely been unsuccessful in holding a lucid train of thought throughout the day to the point where it's getting in the way of school, my social relationships, and my confidence in my ability to get things accomplished. Conversations are difficult to hold, and I noticed myself getting completely distracted last night MID-LAUGH. I don't even know how that happens.  The problem: I've already been to a psychiatrist and ADHD was never even brought up. I've always figured that if I had it, I would know by now, and if I didn't know, my psychiatrist would have pointed it out as a possibility. I've taken Adderall to study before, and I felt that it brought out my potential (I didn't really get the euphoria, took a small dose), but I legitimately wouldn't plan on taking it other than as intended. HOWEVER, I know I could just have a severe case of laziness, and I know there is a huge stigma with college kids claiming they show signs of ADHD out of the blue. Am I just the result of the Internet age, poor time management, and no self-discipline? I've looked into PLENTY of time management techniques, but I abandon them once I get convinced they're not for me.  tl;dr: If I haven't been diagnosed with ADHD by 20, am I likely just trying to convince myself so I'll have an easy way out? The concept of prolonged concentration is totally foreign to me, but should I be able to surmount this challenge by myself?
2bd80e8b061e19bfc9d603e18e089aa8d082bfd42d476fece875a4d0d2b04b49;;;I'm 18 and I think I might have ADHD, but how do I tell my doctor about my concerns? (X-post from r/health);;;When I was little, I could never focus on my homework. It took me hours to do simple math problems. I have never been able to read chapters in books because I get distracted after just a few minutes, and when I do read, I have to reread the chapters a few times because I zone out and start day dreaming. My mom also tells me I forget everything, and that's pretty accurate. To this day, I can't remember to do the simplest of things. Also, when I'm talking to a big group of people, or even talking to just a few or one person, I usually feel out of place because I never can focus on talking, I'm always zoning out and day dreaming to myself. I've also been known to have troubles sitting still. My feet are always bouncing or I'm wiggling my toes or picking at my fingernails to the point of them bleeding. This year was my first year in college. Last semester was rough. I started to deal with a lot of depression, social anxiety, sleeping problems, and a lot of other issues, but this semester has been much better. My social anxiety has seemed to disappear and my depression is at the lowest it has been in years and I'm sleeping normally again, but I'm still having horrible trouble focusing on my school work. In high school, I started out in a very good high school. Lots of kids, lots of different classes that challenged me, and I had a bit of trouble. Then, sophomore year I transferred to a really small school where the academics weren't nearly as good. This made me do a lot better in school, mostly because I could do all my homework in the class beforehand when I forgot to do it the night before. Now, I'm going to a very challenging university and I'm noticing that I'm having more problems like this than before. Last semester I ended up failing some really easy classes just because I couldn't focus enough to read a text book. So, my question is that if this isn't ADHD, then what could it be? How do I bring up these concerns with my doctor, when I've said nothing to him about it in the past?  Edit: Just to clarify, I've only seen my doctor 2 or 3 times, and I've never said anything to him about my mental problems, though I've been contemplating going to counseling to see if they could help, but I haven't brought myself to do it yet.  Update: I went to the counseling center today and met with a woman to talk about my concerns, my depression, social anxiety, and where to go from here. She gave me ways to help my ability to focus and we scheduled a follow up meeting. She did tell me that I definitely show symptoms of ADHD, but she isn't able to tell whether or not it is ADHD or depression. Now, I realize that I wasn't clear on when I was depressed. She thinks that it's something I've struggled with my entire life, even though it's mostly been only the past semester. If I were to go through my school, it would take a really long time for me to even by diagnosed, so she suggested that I go see a psychiatrist or doctor sooner rather than later. They would be able to evaluate me and help me faster than anyone else, so, I'm going to try to find a doctor in the area that takes me insurance. If not, I've gotta wait until spring break to see anyone.

I'm on my last week of my first fill and I haven't really felt anything different at all; side effects or even benefits.  I am still as fidgety as I have always been, and it is still hard to concentrate on things, especially when it involves a lot of thought (just like how I'm avoiding writing a program in Assembly at this very moment).  During a single day about two weeks ago, I was just extraordinarily thirsty in my Physics Lab. I figure it was something to do with dry mouth. That, with the occasional jaw pain (I already clenched my jaw well before starting medication, so it may just be coincidence, but I figured I'd bring it up) and slight elbow joint pain at times (it comes and goes), I haven't really felt anything different while on medication.  I guess what I'm asking is, could the case simply be that my dosage is too low, or that Vyvanse isn't for me? If it's any help, I'm a 19 year old, ~180lb, 6'0" male.  Any and all information or advice is appreciated. I'll be emailing my doctor with information such as this and my HR/BP I've had checked weekly probably come this weekend.

Could I have ADD/ADHD?;;;*Yes I know this may be considered "illicit" however, I am an adult with a genuine medical concern. If I am breaking rules please feel free to follow subreddit procedure as necessary and I apologize for wasting your time.*   I took an oral dose of 20/mg short release Adderall about 3 hours ago. The whole time I have felt calm, focused, and relaxed. I am finding it much easier than usual to carry on conversations, and less socially anxious. (I have been studying in a small group of classmates, whom I am usually very shy around). Are these typical results one would get if they have ADD/ADHD? From what others have told me they get hyper, super talkative, and move "a million miles an hour" when they take Amphetamine. Generally I have trouble focusing, and struggle with extended conversation. I worry that I may have an un-diagnosed mental issue, as it seems that this lack of focus and social inability has increased gradually since puberty. Could someone please point me in the proper direction?   I have brought these issues up with my family previously, but they are very old fashioned and see psychologists as "quacks" and wouldn't warrant me seeing them. Now that I am older (22) I can provide this service for myself. Is this a good idea, or will they not take this seriously either?

I am taking a couple classes at a local tech college, but their clinic doesn't seem to be substantial enough to offer treatment services for add.  How can I find a doctor who will prescribe medication for me and how do I minimize the cost?  Do I need to arrange a transfer of medical records myself before the appointment?  Should I research which medications are most affordable for me before I meet with the doctor so I can specifically request them?    The fact that I don't want to meet with a doctor frequently, don't have a lot of money to spare and want to choose my medication (probably the short term generic adderal or ritalin, I have taken both in the past) makes it seem like I will appear to be a drug seeker.  I'm not interested in straterra or vyvanse or something that I haven't taken because I'm not familiar with their side effects, they are more expensive and they would require multiple (expensive) visits to evaluate dosage and discuss how it is affecting me.  How do I put the doctor's mind at ease over this concern?

One that seems to be really helping is eating an egg each morning.;;;Background: I was having a very hard time focusing for a while or thinking clearly for that matter. I also had a palpable blunt pain (like permanent muscle pain akin to lactic acid build up from exertion) in my head. I looked into what I was doing and eating and one thing I realized was that my diet had barely any cholesterol. The symptoms got worst when I didn't have enough sleep (apparently among other things we produce cholesterol when we sleep?).   I've read that cholesterol is very important to our brain's activity. Just a tip for anyone suffering from adhd and/or depression to try if you don't have enough in your diet. If you have too much never mind. Most food you will find is rich in sugar, sodium and carbohydrates, though you would be surprised how little cholesterol you find in a lot of foods.   Of course this should be part of a whole good nutrition routine. Biggest meals should be breakfast and lunch, smaller dinner (contrary to American habits which don't follow energy needs over the course of the day). Fruits, vegetables make sure to get these in before you are full.

School has always been a big struggle for me- I'm sure many of you can sympathize. Its difficult for me to pay attention to a subject unless I'm very interested in it, And even when I do manage to get focused on a subject i cannot control how focused I am going to get (I explain it by using a photo with a strong Depth Of Field even though they are all in the photo only certain parts are clear)    My organizational skills are abysmal,  as are my sense of time and ability to prioritize tasks. I used to mask my struggles out of shame and a desire to do well in school and make my parents proud, but even my greatest efforts did little more than keep my head above water. When I was finally diagnosed and put on medication, everything was SO much easier- for a while.   Right now I'm a freshman in college, I feel like I'm drowning in the demands of homework, classes and work. I am completely exhausted and I'm falling further behind all the time. And I cant help but think and worry how I will be able to graduate I’m currently taking two programing classes and things are not going as planned I have been trying so hard, and I just don’t seem to get it. The idea’s make sense and are clear and I have to say, my teacher’s are pretty awesome but i can’t remember the stuff, i have been sitting on my books last night for well over 2 hours reading these two pages they made sense and all but when it came to the punchline I couldn’t seem to pull the two strings together, I’ve had private tutors but they helped very little since understanding is not an issue here   I am a total computer geek and I know quite a little bit of JS/HTML/VB and I have books on all of them, but I cant actually “do it” and it shatters me every,  time I’d love to know them but I can’t, nothing I’ve tried worked I am so worried about this semester, I won't make it into my major, either. I'm so overwhelmed and frustrated; I just want to plop down on the floor and cry. I hate that I'm ADHD. Accomplishing anything seems to be 10 times harder for me than it is for anyone around me. I watch all these people my age accomplishing all the goals I have for myself, and I'm so angry at myself that I can't do it too. I just don't know how to go about fixing this. And I'm tired and overwhelmed and stressed beyond belief.
e0ae90c8d123b06447eb0c45364ccdc8a96fc42a16796e6c12992a2be5eccb26;;;Not sure what to do.;;;I came across something about ADHD (the "inattentive" type specifically, I think it's referred to as ADHD-PI) purely by chance not long ago and it hit me pretty hard, I've been noticing a lot of stuff about myself the last few years but it never occurred to me that I could actually be ADD/ADHD... except it described me so spot on that I'm *nearly* convinced I have it for sure. I really don't like to diagnose myself because I'm not a doctor/psychiatrist, but here's where the problems start coming in.  I'm turning 17 in a little over a month, and I've been planning on enlisting in the military at 18 ever since I was 12. The military allows people with ADHD to join, but only if they get a waiver, and they're only eligible for a waiver if they've been off any ADHD medication for at least 1 year. So if I did get diagnosed with ADHD, it would go on my medical record, and even if I did decide to try out a treatment for it I would either have to push back my plans or only take the meds for about a month. Plus the military is facing cuts and can be more selective in who it recruits now. I'm worried having something like ADHD on my record might be a bigger blotch than it was a few years ago, when the military was still gung-ho let's recruit the shit out of people fuck yeah wars.  It doesn't really seem worth it, but here's the thing. My life pretty much went off track in the 6th-7th grade. I went from just gliding through school to failing for the first time in my life and it was such a sudden turn. The work didn't get that much harder. I was pretty confident in my ability to ace schoolwork because I'd always been in the gifted classes, told I was really smart, on the yearly IQ tests they made us take I always scored in the 130s, etc. and then it was like my mind started working at a much slower pace. It would take me forever to recall things, I was forgetting stuff and just NOT being able to remember it for the life of me for short periods of time, I constantly lost focus on what I was doing and it was like walking up a steep incline in muddy, snowy, liquid quicksand just to try and make myself just do my schoolwork at all.  I ended up not turning in a lot of work for awhile and fell into a pretty deep depression. My parents/counselors/etc. thought I was getting bullied or something, but I was just really depressed because I felt like a complete failure and like everything about me being oh so smart had been a farce. I felt like it was easier to give up completely rather than be a failure, and I didn't tell anyone about this stuff because I thought the options were let them wonder why I'm depressed or admit I'm not as smart as they thought and let them all down.  Anyway, I've never really recovered from that depression, only coped with it better over the last few years and tried to accept that I'm just not as smart as I thought I was. But I've always felt like something was straight up *off* about the way I felt dumb, because I never felt like I was "dumb" exactly, more like something was blocking me from being "smart." Mostly with memory retrieval and my cognition. I've been talking to my mom about how my memory feels so bogged down sometimes for at least a year or two, but neither of us thought of anything except eating better (which I could do, honestly).  If I do have ADHD, and there's a treatment, it would be incredible. It could potentially change my life, and change my plans regarding the military (college first). I never really wanted to go to college first, but if there's something wrong with me and there's a way to manage it better, I might have a different outlook on life than I've had previously, I don't know. But I'm quite serious about the military and potentially fucking that up gives me great pause about doing anything.  Some other things about myself that resonate with what I've read about ADHD PI:  1. I fail to follow instructions and finish schoolwork, chores, etc. which really makes me feel like a POS sometimes (especially since my mom has her own medical problems right now and relies on me to do a lot - I **really** mean to do stuff that takes me forever to do when it shouldn't). 2. I have trouble organizing activities. I've thought about this a lot in the past. It's one of the things that annoys me so much, it seems like a lot of the time when I try to organize an activity I just can't get it for some reason. It takes me an inordinate amount of time, and I'm pretty into programming so I run into this problem with projects often. 3. I am incredibly forgetful in everyday activities. I wish I could give a list but I feel like that would look like cognitive bias and if it didn't it would be much too long. Although I realize all of this could be cognitive bias which is why I don't want to diagnose myself. But I'm constantly frustrated by this. 4. I don't know what 'appearing to not listen when spoken to' means exactly, but I do have trouble listening sometimes. I don't know if I'd consider that a symptom of anything though, I've always been that way.  Anyway... I don't know exactly what I'm looking for here, I guess a lot of what I've told you guys is only useful to a psychiatrist, but I think typing all of that out helped me. I guess I'm leaning towards going to see a doc/psychiatrist. What was it like getting diagnosed, and what's it been like post-diagnosis? Have you had much success with your treatment? What are side effects or long term effects you've had? If getting diagnosed with ADHD would potentially mess up something you've wanted to do for a long time, would you still think it was worth it?  Thanks...

Where should I start to get help?;;;After reading almost every thread posted here in the last 5 weeks I am almost completly sure about me suffering from ADHD as there is so many people here who are diagnosed and had close to the exact same experience growing up and studying as me it can't be anything else.  So what should I do now?   **tl;dr**: I am very sure I suffer from ADHD. What do?

I'm seeing a psychiatrist tomorrow where I'm likely to be diagnosed with ADHD-PI. I have been informally diagnosed with it by my primary care physician last summer and was put on Concerta which did next to nothing for my inattentiveness, lethargy, lack of motivation and repetitive loopy mind clutter (my main symptoms). I know every reacts to prescriptions differently and I'll eventually get what I needed dialed in. But is it common for,say, Concerta, to have zero affect and then have Vyvanse or another similar drug have an actual affect? What were your experiences in finding the right medication for your PI?

Upon our first meeting she seemed pretty angry when I told her I thought I had ADD after hearing a local radio host explain his symptoms, and those closely mirroring mine .  She said something to the effect of "No, I don't treat for that," but heard me out nonetheless.   She diagnosed me with Adult ADD, but was extremely skeptical and kept warning me not to ask her for another prescription on multiple occasions.  I do not think I could have exhibited less of a drug addicted personality.  She picked the dose, and the medication, A choice I thought she was more well versed in making anyway.  Even after a year of going to her I feel extremely uncomfortable, and like a criminal when I go in there, so I have since stopped going.  My question is,  is it common for psychiatrist to have a preconceived notion that Adult ADD is a bogus condition?  I have very limited choices on where to go according to my insurance, but for sure will not go to this doctor again.

Ever since I was little I used to be great at lying because I could make a believable story up on the spot. I have a lot of creativeness when it comes to art, I just can never get my hand to go where my mind is. I almost always can create/design useful tools to help me out (though i rarely get around to making them).  Is anyone else with ADHD really creative? Does ADHD have a link to creativity or am i just pulling this out of my gluteus maximus?

One multiple occasions during the day, and especially at night, my internal 'voice' seems to change. Not just a little... I'm talking about drastically! From simple accent changes to reciting phrases in broken foreign languages. Sometimes it's musical rhythms, notes, or just plain collections of noises. I could maybe describe it like a radio tuned to the most worst possible station.   But that's not all. It loops.... Endlessly. I'm trying to figure out if that's just my brains way of figuring things out, if it's going through the garbage of the days  experiences trying to grab onto something important from them. I wouldn't think much of it I suppose, but it can stop me dead in my tracks no matter what I'm trying to do, especially trying to fall asleep.   Thoughts? Insights?

What is weird is that the drug has very little to no effect on me recently, even after 3+ hours I feel nothing. Yet, If I take a 10mg Ritalin IR I feel some effects within an hour that last about 2 hrs. Without any benefits I do still get the Concerta crash and feel very drowsy and zombie like after about 8 hrs of taking the drug. Honestly, if it wasn't for the crash I would be convinced I received placebos. I used to take adderall and it seems that a significantly lower dose (20mg XR) lasted a good portion of the day and had little to no crash. Has anyone else experienced minimal effectiveness of this drug?

I was put on Ritalin and the dose gradually increased to 80 mg/day. I feel that my ADD could be related to some vitamin or mineral deficiency. Particularly because I had B12 deficiency a year before I got diagnosed with ADD. Are their any recommended tests or assays for vitamins or minerals that I could ask my psychiatrist to prescribe so that we could eliminate that possibility? I would appreciate any ideas, since I have to visit my psych in a week to renew my prescription.

My issue with them is that I feel better, but I'm just as disorganised and 'weird' as I was before I knew what was wrong with me.  Basically, I'm just sick of being so vulnerable and constantly second guessing my own decisions, thoughts and feelings. Strattera seems like my final chance of putting the brakes on this rollercoaster I call life.  Will strattera do anything for low self esteem that stimulants can't?  What are the benefits/ downsides of this substance? What can I expect from strattera, how do they differ from ritalin mood wise? Do those of you that are on it feel balanced, maybe even peaceful?  Lots of rambling here, but I guess you're pretty much used to that :-)

Do you ever lose your train of thought, then try to retrace it, or just "shut down" as a result?;;;I have a lot on my mind lately -work deadlines, bills, my social/love life, business trip next week, vacation after that- not to mention a few things I'm behind on.  Earlier this morning I was working on some SQL code for work.  Within a few seconds I got distracted by: 2 instant messages, something going on outside my window, my upstairs neighbor dropped something, another neighbor was just leaving through the front door, checking my calendar concerning the business trip next week, something on the TV that caught my attention, at least one other thing I can't remember, and then back to the code.    That all literally happened within just a few seconds.  Then I found myself thinking, "now what was I just thinking about?"  I had ["tip of the tongue syndrome"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tip_of_the_tongue) about my own stream of consciousness. And I had a very distinct feeling of overwhelming hopelessness in the face of straightening it all out.    This was about an hour after I took my morning dose of Adderall.  I believe I actually had a mini panic attack.  I couldn't focus, my heart was racing and all I cared about was what stupid trivial thing was just on my mind a few moments prior, because it seemed like the most important thing in the world.  Even though I have a ton of work to do, I just didn't care anymore.  I walked away from my work computer, poured myself a drink, took a shower, and I've been laying in bed on the internet ever since.  Now, when I step back and think about it logically, I realize the stream of consciousness isn't really that important.  I have a to-do list and never really forget the important things anyway.    But in the moment, that "what was I just thinking about" feeling is so incredibly powerful, it completely depletes my motivation for anything and everything.  All consuming.  It's been happening to me for years, and was originally why I sought help in the first place and was subsequently diagnosed with ADD just over a year ago.   Whenever a thought does pop back into my head, it's always something trivial. "Oh, I was thinking of a quote from a movie," or "oh yeah, I was going to see if new socks are on sale."    So... sound familiar?  Does this happen to anyone else?

Right as I had the program opened I needed to do work in, I decided to see what the ADHD subreddit was like. After lurking a good 90 minutes on here, here's my first post. I wanna say, this is a great community and the information here is simply wonderful, putting a lot of my anxiety at ease. :) :)  I was diagnosed when I was in elementary school. Typical ADHD story: High IQ, excelled in middle school and highschool (without meds). Got into good engineering school, but without the rigid home structure, I'm struggling, in all of the typical ways.  Currently not taking medication, but I've been talking to a doctor, taken a test to help figure out the medication I need. Hopefully this is soon, but not for at least 4-5 days because he's on vacation. My question for you, rADDit, is I have some work to do in the mean time, and its really hard to stay focused. Any advice on how to stay motivated and focused without medication? Typically I'll medicate with ample amounts of caffeine, looking for alternatives.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Ideas for high-stimulus hobbies? ;;;I am a 21yo recently diagnosed with attention deficit, and am currently taking Vyvanse &amp; exploring suitable lifestyle adjustments (due to related anxiety, etc.) with a therapist as well.   One idea was to set aside time and/or an activity just for myself, and that I 100% enjoy, but this is difficult. I enjoy my job and my schoolwork, but I find the pressure to to keep up or succeed is a large part of that enjoyment and motivation. Other than that, my favorite activities are skiing and ziplining (yep, adrenaline-chasing physical activities), which are impossible to do regularly due to time, money, and distance.   I am contemplating dance or hula-hooping classes, but I am very self-conscious in groups, especially when being bad at things (working on that). Also thinking about getting back into ice skating, but the cost, travel time, &amp; hereditary joint problems are major cons.  **TL;DR** I need something stimulating solely for enjoyment that won't involved being judged on merit (sex and video games don't count). Does anyone here have any suggestions for replacement hobbies for me? Or, if anyone has any personal stories about successfully finding hobbies, I would love to hear them!

I usually erase everything before posting. I still doubt whether I am posting in the right subreddit but this time, I will do it and I will post it because no one I know have ADHD and I would really appreciate any feedback or similar stories.     I live with ADHD-PI, was diagnosed in 2008, I am on Adderall XR 30mg since middle of 2010, but can't afford therapy yet.   I have little to no interest in my success at school. I couldn't care less about computer science.   I work in retail and, even though I really love my job, I fear that I will get stuck in it forever if I quit school.  I alienated and lost all my friends a few years ago and, while I still have some acquaintances, I have trouble finding people who I can relate to. When I do, I often feel I am way more interested than they are. I feel clingy.  When I get back from school/work I mostly browse Reddit. It used to be Facebook, but I deleted it. When I am in a relationship, I like to cook, shop, hike, go to the movies and much much more. Single, I can't find the will to do any of that. I have no daily hobbies, no projects and I haven't delved into any of my interests.   I am having trouble getting interested in my own well-being.  **Edit : Consensus**  * Get psychiatrist * Talk to psychiatrist about possibility of depression and anxiety * Ask about possible medication * Get therapy, it's worth it * Rekindle passion with whatever I used to be passionate about / Find new hobbies * Meet people through said hobbies  Thank you, you guys are awesome. I really should interact with the Internet more, it feels great.

I was diagnosed about 5 weeks ago. I had a melt down at school and had to take some time away. The school councillor gave me a test and said that it was quite likely that I have ADHD. She managed to get me an emergency session with a psych and she agreed that I likely have adhd as well as anxiety and depression issues. She made me wait a few weeks to start meds and on Friday i was given a prescription for Dexedrine 5 mg per day. I took one that morning and felt nothing. I took one yesterday and had to use an energy drink to get me going. I have taken another on today and I can't say that i really feel anything. What am I supposed to feel? What is supposed to happen? I really just sort of feel let down. I have heard about how the meds can turn your life around. I am not experiencing that. Anyone have any input?
cb59490096bf513143527f13bdce4e17ee884dea973803a67b6c7e40673c1394;;;Depression, ADHD, Insomnia -  which is it?;;;I've been having problems concentrating at work. Low motivation, lack of interest in things. But I've also noticed I cannot focus very well. My working memory and attention span are not so great. It has become very difficult for me to focus on my work (programming software).  I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 7 and prescribed ritalin. I went off the meds at 11 years old because I was sick of being bullied for taking "mental pills" etc. I am now 23 (male).  The fluoxetine and citalopram SSRIs I've tried have some bad side effects (muscle tension, anorgasmia, low libido) and they have not helped with the concentration. My mood is lifted but I still find myself unable to sleep after an unproductive day at work. I am fairly close to losing my job.   This seems to happen with just about every new challenge I take up. I can stick at it for a while (~6months) and it then becomes boring and I simply cannot focus on it. I get distracted easily, but I wouldn't say I'm hyperactive.  Obviously depression and insomnia are also causes of these work problems. It's hard to isolate one condition from the other. My doctor seems to be in favour of treating the sleep/depression first, but so far this has not been working. I am seeing a psychiatrist tomorrow, so hopefully I can get a prescription. However I thought I would get a second opinion on weather this is the right way to solve my problems.  **Is there anyone here who is now on Ritalin (or similar meds)** and has been through a similar process. Did it help your productivity and life in general.   **tl;dr** Can't focus at work, depression meds (SSRIs) not working, had ADHD as a child. Would Ritalin help me focus?
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Getting medication next week;;;So I've been on meds before for my ADHD (not the hyperactivity one, the other one that used to be called ADD), but that was a long time ago in middle school.  Fast forward a few years and now I'm a junior chemistry major that has _severely_ underperformed for my ability.  It feels unethical that I had to wait so long to get the re-diagnosis and prescription that I need to perform well academically (especially considering I want to go to graduate school).  My relationships with professors have been spotty at best (even though a couple understand what I've been going through, it's hard for them to see through the "laziness" that comes out due to my mental problems), and my grades have been awful (currently holding a 2.95, despite being one of the brightest majors, and one of the youngest).  It's crushed my self esteem, and I feel like I've had my education and college experience robbed because I couldn't get my work done.  I'll be struggling up until next week when I get the much-needed medication.  For you all who have gone through a period of time where you knew you needed medication, yet put it off or just didn't consider it as a real option, how much of a difference did it make?  I'm hoping (and kind of know despite not taking a semi-regular doseage of stimulant medication as a self diagnoses.  Repeat, I did _not_ do that for a week that would have been (was) the most productive of my academic career) that it makes a huge difference, and I can salvage this semester with good grades that prove to graduate schools that I'm a bright kid with amazing potential.  I'm ready to get past this stage in my life of constant depression and anxiety stemming from my ineptness with getting shit done.  I'm just getting anxious knowing that in about a week, I'll be finishing a transition into the person that I know I can be.    I'm not looking for anything in particular from you guys, I just thought that I could hear some of your stories while sharing mine.  For more background, I went to a highly competitive high school, took a shitload of advanced classes, got a full ride to a decent school then lost it in a year.  Back at a school near home, and after _another_ shitty semester, decided I needed to get real help.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Anybody else?;;;My roommate and I frequently use adderall and study together.  He can take a 30mg instant and then 30 minutes later eat a 3 course meal. I on the other hand, take 1/4 of a 30mg and within 60 seconds my heart rate is up, my eyes are wide, my lungs and nasal passges feel like they have never been more open in my life, I cant even stand the thought of food for at least a day, and sleep is not necessary for 2 days. I have been this sensitive to 7.5mg of adderall for 5 years now. From what I have read this isnt normal and I should have a tolerance by now. I was diagnosed extrememly mild ADHD when I was in elementary school about 15 years ago but I never took any meds until college.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;How to tell relatives that you were diagnosed?;;;Not really much of a question but more of a rant.  I was recently diagnosed at the age of 25 after months at the doctors/psychiatrists.  After absorbing everything and getting the meds, filling out forms for disability, and having to submit countless papers to the government to get disability benefits (Tax Credits, Grants for school) I finally decided to tell my brothers and godparents (orphaned from a young age)  Now all this is fine and dandy, but when I try to explain it to family or close relatives what I have they deny it exists. I constantly get brushed off that   1) my choice of career option is wrong (my close family constantly dissaproves my choice of becoming a nurse, and refuse to see it as a trade... also might add that my brothers/relatives are very very "old country" mentality)  2) and that It's something I can control.  When I try to explain to them that I didn't purposely seek out treatment for ADHD and actually visited the doctors to terrible anxiety issues I was having that effected school, I then get hassled for seeing a doctor about my anxiety issues.    The thing is I havn't told my brothers yet, because I've been recieving aid from them, and I've already gotten yelled at a lot since my whole anxiety/panic attack ideals have started.  I just don't understand why people think it doesn't exist, because it involves the mind.  The same people who berate people like steve jobs who didn't listen to the doctors for convential treatment berate me because I got diagnosed with this from a psychiatrist.  It's very frustrating to deal with, but it also explains alot from the last 12 years.
202b1eaad6a6fcfec166911b66bf6edf5d310d2b964e3f1b1d5f486fac17cb5f;;;I was prescribed provigil which worked perfectly for my ADHD when I was 15, has anyone else had any experience with it.;;;I was diagnosed with ADD when I was 10, but I wasn't put on medication until I was 15 and I stopped taking it when I was 16 (parents really were not motivated to keep up with my script). Now I am 21 and have been going to psychiatrists on and off since I was 19 mostly due to money problems, because I was honest about previously being addicted to Opiates for a while about a year and a half ago all that they will prescribe me is strattera, which I was taking for about 5 months, during that time I was able to slightly focus better, but I got severe depression and was constantly tired, and she would not prescribe me anything else.   Now, I am unemployed and have no insurance and have been clean for a year and a half. I try to motivate myself to get myself out of this situation, but am constantly distracted and keep pushing things off. I can't seem to get things together and make them work for me and every time I try I fail.   I have also tried to get prescribed provigil again for my add when I was seeing a psychiatrist, she wouldn't prescribe it saying that they could only prescribe it for work shift sleep disorder. When I was on it though I was able to focus, I was getting straight A's, I was exercising daily, could manage my money, and had the motivation to do anything I needed to be able to do.  Edit: Sorry, I don't know where I was going with half of this.

I quit, and I'm looking for advice.  Pre-diagnosis: I wake up at noon. I would usually need caffeine for energy before the gym (1/3 of a redbull). I'd then go to class for 4 hours, then have energy to do homeowork until 1AM. I worked at a super slow pace since I was always distracted, but I reliably had energy go do it.   First month with concerta: Amazing! I didn't need caffeine at the gym, and the effects on my focus made my homework/studying easier. Only issue is that it would keep my up until 3AM... I still aimed for 8.5 hours of sleep though.  Second month: I noticed I started losing focus around 9, which throughout the month receded to 6pm. I also become tired around then and couldn't get ANYTHING done. My doctor gave me Ritalin as a booster to take around 5. Now, I could continue working to 1, but couldn't sleep till 3 so I started taking sleeping pills (bennedryl basically). This pattern continued, and eventually I had to quit going to the gym since I NEVER had energy. Instead of feeling good when pushing myself, each push on weights made me more tired. I was dependent on taking the medicine, without it I felt like I couldn't focus and had something missing. No cravings or withdrawal symptoms, but weird.  Third month: She gave my adderall XR to try instead since Concerta stopped working and backfired. Instead, I just stopped taking everything. 5 days in now. I'm clearheaded, sleeping normal, but back to working slowly and distracted. I'm afraid of falling in love with another medicine that will make me super tired. Its nice to not feel like I need medication anymore, I feel clearheaded and normal, which is very surprising. Concerta felt like a mandatory magic fix for a while.  Do you have any advice? I can't figure out why my meds backfired and made me so tired. Should I start taking the adderall xr? I wish I had that focus but can't afford to lose energy like that again.  EDIT: To clarify, the Concerta was 18mg and Adderall XR is 10mg.

I finally had enough and was tested during my last year of college and was diagnosed with inattentive adhd.  I know my mom only wants what is best for me, but I still feel a slight resentment about her not supporting me when I told her I wanted to get tested in high school. I feel like I got by through high school and college on my intelligence, but feel I could have done so much better had I gotten tested earlier. I dunno, maybe I'm in the wrong for feeling a little resentment, but I can't help it. :/   Anyone else feel a kind of resentment about not being able to be tested earlier??

I was working for a client who was my friend previously, he was a very successful entrepreneur. Something didn't feel right but he recently start losing all of the clients he consulted, he came to me emotional and needed to set up an online business.  I promised him I'd help him establish a successful online business so he can live a successful stress free life. I spent 14-16 hours a day on my computer researching passive income models and went from 30mg a day to 90-120mg.  I saw the path I was going down and quit. I asked him if I could take a break, he gave me another motivating sob story, and subtly mentioned "Well maybe it's not a bad thing if it's a tool to get what you want."  So I relapsed, lost all of my friends. I finally quit a second time, made a public apology on every social media outlet I had to be accountable for my poor decisions (In hindsight maybe not the best call, I just felt like everyone should know that I'm sorry and I want to get better).  Last night this guy, alongside my real friends to give me an intervention, but I've been clean for 2 weeks again and ripped up my next months prescription (Well I sharpied go fuck yourself on the name and posted it on my wall to remind me who I used to be). During this intervention while my friends tried to ask what's been going on, I attempted to explain it was working with him, however I'm still struggling formulating my thoughts into simple sentences so it was just a bunch of confused nonsense. He tried to revert the blame back to me and again in one sentence mentioned "However it did help you accomplish a lot in a short amount of time" and once everyone walked out it all became clear to me, so I did research.  He doesn't own any businesses, he only paid for LLCs under his name and did nothing with them He is losing all of his clients because they are all discovering "Psychic" abilities are just a glorified form of psychoanalysis. He makes up stories about spiritual gifts and used that to manipulate the emotionally weak (Which for awhile was me).  He hasn't paid me for my work in 3-4 weeks despite constant promises of setting up a direct deposit. Has lied about being affiliated to celebrities such as Howard Stern, I attempted to contact his publicist. Now that I've asked him before we meet please clearly define the goals of the meeting and pays me for my previous work. (Of which I've done web design, pod-casting, video editing, sound design research, social media marketing, researching a comprehensive diet plan (Which I've decided to optimize for my own purposes).  This all came together, I don't know why I just felt I needed to type this, he used his psycho-analytic techniques to manipulate clients, and picked apart the last bits of my social life and made me feel constantly belittled and powerless without Adderall.  If you read this thank you, it was hard for me to admit all of this, I've realized that Adderall gave me a false sense of confidence, being that ADHD is predominantly on the right side of the brain, I have a theory that dependency on a supplement to enhance my neurotransmitters communication with the left side reduces my ability to function without the drugs.  I'm taking another drug without stimulants, and writing down my daily schedule and I'm happier than I've ever been my entire life. Also I've had more personal success in my own businesses than I ever have. Also I have amazing friends.  TL/DR: Adderall is hard to quit once you go deep, may cause you to learn a lot of stuff, if you have a deep down gut feeling about something, it's for a reason.  EDIT: Not putting emails up to prove my point. Part of my detox was being enraged over dumb things. Basically. I was a Junkie.

Video games have always been one of the only things I could actually pay attention towards. I often hyperfocus and forget to move for 6 hours while immersed in a game. I am sure there are a lot of ADHD gamers out there, so I figured might as well attempt to expand the community over there.  I play a lot of TF2, but own over 100 games (and played maybe 13 of them) due to impulsive Steam sales purchases.   My steam name is **ADHD Santa** (please add me!)  Group name: **[/r/ADHD](/r/ADHD) Hyperfocused gamers**  URL: **[http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ADHDreddit](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ADHDreddit)**  The group is private so I will have to invite you. Either message me on steam, pm on reddit, or leave your steam name in comments if interested.  I figured it would be a fun place to play games together, chat about our ADHD, and maybe keep each other accountable so we don't lose 14 hours by playing Skyrim on a weekend.   Can't wait to meet/play with some of you!!!

Need some advice...;;;Well, my 8-year-old son has been diagnosed by a child-psychologist as ADHD. The psychologist recommended we discuss with the pediatrician, and the pediatrician is likely to recommend Ritalin (or some equivalent medication).  I'm neutral on this (though I would prefer not to medicate him if we can avoid it), but my wife is dead-set against "drugging our child" and "changing his personality". I don't feel like we have enough information to make an informed decision, and every resource I've found on the internet is pretty clearly pushing some agenda or other.  I'm at the end of my rope here. Is Ritalin (or whatever) "safe"? Are there long-term side effects? I've read about higher risk of suicide, heart failure, psychosis, and everything else from hairy palms to hysterical blindness. I have no idea what to believe any more.  To my untrained eye, my son doesn't seem to be hyperactive, but he does have MASSIVE problems concentrating long enough to finish homework or other tasks.  EDIT: Guys, thank you SO MUCH for all your advice. Especially those of you who have lived with it since a young age. I really appreciate it! For now, since it is a verrrry *mild* case, we are taking the diagnosis to his school to get him a modified IEP, and talking with his pediatrician. I think for now we will hold off on the medication, but after a lot of discussion, we're definitely more ready for that, when the time comes.  Thanks again, rADDit!  This is becoming a real source of friction between my wife and I. I feel like I'm being open-minded about potential solutions, and she feels that I'm a monster who is trying to "give drugs to babies".  Please help! (Preferably with medical information, and not marital advice :-)

I visited a psychiatrist because I'll be starting school again for the third time soon and I really want to succeed. My inability to focus was never a problem until college when I found that I actually needed to sit down and study if I wanted to do well. I told her my concerns, she asked me several questions about my daily life and eventually she said that I was "textbook ADHD" and while she doesn't normally like to, she prescribed me Adderall. She told me that it should be like flipping a light switch. Aside from a little increased anxiety at first, it really has been.   I shared this information with my parents and they were, understandably, nervous. My mother thinks that I should be able to combat this without drugs and my father is worried that I'll get addicted to Adderall as it is an amphetamine. I don't necessarily disagree with my mother and I completely sympathize with my fathers concerns but they aren't in my shoes.   Adderall is at least something that I want to try. But I also want to set their minds at ease a little. I can't afford regular therapy at the moment but I'm not adverse to trying it to see if it can help a little more.   So, a couple questions for you:  Are there cheap options for behavioral therapy? Good books? Support groups?  What signs should I and those around me look for when it comes to Adderall addiction?  How did you guys deal with a skeptical parent/parents?  I've got a follow up appointment with my psychiatrist and I'll be posing these questions to her as well, but I just wanted to get some feedback from others in my situation.  Thanks in advance!  **Edit: Thanks so much for all your stories, information and advice everyone. It's really nice to know that there are other people out there with the same issues as me.**
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Is it possible to have Anxiety and ADHD or is it only one or the other?;;;I know I should talk to a Psych first which I did. I had my interview done and will be with another University Psych next week.   But when I see her how can I make sure I get diagnosed properly.  Can I have both ADHD and Anxiety?  Here's what I think happens to me with ADHD  - I get bored of things easily and take a while to finish them if I have too.  - I get procrastinate a lot. Like finishing a paper during the night before it's due. - I forget a lot of details and make a lot of careless mistakes, for example reading a sentence wrong. - I feel totally uncomfortable in the university lecture rooms, like I just want to get up and not be there or something. - I was diagnosed with depression before but when I took the medication I just feel even less motivated than before. - I have little tendencies like fearing people drive too close too me.  - I sometimes can talk to people for 5 min and have good enthusiasm and then just stop caring and not having anything to say. - I have been having this feeling lately like I don't want to do anything and just play video games or just sleep and lie in my bed. - I looked up Restless Leg Syndrome and noticed I might have it, some students in high school were bothered by it but I never really noticed it. - I also periodically feel EXTREMELY tired or sleepy like in class or just at home on the computer and I have to sleep for a while, it's not if it's I have to sleep for 10-15min. I feel better later. - When things get piled up or there's too much to clean or organize I just won't do anything and leave it be.  Here's what I have for anxiety I think: - Afraid of new things like going to the interviewer for the first time. I try to be extra careful the first time I am doing something. But in the end I was extra nervous moving and  unconentrating. - My grades have dramatically decreased from Sophomore year to Freshman in College (I am in College now) with low gpa. - I sometimes sweat so much for no reason. - I find I concentrate better when I'm not thinking, but just doing anyone else feel this way? - I cannot think when I'm anxious it is so difficult. - When I play Starcraft II, the games are intense and when things get heavy I get so anxious, sweaty, unable to make commands or moves. No one else I know who plays this game feels this way during a match. I feel this way all the time.  - I am usually more confident with people around me that I know and tend to tense up and freeze around new people.  So I just want to know if it's ADHD or Anxiety. I don't know what anxiety it is exactly. But is it one or the other or both? If it's both how can I tell my Psych, and what should I go for meds or counseling? I feel I can control my anxiety as it only happens under certain circumstances.  Also sorry for my bad grammar, didn't proof read as it's late right now.  Thanks Reddit!

I was told by my counselor to contact my doctor about my symptoms two weeks ago (half way through the semester), and after getting a preliminary diagnosis I was reffed out to a psychologist for testing. On the 23rd I am going in to discuss my history of symptoms, then on May 5th I am going in for the 2 hour test and only on May 18th will I have a diagnosis.   The problem is this is going to be way past finals week and way past the point where it could help this semester. My grades are terrible due to the structure of the class (which hits upon all of my weaknesses), and I have so many projects to do, none of which I can focus on. Caffeine kind of calms me down, and I'm thinking about buying some no-doz to get things done. Has anyone had any experience self-medicating with caffeine, if so, how much was effective for you?  I was not perscribed any medication and won't be until I am done with the psychologist. I did get a bunch of book recomendations on how to deal with my symptoms...which would be great if I    a. Didn't already do 90% of the things they mentioned (from what I have read).  b. Had time to read.  I feel like I am sinking here...

Now, we all know how hard it is to do something that isn't exciting or interesting. However, we also know how easy it is to spend hours upon hours of hard, and amazing, work towards something that IS exciting, like a video game or relationship or whatever your poison is.  I've recently given up on trying so hard to fight uphill on unexciting work. I just can't look forward to a life where I'm always struggling to do the normal things that people do. I'm wanting to do the things I find exciting.  Here's the issue. Whenever I think about something I am really excited about (Making a website, programming a game, writing a book, etc), the idea is very motivating. However, when it's time to actually sit down and everything slows down, I can't get myself to stick to it. What are some ways that you guys manage your excitement to last through a goal?

Basically you just close your eyes and try to see if you can make 10 shots in a row.  So I tried this just now and was able to make all 10 shots, however they weren't all swishes and there were a lot of nonsensical things going on that wouldn't really be there like weird shapes and colors and changing "camera angles" probably due to my add.  I'm thinking if I could somehow practice and be able to get rid of all the random mental distractions when visualizing, it would help my thinking and my life in a lot of ways.  This doesn't happen only when I'm trying to visualize of course, it happens when I'm doing tasks such as memorizing as well.  Does anyone have any suggestions for me or find themselves in the same boat?  Additional information: I'm 22 years old and was diagnosed with adhd when I was in 3rd grade and took ritalin for about a year and my parents and I decided I would be better off not taking it because of how much it altered my personality, etc.  Thanks.  Edit: if anyone's wondering, I will start doing meditation and following [these exercises.](http://litemind.com/how-to-develop-visualization-skill/)

After a brief introduction of the environmental problem in question—and an explanation of its ecological ‘commons’—please assess the relevance of both Hardin’s and Buck’s analyses. Does this particular ecological issue illustrate the ‘tragedy’ or the ‘triumph’ of commons—or both? How so? &gt;  &gt;Are commons realistic as a scale of reference in 21st century US? Are they in existence? Where? &gt;  &gt;Are the commons an efficacious or empowering as a mode of ecological care/governance? Why or why not?  --------------------------------------------------------------   **The Triumph, Tragedy (&amp; Comedy?) of the Commons**   The ‘Tragedy of the Commons,’ coined by Garrett Hardin in his 1968 essay, essentially discusses the effects of rational, self-interested individuals sharing a common natural resource. Hardin utilizes the classical example of medieval herders exploiting an unregulated pasture to the point of deterioration. Therein lies the tragedy as each rational individual pursues his or her own boundless interests in a world of limited and depleting resources.    Hardin develops a rather cynical view, holding the egoistic population accountable for the tragedy. Though he outlines a number of solutions that involve establishing regulations, his most stressed solution persists: “relinquish the freedom to breed…[for the] freedom to breed will bring ruin to all” (Conca 45). Indeed a radical albeit an unsurprising statement on Hardin's behalf, but I digress. If anything, Susan Buck, author of 'No Tragedy of the Commons,' would agree with Hardin that regulations are necessary to preserve natural resources; however, she disputes his interpretation of the classical example. Though her discrepancy may seem petty, Buck insist that objectively interpreting the law of the pasture is vital in implementing proper and effective regulations. Buck's contentions lie specifically with Hardin's idea that pastures developed from an unregulated condition to a controlled state—quite the contrary.   Buck asserts that even before the medieval era, regulation of the commons whether set by a private party or a governing entity were indeed implemented, even unanimously agreed upon and enforced by the public in some instances. The tragedy therefore, is not due to unlimited resources and unrestricted access; rather, it is the result of the industrial revolution, agrarian reform, and improved agricultural practices. Unlike Hardin, Buck is optimistic in the fact that the general population are law abiding and conscientious of the tragedy. Before monumental development took place, the commons, though “painstakingly regulated,” was utilized and benefited by all hence the ‘Triumph of the Commons’ (Conca 49). Buck primarily holds opportunists responsible for the deterioration of the commons as they initiated mass development that exploited natural resources. Even if the general population was not knowledgable of the tragedy, they would not have the means or capital to produce on the level that private entities have generated.    A modern day example of this concept is found right in my home state of Hawaii. In recent years, Spicy Ahi-Tuna bowls had gained immense popularity amongst the locals. The high demand for these delicious bowls of raw fish eventually caused a Bluefin tuna shortage in the islands in 2009. The tragedy of the commons is demonstrated here perfectly: as the demand for fresh tuna fish escalated, it was in the interests of rational fishermen to increase their daily catch of tuna so as to take advantage of the increasing profit margins. The common natural resource, which in this case was the tuna, was subject to the tragedy of being exploited due to overfishing.   Fortunately, the triumph of the commons manifested in a number of different ways. In order to prevent further damage, The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration implemented regulations that decreased the amount of tuna that could be caught every year (Lum 1). Additionally, sushi restaurant owners across the state also implemented their own set of preventative measures in the form of either increased prices for tuna dishes and/or decreased servings of it in each order; and the customers—who were well aware of the situation—happily oblige. Indeed compromises were made and more regulations were set in place; however, as the triumph of the commons dictates, everyone including the fishers, restaurant owners and even the customers relatively benefitted from the newly implemented regulations.     The Commons debate remains relevant in today’s society, now more than ever because of the increasing public awareness of evident environmental changes we all experience on a daily basis. For example, the public can observe a physical manifestation of the tragedy in underdeveloped countries such as the Philippines and India, where over population along with adamant self-interest has undeniably wreaked havoc on the environmental health of their country.    Despite being conceptualized almost 50 years ago, this concept still remains thoroughly discussed in academia to the point of platitude, substantiating its timeless relevance. Though many scholars agree that the Commons is a clichéd concept, it is for this very reason why it still remains an empowering, if not an efficacious tool in getting the public involved. All things considered, the 'Commons' framework is a fundamentally simple yet effective catalyst to begin one’s general understanding of ecological care and regulation as well as in identifying one's significant role in perpetuating the triumph of the commons and conserving natural resources.

My five year old is in kindergarten.  Without getting into symptoms, both his teacher and us parents have noticed enough to want to get him tested.  While I've been researching about testing, diagnosis, etc. I have a number of questions/concerns I'm hoping this great community can help with.  * The previous minimum age for diagnosis was six, but now it includes 4-5 year olds.  Is this a controversial change?  Should I be skeptical of a diagnosis until it is confirmed at a later age?  * Many on the net seem to think that ADHD is over diagnosed.  Do you agree?  If so, what are the grey areas to look for?  * Any advice for what to look for or ask a clinician doing the testing (or potential treatment)?  I wonder just how firm the methodology for testing/treatment is versus the individual skills/opinion/experiences/etc. of the doctor.  Overall, I'm also concerned that now that he's been suggested towards ADHD that the diagnosis is being treated like a foregone conclusion.  If he has it I want the best treatment, etc. but this deserves a reasoned process.  Do doctors actually say nope...you don't have it?  Thanks in advance for your help!

dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Medication recommendation?;;;**I know this is long and complicated so I don't expect many (if any) people to answer but if you could take the time that would be great!  I'm very nervous about medication.**  So I was just recently diagnosed with ADD and will be getting my test results back tomorrow.  However, the waiting list for seeing a psychiatrist for medication trials is really long so I'll be going to my new (just changed areas) primary care doctor in the meantime.  In my experience, non specialized doctors who don't know you usually just give you the most popular medication that often doesn't work.  Was wondering if there's anything I can tell the doctor to help what he prescribes?  Also any recommendation on doses or your experience with medication (when to take it, what worked, what didn't, etc) would be helpful too!  Or if you have similar symptoms to mine (listed below) it would be great to know what worked for you!  Thanks!  **Info about me:**  I'm 20 years old and just recently (last year) became a very very busy professional programmer.  My main symptoms:  * poor organizational skills (home, office, desk, or car is extremely messy and cluttered) * tendency to procrastinate * **trouble starting and finishing projects** (big one for me) * frequently forgetting appointments, commitments, and deadlines * constantly losing or misplacing things (keys, wallet, phone, documents, bills) * underestimating the time it will take you to complete tasks * frequently interrupt others or talk over them * sense of underachievement * trouble staying motivated * talking excessively * doing a million things at once * tendency to take risks * getting bored easily * racing thoughts * poor mental clarity  For the record, I've been doing behavioral therapy for many years now and my problems only seem to be getting worse.  The problem really seems chemical like my brain is firing off too many thoughts for me to maintain.  I'm very hopeful that medication mixed with the current professional therapy I'm getting will finally get me results.

5384c162e1cd9efef0843fc9cbb19f3c4f2e0b951bb9f456958cd6548679ef59;;;How can I get my boyfriend to consider medication for his ADHD?;;;r/ADHD, I'm at a loss and I could really use some input from people who can offer an insider perspective on ADHD. I'm sorry in advance that this is so long. I have tried to edit as much as possible!   My boyfriend is a wonderful guy and I love him very much. He's creative, intelligent, silly and is always finding new ways to show me that he loves me and that he's committed to us. We're totally a team and I feel so lucky to have found him. We've been together for a year and half and moved in together three months ago.   He has ADHD. He was diagnosed as a child and his mom made efforts to control it through homeopathic means. Diet, exercise, herbal supplements -- even acupuncture (on a hyperactive six year old, can you imagine?)! He has never tried medication. I think it's an option that should be explored. He insists that this is his "journey" and that he wants to deal with it in the way that he wants to. I totally respect that he is an autonomous individual who makes his own decisions, but I've also tried to explain to him that this problem isn't his fault, that it's biological, and that there are lots of tools out there to help him, but he views his "struggle" as more of a spiritual one. But now that we live together, his decisions affect my life much more.   My honey smokes a LOT of pot and I believe he's self medicating. I definitely enjoy partaking but he sprints through bowl after bowl of weed like it's nothing. Lately he's also taken to sprinkling nuggets of hash on top too. It seems like he's just trying to knock himself out and he has trouble controlling his impulses to smoke more. I've asked for smoke-free weeks so we can enjoy it more on the weekends, which was fun while it lasted. Weekends can also get lost to pot binges and that makes me really sad. I want to try new things and explore the world with him, but I feel that he can't enjoy these things without being high. Sometimes I end up just leaving the apartment and doing my own thing while he smokes himself into oblivion, but I miss him the whole time. He's also guzzling coffee and energy drinks and I worry about how he's inundating his system with chemicals.    Smoking that much pot gets expensive and he isn't the best at managing his money, even without that extra expense. This means that lots of expenses fall to me. Anything we need for our apartment, I have to buy. I've bought all our furniture, our kitchen things, our electronics, our bedding, towels, cleaning supplies. I also buy him clothes that are appropriate for work because he can't do that for himself right now. I make more money so it's not a huge problem, but he could contribute if he wasn't spending 30% of his income on weed. I also end up having to loan him money and that makes both of us uncomfortable. He recently borrowed my car and broke the windshield when he threw his cell phone on the dash. He says that it's his responsibility and he wants to fix it -- I know he has the best of intentions -- but it's been two months and I'm still driving around with a cracked windshield because he keeps spending his money on pot. I understand it's not his fault, but it's hard to remember to be patient all the time.   There are other things too. He's a touch oriented guy and will often grab/touch me in intimate areas without thinking. I've told him over and over again that it makes me feel uncomfortable, but I think it's another impulse control thing. He can also just get wrapped up in his own head and go on and on and on about his day without asking me about mine. He fidgets or taps his foot all the time, audibly grinds his teeth every night (bruxism), he interrupts others while talking, and the list goes on. I know it's ADHD and I try not to take any of it personally. From what I've learned about ADHD, his case is pretty severe.    I feel like some of these problems could be helped by a low dosage of maybe Vynase or Concerta, but he insists that he needs more time to sort himself out on his own. I've tried really hard to be supportive. I've shifted our diet so we're eating very little sugar and carbohydrates, I've tried to involve him in exercise (he quit the gym less than a month after I got him to join mine), and I bought him Focus Factor hoping that'd help but he stopped taking it. I don't think he realizes that his problem is affecting me so much, and I'm wondering when enough is enough. I would never force him into medicating himself, but his reluctance to try something that may help these issues is turning me off. He's so, so brilliant and I think he could be really successful if he got some of this stuff under control, whereas now he is struggling to get by. I love him and I want to see him reach his full potential.   As we get closer and I spend more time thinking about whether or not he'll end up as my life partner, I get worried. I couldn't make that commitment to him without knowing that these things will improve and I'm worried that they won't without the help of medication. I know he thinks it's within his power to tackle ADHD without it, but I'm not convinced yet. How can I get through to him that he is hurting me with his methods? Is there a way that I can get him to try medication? Are there any low-dosage suggestions or other homeopathic methods that we can consider? Should I give him more time to do it his way? Am I excusing too much bad behavior? Or am I being too tough? I love him and I don't want to hurt him, but I can't keep going like this without at least the promise of change in the future. Any advice, guys? I'd be so, so grateful.   **TLDR:** My patience is waning while my boyfriend tries to independently solve his ADHD issues. I'd like him to consider medication, but he is reticent. I love him but I need help.
54648111c2fec9cdc63c1ac0184677681ea8fc191f2fcc9d3cf378a096bba9cb;;;Question about a weird fee my CA doctor charged for writing my prescription.;;;I live in California.  I recently got diagnosed and was prescribed Dexedrine.  My doctor told me he had to charge me $20 to "write it on this special pad" and that it wasn't covered by my insurance.  So it had to be 100% out of pocket.   Then I took my 'script to the pharmacy, so it's not like the charge was to actually fill the prescription.  This is completely new and very strange to me as I have really amazing insurance ($0 co-pay for visits or medication).      I tried to google, but it's pretty hard to find any related information and I don't know anyone else in CA that will openly discuss their ADHD diagnosis or medication.   Is this normal, just a California thing, or is my doctor up to something duplicitous.  **TL;DR: Is my California doctor jerking me around by charging me extra to write prescriptions?**

I been laying down on the my couch for almost 2-3 years now, socially isolated in a town where i dont know anyone. No money and its going downhill fast. Ive been more active at times in my life, but my default state has always been to lay down, just stare unfocused at something and daydream the years away. Mental fatigue and anxiety has always been present.  Adderall/Vyvanse is not legal in this country so i got Concerta. Reading that only 20% of adhd-pi responds to this, im hesitant to take it. Especially since im alone and if something goes bad, no one can aid me. Odds are the legal medicines here wont do me good (one in five odds) and i dont want to be a test-subject unsupervised. Waiting for therapists which can take up to 2 years. Im in a very tough spot and need some guidance from you guys. The only positive is that my physical health is good and im not overweight. I still cant do tasks more then 30 minutes before i haft to lay down again, drink a lot of coffee and smoke cigarettes to do another 30 minutes.

You should not take this as a diagnosis of any sort, or a recommendation for treatment. However, it would be advisable and likely beneficial for you to seek further diagnosis from a trained mental health professional immediately.  it was this [test](http://psychcentral.com/addquiz.htm)  OK so the online test thing is stupid and not scientific AT ALL, i get it.  Just thought that it was pretty telling that I scored 79 and i sent it to two of my "normal" friends and they were both in the 20s  Moving on, i have some long term memory "issues."  I can't seem to recall large portions of my childhood and other more recent periods.  I'm getting an MRI to rule out anything physical (doc says most likely not) but the more we dug into the simple tests, he asked if I was ever diagnosed with ADD and says that he has a sinking suspicion that I might have it.  He also went on to talk about how ADD drugs tend to be over prescribed and the ADD diagnosis seems to be given out too often w/o proper testing, so I have the feeling he's not just trying to medicate me and move on with life.  So here goes, time to make my appt for the 4-6 hour testing.  I should have some sort of insight soon.  any advice for a potential new member to the club?  I've added a few books to my amazon cart, going to try to read up a little.  tl;dr: i probably have adult add, ok now what?

The thing is that ADHD is not that much of a *serious disorder*, the thing is that it is manufactured that way by simple fucked up - one-way system focused on as much regularity as possible, stomping individuality and creativity, to better understand this, **i highly recommend you guys to go watch these videos, they are essential for understanding of what ADHD people need from education**:  * [Sir Ken Robinson - School Kills Creativity](http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html)  * [Sir Ken Robinson - Bring On The Revolution](http://www.ted.com/talks/sir_ken_robinson_bring_on_the_revolution.html)  * [Sir Ken Robinson - Changing Education Paradigms](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDZFcDGpL4U)   * [The Young Turks coverage - Finland's Revolutionary Education Program](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlOfZL_J5fo&amp;feature=plcp&amp;context=C4ce591bVDvjVQa1PpcFPa90Qx73V4N8D_YxfuohaYPhwjOC9I5iY=)  * [More about Finland's educational system \(long article alert\)](http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/12/what-americans-keep-ignoring-about-finlands-school-success/250564/)  If those ideas got implemented, the educational system and future life would improve drastically for all ADHD people living in the given country.
556a6459132b68eba0d771b1e7ccd796f053fd144737fcdd0b75aefba86682d6;;;So what now?;;;So I was diagnosed about 2 months ago as having adult ADHD. I have since been put on 10 mg Dexedrine Spansules and it seems to be helping with motivation and concentration which has been fantastic. I have also been learning a great deal about myself and ADHD (I am primarily inattentive) and what it has cost me over the years. One of the things that I have a really hard time with is emotional control. I am quick to anger, I take criticism very poorly and have had really bad bouts of depression and anxiety in the past and I am currently being treated for depression/anxiety as well as the ADHD now.  I am an adult student and the stress is really hard to take sometimes. I am paranoid that I get by based on instructors just taking pity on me or feeling sorry for me. I have never felt like any successes have been mine alone. I feel like it's always because of someone or something else's influence. I don't want to feel this way anymore. I want to find my own success or at least recognize that I have had some success in this world.

I've always had the craziest aspirations and desires. Especially throughout high school, I imagined myself either discovering new laws in natural physics or creating the perfect "government" system. Even now, my life still seems to be drawn to some "big" goal in my future ...which now involves creating Brain Computer Interfaces. I wonder if this is something anyone else ever felt...that they wanted the world to be drastically different in some way and that they wanted to do something in their life that would make a difference.  I feel like you fellow ADHDers would understand, since you, like me, are probably always distracted most by the thoughts in your own mind. Day dreamers, etc, but this isn't a very "typical" thing for people to want. Most people I know (and most people I know do not have ADHD) have no such aspirations or goals that involve not only success for themselves, but literally, bringing about a huge change.  I really want to know if anyone else here has ever felt this or feels like this describes them!

Just in the past week alone, we've had at least 3 people post articles from clearly anti-psychiatry websites.  These websites do not cite any peer-reviewed journals and a simple google research shows that they are clearly Scientologists.   Even the most credible websites (PBS) has some fucking up anti-psych stuff.  They tried to by neutral and capture both sides of the spectrum by having a "psychologist" with a PHD attack another researcher/MD and when the MD did his little paragraph for PBS he retorted back that the guy is employed by the CoS.  It's kind of a step backwards if we keep allowing these websites to alter people's perception of what the disease is.

I recently started on Wellbutrin (actually the generic version) after recently being diagnosed with ADHD. The reason I chose it was because I wanted to us a non-stimulant medication, and it was the least costly. If it matters, I used to be taking Paxil for depression.   I would like to know what others experience with using Wellbutrin were. Anyone else use it?   Thanks.   Edit: Thanks for the replies. I plan on staying on Wellbutrin, as my doc recommends for now and just track my progress. If I don't see any difference then I may try Straterra.

I was diagnosed with ADHD December 2010 at the age of 17; my doctor couldn't understand why it had taken so long as I was "the most clearcut case" he'd seen in years. I was trialled on Ritalin, Equasym and Concerta but they all gave me extreme side affects including nose bleeds, depression, severe anxiety and migraines. As such, after I completed my A-levels I returned to trying to cope without medication. I now study an incredibly intensive course at university (Law) and I'm struggling with my organisation and anxiety. I cannot cope with social situations very well, and people mistake my abject fear for me actually disliking them. (Also I have twitches, is that a by product of ADHD?).  Basically, i don't understand my ADHD, I'm anxious, hyperactive and confused and would quite like some advice. How do you deal with your ADHD? What does your ADHD prompt in you (twitches, hyperactivity, disorganisation)? Would you recommend that I return to being medicated for the sake of my degree and possible social interactions?  **tl;dr I'm a bit of a confused mess right now, advice would be very much appreciated**

(Possible side effect);;;A friend of mine has knows I was diagnosed with ADD when I was young and have been taking 30mg of Adderall the entire time. Recently he's been telling me to stop taking the medication, because I'm addicted/dependent on it to function in school. I'm currently in my second year of collage, I never take more than my prescribed amount, never abuse adderall, and don't use it outside of school. Weekends, holidays, and summer I'm completely off my medication. I've never thought of myself as dependent on adderall, but my friend is convinced that I've taken adderall for too long (30mg 5 days a week during, only during school, for the past 9 years) and that my mental health is at risk. Is there any merit to his claims.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Omitting of prior grades;;;Hey Guys  I'm in a stick situation.  Now while my last semester was OK, I did have a semester that really brought me down and is hurting my chances of getting the courses I need and completing what I want to complete on time.  I was diagnosed with A-ADHD during the spring semester, and have only recently just started my prescription of strattera.  I want to continue on with school but because of my previous failures in college but me commited to trying to finish it i've been constantly floating with a lower GPA which is effecting my registration times.  By the time I'm able to register especially for the summer semester I can't get into the courses that I need.  I find that ever since I got diagnosed that I've had a (severe) form of ADHD and it's difficult for me to do well in school.  It's so severe that my psyche wrote me disability forms.  Now that it's being treated properly I feel like my college isn't giving me the opportunity to succeed.  I'm intelligent and when I really put my mind to finishing something I do really well in it.  For example.  I started off the semester acing all my assignments but started tapering off at the end of the semester because I was being physically and mentally abused by my family, and evidently just gave up.  I was in such a depressive and misreable state that I didn't even know if I was going to make it to the end of the month.   Now I know it's probably a long shot but based on my current circumstances is there a way that I can get a better registration date for my fall semester?  I'm only about 1 full semester behind so I obviously don't mind re-taking these courses.  But I hope there is something I can do to get the old stuff omitted.

Heck, I'm not even doing the "right" thing right now (English paper to write), but if this turns up anything for me, I figure it could help me out in the long run.  In any case, I and my brother were diagnosed with ADHD last year.  We both went on meds, but I suffered from serious depression, and as a result, haven't been interested in trying something different. Plus I don't even have the motivation to go do it, which brings me to my concern.  I watched the videos by Dr. Barkley that were posted on a thread here, and as much truth as he speaks, it depresses me.  I believed that there was something I could do about my ADHD, my lack of motivation, and my nearly complete inability to manage my time wisely, but what he tells me says otherwise.  Especially this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3VuV5Jvazs  I guess I'm just looking for other's response to his videos and/or some advice/help on what to do next. I want to be motivated (I want to be a talented and great designer one day), but now I fear that my ADHD will keep me from doing so.  Actually, I've always feared/known that, but now it's been articulated for me. So.. advice? Help? Stories of awesomeness?  Links to a thread where this is already been done?  Thanks. :)

I was diagnosed with ADHD in September after years of misdiagnosis (everything from bipolar to schizoaffective). Unfortunately, in early November, I got a serious case of the flu that lasted until January, so I blew my medical budget and had to stop the medication (though it was tremendously helpful). After I got better, I felt so much improved compared to being laid up in bed puking, that I didn't think to go back and get my medication refilled. Now that finals are looming and I've got nothing done and can't even read a sentence without losing focus, I'm freaking out and have to start the meds up again if I want any chance of passing.  My only apprehension is a side effect that drives me crazy: I chew the hell out of my lips, cheeks, and tongue when I take the medication (Concerta 54mg). My whole mouth gets visibly swollen and is really uncomfortable. I try chewing gum, but if I don't have any on me, I'll still just do it without thinking about it.   Does anyone else deal with similar side effects? Is there any good way to avoid it, or at least a good method of mitigating the effect?

While reading before his upcoming exam, I keep coming across articles linking Celiac disease to ADHD. It seems that there is a correlation between gluten intolerance and symptoms of ADHD. Have any of you been diagnosed with both? Have your symptoms improved on a gluten free diet?

While dexedrine has more of a euphoric feel and less side effects (though those dont matter to me).

809301d13ae94f9580293777b5b069ae8b2ac7313ab863b266559806fa35b2f1;;;I just wanted to introduce myself, I think I will be hanging out here a lot in the future.;;;I am 32, male, a high school dropout, recovering drug addict (almost 6 years clean), and am diagnosed ADHD.      My only experience with ADHD meds was ritalin for about 2 months 12 years ago. I was drinking and smoking weed heavily at the time. I stopped taking them because I felt like sometimes they were making me better, and sometimes worse. In hindsight I realize that there was no way they could have worked when I could not administer them properly. I kind of told myself then that I didn't need to take meds to be normal. I think I was scared of the stigma, and I was in denial of the problem.      Ten years later I have conquered my battle with drug abuse but my life is that of a typical adult with untreated ADHD. I have piles of stuff everywhere, I am always late paying bills, I don't get anything done, I have 300 unfinished projects, I have trouble in crowds etc.     I have recently had a moment of clarity, where I realized all my problems in life are really only one big problem. I need to treat my ADHD. I will be put on my girlfriends medical insurance at the end of june and plan on seeking professional treatment then. Between now and then I plan on self educating and trying non medical solutions.      This is what I have so far: exercise daily, use my day planner, take l-tyrosine fish oil and a multivitamin, meditate, establish healthy sleep patterns. I know I am missing some key peices to the puzzle, what should I add?      **TL;DR  Hi. I am finally going to get hel....oh look a fire truck!**

Currently I'm trying to save up money for a house with my S.O. but my job doesn't pay enough and I'm trying to build a decent looking resume to get hired in a 9 to 5 Monday to Friday sort of deal... I have some office experience, I've done taxes at H&amp;R Block, as well as worked in retail, but predominantly I'm a waitress -and a mediocre one at that. This leads me to my problem, when I'm writing my resume I feel rather... unqualified and slightly inferior. The resume ends up deleted and reworked and deleted and reworked time after time, leaving me with nothing to pass around to potential employees. I need to get this DONE so I can pay off my student loans and help my man get that house we want! I feel like nothing I put down on paper about my employment history is good enough.... any sources out there for resume writing that are adhd friendly?  **TL;DR**   **ADHD leaves my resume unwritten due to feelings of inferiority and high levels of perfectionism. Need help, sources or advice.**   **................................................................................................................................**  **Update**:   Thanks to everyone for the advice, I got some great perspective and 2 really promising websites.

Could use your experience and advice.;;;Hello all,  I was diagnosed by with ADD a few months ago, and have seen a drastic improvement in my life since being prescribed Adderall XR accompanying a lot of lifestyle changes.  I just recently finished a psychiatric assessment which resulted with me being ADHD with very minor hyperactive, as well as having a generalized anxiety. When I asked the doctor about the possibility of a longer lasting medication, he told me that he'll be recommending  Vyvance 30mg to my GP in place of Adderall XR 15mg.   I have been reading up on this subject, and was hoping anyone who has had a run with both of these drugs could offer me some advice in regards to your compared experience.  My only major issues that I have with Adderall at the moment is the seemingly progressive loss in appetite, unpredictable up time, as well as the unpredictable, and sometimes rather steep come down. Mind you, I have found Adderall to be effective in parts of my life other than ADD, namely a decrease in social anxiety and depression and I would like to see that remain if possible.  Thank-you so much in advance, this sub has been a great source of knowledge for me, and I’m hoping to learn just a little more with this post.  I understand your experience and mine may differ, but I’d like to at least know a few things I may experience from the switch.  Grey
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Recently diagnosed, feel more like shit now about my lack of focus, despite having something to blame;;;So I've thought for a few years that I might have ADD/ADHD, judging from fidgeting, memory, lack of attention at work, messy living/work areas, starting &amp; dropping hobbies constantly, etc. Earlier this year I went for formal testing for Adult ADHD (early twenties), and about a month or two ago (can't remember offhand) I did receive a formal diagnosis from a local psychologist.  Now, I've generally been at least slightly annoyed with myself for my lack of focus, but generally able to brush it off. However, I've now become over critical about myself--my lack of work, the mess in my apartment, how I haven't finished some personal projects I started months ago--and have begun to hate myself for it.  I've been on antidepressants for a few months shy of a year, but lately I've still been feeling like crap, and recently breaking up with my girlfriend of 2 years doesn't help. I've been seeing a nurse practitioner since last year for them, but she can't prescribe controlled substances, so I have to wait to see the doctor she works under before I can get any ADHD medication, which is still a month away.  So, I don't know what I'm really asking, or trying to say, or what, but  **TL;DR:** Recently diagnosed, feel more like shit now about my lack of focus, despite having something to blame

The tests I took were: -Tons of questionnaires  -I'm pretty sure the WAIS-IV IQ test, which had some fun stuff in it (puzzles, math problems) and some boring stuff (vocab, comparing words) -Wisconsin Card Sorting test (wasnt hard, but kept blanking out on the patterns and had to think about it for a while) -Tower of London test -Computer test with flashing numbers and audio of numbers too and had to click for certain numbers I saw and heard (was the hardest of all the tests, the numbers went by so fast it was hard to click in time, and was really boring)  Anyone taken one of these for getting diagnosed? I feel like not much has to do with my inattentiveness (besides the computer test) because all the activities were like less than 5 minutes and fun (except for the computer thing)  anyone know what kind of patterns someone with adhd would have on these tests?
d77a59dc7230b1e3404df3dedb6f4a95f56314f6b9447b65fa81121d32c7c9dd;;;Do my symptoms seem most typical of ADHD, anxiety, depression, or something else?;;;****Apologies for the crazy length****  I'm 19 years old and was diagnosed with depression when I was 16. Since then I've been on and off 3 different anti-depressant/anti-anxiety meds. None have helped at all, and I last stopped taking them in January of this year. (Meds I've been on: Prozac, Cypralex, Pristiq.)    Here are my symptoms:    - I find it very difficult to communicate verbally. This is the most major issue I have in my life. When I talk, it comes out as an incoherent, mixed jumble. I can't explain myself properly. I say things that I don't mean. As I'm explaining something to someone, *I* even realize what I'm saying doesn't make sense.  I can tell they're confused and I can't blame them for it, but I don't know how to explain myself better. Despite this, I seem to be fine with written communication.  - Ties into the above, but I can't pass messages along. If I'm talking to someone on the phone and they want me to pass a brief message to a coworker, I have to either write or type down everything they say, no matter how short the message. Writing and typing help, but sometimes they aren't practical.    - I can't watch a full movie or TV show. I get bored and leave ten minutes in. I like websites, though. Reddit and stumbleupon are great, and I can spend forever on each. I haven't watched a movie for probably 7 months, and a show in even longer.   - I neglect details that, when pointed out to me, were so glaringly obvious and unmissable. This happens a lot of the time at work -- ex: someone asks me to do X, Y and Z, but I just do Y and Z, and forget all about X.   - I have tried and failed at learning the guitar, piano, getting my driver's license (haven't even gotten my G1 yet), any sports that I try (at the gym I get overwhelming anxiety from the thought of not being able to find a free machine...)   Other pertinent info:   - I've never been diagnosed with a learning disability, but do believe I have dyscalculia. Numbers simply do not make sense to me. Adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing do not come naturally to me, especially the last two.   - My Dad has chronic depression which he's on meds for, and my grandpa was severely bipolar.   - I have a summer job right now and will be going into my third year of university in the fall.   - I have never been hyperactive, talkative or social, even in elementary school. I am a very quiet person in general, to the point of being pretty antisocial. I want to be with others, but I find it difficult to open up to them since I can't seem to communicate my thoughts or feelings very accurately.    That's about it, I think. I've gone from being convinced it was depression, to being sure it was anxiety, and now suspecting it's ADHD. Problem is that when I told my Mom about my new suspicions, she told me she thinks I'm over-diagnosing myself, and that most of these "symptoms" are normal. While I agree with her about me maybe pathologizing behaviours that aren't necessarily indicative of a mental disorder, together these symptoms make my life a living hell. It's like I'm at war with myself. I seem to sabotage myself in the most insidious ways.    **TLDR: I think my anxiety and depression stem from verbal communicative issues and I'm not sure whether I'm interpreting normal behaviours as being ADHD, misconstruing my anxiety or depression as being ADHD, or whether I truly do have ADHD**

It's been amazing and life-changing. I've excelled at work and escaped a lot of foggy years where I felt like a failure.  I just got a voicemail from my doctor's office saying they got a heads up that coverage was being suspended due to an investigation of a pre-existing condition. The message said this wasn't unusual, but that I needed to respond to a letter I would get. Later in the day, I got two calls to my Google Voice from what I think is Blue Shield, saying to contact my provider at their 800 number.  Before I contact them, I'm really hoping to get advice on how to proceed. Insurance is so scary and I feel like a miss step could screw up my coverage. I just started getting my feet back on the ground financially and I won't be able to cover this myself.   I've never been diagnosed before, but over five years ago in another state I told a general physician that I was struggling with focus and he prescribed a stimulant to try. It didn't work for me and I didn't follow up on it. Does insurance have access to information like that? I don't even remember that doctor's name. Would they consider that diagnosis even though he wasn't a psychiatrist and there was no measurement of any kind?  Has anyone dealt with this before? I want to have my ducks in a row before I follow-up with my insurance company. I feel so deeply discouraged.

Anyway, I'm in college, first year, history, and there's a hell of a lot literature that *I just can't handle*. No concentration, my mind's a mess, everything each and every one of you is already familiar with.  The thing is, I never had to study, but got away with it because I know with words. It's not that I *never* studied, just never as much as I should have to have straight A's. I went for the pass since it was the easy way out, and studying was torture, no matter how interesting it got; the only thing I got right away were languages and history. And now, college + ADD are making one of my loves hell.  I have no idea how to study, since no method I ever heard from my friends ever worked (which I can now atrribute to ADD), and now I *really* have to study if i want this, and it's killing me that I just can't. The wall is more appealing that the books they give us!  Please, if you have any tips for studying and actually not getting consumed by fear and distractions, share!  Thank you in advance! ;)   **TL;DR - Newly self-diagnosed ADD 19yo needs tips for studying so she wouldn't flunk first year of college and have to go home and give up completly.**  EDIT; There are very few experts on the matter in my small country, and all *four or five* of them are in the capital. There is only one institution and a private clinic. So I turned to the institution for a testing and am waiting for a reply. Will update when/if I get a response! :)

In the mean time I have been medicating with a small amount of ritalin when I can get it, Ethylphenidate and 2-FMA. The last 2 are research chemical drugs which although I cannot recommend work almost as well as Ritalin.   One of the aisles of investigation was a sleep clinic that found I had restless leg syndrome which was preventing me from sleeping properly. They offered me Clonazepam but I declined due to its abuse potential and long half life. **Has anyone tried any other methods of treatment and can they also include the medications impact on their ADHD?**  As an adjunct, if you have ADHD and seem to require 8+ hours of sleep and still not feel well rested then speak to your doctor about restless leg sydnrome.

My research seems to prove my suspicions, and it's a wonder I've gotten along for so long without an actual diagnosis.    At any rate, I'm curious about the medicine.  ADHD can't be cured, only maintained.  So I'm wondering if there's ever an end-point to the medicine.  Will there come a time when I'll stop taking medicine, or am I shackled to them for the rest of my life?  I have two other adult ADHD friends, and it seems they only take the medication when they need it.  Say, 2-5 times a week or so.  However, the medicine clearly states it is to be taken every day.  I guess I'm asking, "Do you take your medicine as prescribed, or as you feel fit?"  I haven't had a chance to ask my psych about this yet, and my next appt. isn't for 3 weeks, so I figured I'd ask y'all.  :)

By sharing here you will be held accountable (which is a good thing!) and we can help check in with you...**helping YOU get things done.**  *I highly recommend reading this longer post. If you want to skip it and just list what you want to do this week...go ahead. But, if you want a better chance to succeed and are willing to put a little extra initial effort in now...continue reading...*  *** ## Suggested ways you can participate:  * **Most important task** - Share one (or a couple) **HIGH-PRIORITY** tasks that you really would like to finally finish. Ex. Set a doctors appointment, finish assignment, clean the kitchen...whatever YOU think is most important.  * **Make a list** - Post a list of all the things you want to accomplish this week. (I highly recommend identifying the top 3 priorities.)  * **Feed your soul** - Sometimes by relaxing and having fun we have more energy to get more done. **List a couple FUN items to make your list more exciting.**  **Need/Want to copy last week's list *verbatim*?  Absolutely DO SO!**  *Those might be your keystone habits. Once you start doing those regularly you are able to do more. soon they will be automatic and you can put your focus elsewhere.*  *** By sharing your goal semi-publicly we can keep each other and **accountable**...and **celebrate in our small successes!**  By getting one small task done it creates **momentum**, **trust** in yourself, **confidence**, and you will feel like doing more.  ♥ ♥ ♥ **Never posted on Reddit before?** I welcome you to make this your first! ☺☺☺  *** ## Suggested Guidelines  * **Prioritize your list** One thing you want to get done (or start). What is the most important thing for you? (If making a list works best for you feel free to do that too!)  * **When would you like to finish OR start it by?** By committing to a date/time, we can check on your progress.  * **Edit your comment when done** - Come back and edit your comment when you have finished your goal. We can celebrate that (and then people won't check on you).  * **Small start** - Share what SMALL (under 10 minutes) commitment you want to make towards starting your goal. I found when my clients didn’t reach their goals 90% of the time they never started...this will help you break through the initial barrier.  *** ## Tips  * Your tasks/goals should ideally be S.M.A.R.T goals: **Specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound** * **Measurable** - Make sure you can be able to say YES I DID THIS. **Study enough** is not measurable. Study 2 hours is.  * **Break it down** - Instead of saying clean my room...it might help to say.

dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Question about med experience..;;;Hey Guys,  Thanks for having this subreddit, I've always been a little shame about having ADHD, but I guess through some therapy with my doctor, I've pretty much gotten over that.  I had a question about anyone's experience with meds.    I've gotten pretty good results with Ritalin, I've been diagnosed with ADHD-Hyperactive/Inattentive I guess.  Anyway I was on about 15mg but it got my pretty nervous/anxious, but it really helped me concentrate and study. My doctor was a little concerned about my being pretty anxious and on edge so he suggested I switch to Adderral, so I did.  I've been experimenting with dosage, and today I've tried the highest dose that I've tried so far with no luck, which is about 15mg.  I dont really get that concentration like I did with the ritalin, and it's pretty much just making my palms sweaty and feet sweaty that's all :(.  I was just curious if any of you guys had the same experience? Im probably going to ask my Doc if I can switch off of adderral.  Thanks guys!  tl;dr: ritalin made me nervous/anxious but worked well, switched to adderral, and at 15mg hasn't been helping.  need opinion if anyone else had the same thing happened? thanks  edit: my gf just told me that she noticed i've been pretty snappy with adderral too :(

My doctor prescribed me taking two doses a day, 20 mg each dose, in the morning and in the afternoon.  This means that I need to have 60 capsules for every month, but our insurance does not allow that (they cap it at 30 a month).  * A possible solution we came up with is to try to get the 40 mg capsules and have me take half a capsule a day, keeping with the 30 capsules a day that our insurance allows.  The problem lies with how I'm going to be able to take exactly half of the capsule in the first place.  * What we came up with is using a water bottle with volume measurements and filling it to a certain point.  We would then pour the contents of the capsule into the water bottle and have me drink half of it for my first dose and the other half later on for my second dose.  * Now, I'm not a biochemist or anything, but I'm aware that water is a universal solvent.  What we're worried about is that if we put the contents of the capsule in water it will denature the medication and its effectiveness.  This concern is mostly for the second dose, which would be sitting in the water for several hours until my second dose.  * **Here's my question: If you put the powdered contents of the medication capsule (Vyvanse) in water for extended periods of time, will the medicine cease to function?**

I've been given 18 mg of Concerta for the next 4 weeks. After three days I haven't really noticed any significant difference in my concentration, organisation or motivation to start my assignments.   I was just wondering what event, situation or task made you realise that meds were working for you?
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Question about ADHD symptoms;;;A friend and I have created a mental health Android app to help track symptoms and triggers for various mental health conditions (depression, anxiety, PTSD, etc.). It is in the earliest stages of testing. The app will be free, without ads, and open source.  Between the two of us, we cover a lot of the mental health conditions that might benefit from this kind of app. However, neither of us has ADHD. We want the app to be as broad and as useful as possible for all types of mental illnesses. So, if you were going to use an app to track symptoms of ADHD, their severity, and possible triggers/environmental factors, what would you specifically want it to be able to track? What unique things about ADHD would be helpful to you if they were recorded?  The idea is to provide the user with a log of symptoms and stuff while having reports that the user can print out to show to a therapist or psychologist.  Any suggestions you have are appreciated.  **EDIT:**  *Here's some info I typed out for someone in another forum. It should answer a lot of the questions people have brought up below.*  Thanks for the questions. I honestly appreciate them.  The idea of the app is just about tracking the info for the user. We don't interpret data. We'll have some statistical analysis and graphs about the data the user put in just for info purposes.  The app will have default symptoms that the user can use or not use. Most of the default list comes from personal experience and some of the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. There will also be the ability to add customized symptoms if what you want to track isn't in our default list.  All data is stored locally. We haven't considered putting a password on the actual app because people can have lock screens on their phones but I don't think it would be too hard to implement if there was a desire for for it from a lot of users. If someone is worried about losing his/her phone, I think a remote wiping app/function would be the best way to handle this because there is probably a lot of other data that the user would want deleted too.  This isn't so much a journaling app as it is a logging app. It allows someone to log symptoms or triggers as they happen. A person could do both written journaling and use the app (or not use our app if they don't like it or it isn't helpful). The main idea of the app is just a handy way to track what happens and when so the user (and his/her therapy professional if he/she chooses to share it) has access to the data that was recorded in real time.  The open source part allows anyone to see what happens to the data. It doesn't leave the phone unless the user tells it to. (The only way I can think of that the data could currently leave the phone is if the user chose to email one of the reports to someone or printed one of the reports.)  The idea for this app came out of my own needs and the lack of an app that could track everything I wanted to track. I used to use eMoods which is specifically for Bipolar users. I'm not Bipolar but it worked even though it was kind of "off" for my particular illnesses. After about 6 months of use, asked the author if he'd add one certain symptom to the tracking or allow users to change the default categories. He was very polite but said he didn't have the time to modify the app but might in the future. After looking at tons of other apps to see if one could work I decided the only way to really get what I needed to was to make my own. The idea was that it would be much more flexible and allow a person with almost any mental illness to track symptoms and triggers.  I talked with a friend of mine (also with his own issues) and we decided to make it happen. It was (and is) very important to me personally (paranoia being one of my little devils) that the app be transparent and not use any permissions it absolutely, positively didn't need. It won't display ads and it is open source and free. You're free to modify the app and/or compile it yourself if you like.  Obviously no one is required to use it and if someone just does not want their data on a phone then this wouldn't be the app for him or her.  The only personal benefit we will get from the app is the ability to track/log the specific symptoms of our own illnesses we want to track. We just tried to make it very customizable so anyone with any mental illness might be able to find it useful.  We both just happen to suck at graphic design and while we can create a cheesy icon, we'd rather it look decent. That's why I was asking if anyone had skills in that area who would be willing to make an icon for us.

I'd been having trouble focusing on my readings over the past academic year so I went and saw a psychiatrist. Based on an hour long visit with him where he asked me questions and observed my body movements (I like to tap/bounce my leg often) he concluded that I had ADHD. I am assuming it was a mild form of ADHD because he did not seem that worried about me. He said that I would get to pick the drug and the type of dosage (extended release, immediate) so that we could get a handle on the type of reactions I would have to the drug.  Based on initial research, I opted for Adderall (generic) extended release.   I am not really keen on taking medication daily, but mainly only when I have substantial amounts of studying to do (maybe once per week, and then regularly during finals week).   Did I make the right decision? I know that some illegally procured generic Ritalin extended release seems to be more effective for me than immediate release Adderall (at least I think it is, it's hard to tell what is working and what is placebo effect) and I have not yet had the chance to pick up extended release Adderall. WebMD seems to suggest (and some other sites) that that side effects are milder with Adderall. Random anecdotal sites seem to indicate it is also more effective.  Does anyone have any recommendations on which I should pick (outside of "try them all?"). This has been really nerve wracking and is seriously (ironically) impeding my ability to focus on my exams.

I'm currently taking ritalin. something like 15-20mg a day. Sometimes i feel like i'm a bit more paranoid than usual. I am also a bit more agressive. And the worst of all is that i'm really less creative than when i don't take medication.  But the point is that all of thoses types of medications are psychostimulant, i can't believe that they don't hurt at all.  So, is anyone affraid of being mad one day ?  (my english is bad, and i don't feel bad)

I was diagnosed with ADHD since i was around 7 (now 20) its been a constant struggle in school, family life, and relationships. I am very forgetful, constantly tired at times, and overall have a hard time keeping shit organized. I've been off ritilin since i was 10 so i cannot recall my medicated history. I have managed this far with people telling me im an idiot, your parents didn't do this or that for or to you, its all in your head, it doesn't exist, and so on. Hell the love of my life doesn't even accept it, but i grew to live with it and moved on. Sometimes i feel like i do have RLS as i constantly shake and tap my legs. I see this as a ventilation for excess energy when sitting. Anyway...I am happy to be here and happy to find others that understand.

I always felt nothing was "wrong" with me, and refused medications all throughout high school. The longer I go through life the more I see the effects of ADHD on my work, relationships, personal relationship etc, so I'm seeking help through a local psychiatrist.   I was tried on Ritalin and was allergic to it. I also tried Stratera and it made me so absolutely tired that I could'nt fight the sleep. Some of my closer friends let me try an Adderall from time to time and that works really well, but I am scared about long-term effects of Adderall. What should I stay away from as far as medications go? And what all can be prescribed for ADHD, and does each different drug have a different purpose or do they all treat the disorder in the same fashion?

Thanks to all of you in advance;;;This is the first subreddit that i've seen that actually has guidelines specifying how to properly format a wall of text. i think that's kind of funny.  I am nineteen years old. I am in college and doing well.   I've never been proud of my abilities to hold conversations, whether they be light-hearted or technical. Likewise, I've never liked the way I write. I think I come across as dull despite my accomplishments that say otherwise. That is one thing that I would love to change. I've processed so much information in my life but I feel like it is stored somewhere and forgotten like so many other things in my life (car keys, papers, children, etc.). I can never get it out in an articulate manner that might indicate that I'm knowledgable. And that's annoying.   Is this typical of ADHDers or is this just a part of me that won't really change no matter what medication I use?

I was generally discharged from the Air Force about three years ago, attempted a job in the same field I was doing while serving - Nondestructive Inspection. I failed at that and was fired, so now I'm in college. My wife and mother-in-law persuaded me to get tested for ADHD, so I did. Was diagnosed with anxiety and ADHD, so that's exciting.   Now I feel like I'm drowning; I've tried Ritalin, Adderall, and Straterra. The latter two seemed to work in their own ways, I was more attentive and less spaced out and everything seemed to be more manageable...   Until recently I feel like my life has fallen apart, though. I failed all four of my classes last semester, was fired from my job at the beginning of the semester and have yet to find another job... I'm not sure why it's taking so long to actually get a new one... My marriage is gradually degrading - my wife and I are constantly at one another's throats and we have steadily had less sex, it's been three weeks compared to the typical once a week deal...   Now everything is worse than before... I'm finding it impossible to get anything done and I'm not sure what to do to make it better, I don't mean to be this way... My wife swears I have to do something because she can't deal with this forever and she's afraid that when we have kids they'll be like me... My school is giving me a grace semester to get my GPA up, but my wife isn't sure if I should even bother. The college also says I owe 1500 bucks for not attending classes....  TLDR - my life is a mess and I'm making it worse. I'm not sure what I should do and I wish everything wasn't such a clusterfuck.
a36de9b8ad06ff3eafedcf5c2206fab129f8b55f7e5d85d911323bac3089e708;;;ADHD Survey;;;I'm doing a research project about abnormal psychology and it's interrelation to concepts. I'd like to invite all of you to participate in a survey which specifically targets ADD/ADHD. You do not need to have ADD/ADHD to participate in the survey. The survey will take between 5 and 30 minutes. Please answer honestly as honest answers gives us better data. Thanks in advance to everyone who takes this survey!  [Link to the survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/ADHDV001)  EDIT: I want to provide a bit of an update concerning the structure of the survey. I've addressed the concerns of the survey takers in the comments, but I'm going to re-present them here. These were the design goals of the survey:  * To maximize the presentation of instructions to those taking it. Frequently people with ADHD will skip over instructions if they are long. Additionally, conditionals were placed at the end of sentences to force participants to read the entire sentence. This is likely to cause frustrations as it inhibits scanning and skipping, but it was felt to be necessary.  * To be vague. Our theory is that difficulties with the concept of a situation create ADHD. Theses questions are set up so that people with ADHD will stumble while people without it will eventually be able to give a specific answer to it. In other words, we fully anticipate that people with ADHD will have difficulty understanding some of the questions or what we're looking for. That is, it's the result we're looking for.  * ADD was included because of the age ranges. It was not uncommon for people to be referred to as ADD but not ADHD in the 80s. Children who were considered ADD would sit calmly at their desks in school but not be able to focus. As a result, they were much harder to spot than children who were hyperactive.

Honestly I don't like any form of illegal substances, and think i really have ADHD-PI. Any help you guys can give me? By the way, he has add as well.

This morning I have had my most productive and distraction free day since being diagnosed,  and its not even 1230 here yet. First I was able to wake up early enough to get ready for work and eat breakfast; which I find is almost impossible most days. Even better, I just spent four hours strait working on a speech(I work alone as a security guard and have plenty of time to do whatever I want)  due Tuesday. I finished the outline and all I have to do now is practice it, which I have plenty of time for.  This is my third semester of college, but will be the first one I pass since being diagnosed last September. If you guys don't mind, ill write about how I did this and hear what you guys think of it. Thanks for reading and I hope everyone here has as much of a good day as mine.

We spent most of my childhood battling with my teachers about it which made school very difficult. I have been told I am also an intelligent person and have recently gotten a nice hold over my ADHD. But unfortunately I do have my days where it is extremely difficult to focus on even the smallest of tasks in front of me, with finals coming up I am worried that I might have one of the days where I can't focus. Is there anything you would recommend to help me focus on these type of days?
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;From what i've read, most ADHD posters are parents of children with ADHD, Do you realize how badly you are damaging your child?;;;I would like to start off by saying I'm 17, and I have ADHD. I took medication when I was in the 3rd grade and It did nothing to help. Have any of you ever though that perhaps your children do not actually have a dissorder? They simply have a personality trait that you don't like, but hey look the doctor will drug your kid into behaving the way you want them to! Take it from someone who knows, Giving your children drugs to calm down just makes them feel like crap about themselves. They feel like they're not good enough, not only are they no good enough for mommy and daddy, they are so bad that mommy and daddy hired a freaking doctor to "fix" them. My relationship with my parents has become a disaster since I was a child, while my two non-ADHD siblings have the normal relationship I would have had if my parents hadn't convinced me I needed to be "fixed" Yes children get hyper or distracted, it's who they are, but your missing the point that maybe the reason theyre not paying attention isnt because they can't, it;s because they just don't find interest in what is being said. It's basically the equivilent of if someone was to make you sit in a lecture on how to propperly floss for several hours, and tell you to be quiet, sit down, and shut up. When your kids get older and they find things that do interest them THEY WILL PAY ATTENTION. As I mentioned before when I was 6 years old I was told I had AHDH, and was put on medication when I was 8. I have been off my medication for 9 years and I am currently graduationg early from an accelerated magnet school with 4 year college BioMedical course under my belt. Your kid may not find Artificial Insemination and calculation hieght of a skeleton simply by the humors length as interesting as me, but they will find something interesting and give it there all. My whole live my parents always told teachers how I was too hyper and that they needed to "understand" if I acted out, in return teachers were surprised I acted like a normal kid. This has been the case with every other ADHD kid I have known.   Another small tidbit to add, back when you were children ADHD didn't even exist yet, It is something that was made up only in recent years that many believe could have an extremely negative impact on our future by giving millions of children low selfesteeem from a young age.  I know this is a bit of a rant, and it comes off sounding intirely like my personal opinion but I just hope you at least listen, millions of child "diagnosed" with this "behavioral dissorder" grow up to be screw up because of it. It is a well known fact that teens with ADHD are more likely to commit suicide, and I personally have been clinically depressed since the young age of 12 years old. It is not because of the ADHD, it is because we've were told they're not good enough from the start, without ever being given a chance.  More on link between ADHD and teen depression: http://womansday.ninemsn.com.au/lifestyle/family/8100758/teens-with-adhd-are-more-likely-to-have-suicidal-than-other-teens  TL;DR telling your kid there is something wrong with them and giving them medicine to "fix" them only implants the idea in their head that they are not good enough, and raises their chances of depression and suicide.

How long does it take to notice changes;;;I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was in primary school, and I was put on Ritalin until early high school. I had largely forgotten this, and only after taking an online test and talking to my Mum did I realise that it could be the cause for my constant struggle at work and with personal projects.  I have recently been rediagnosed and my doctor put me on Dexamphetamine 5 mg.  I have been taking it for 4 days now, and I don't notice anything.  The first day (Friday) I felt like I got some work done, but then I did nothing of value on the weekend, and here at work on Monday I still feel like I have to drag myself through it all.  Do I just need to be patient and wait, or am I expecting too much?   Edit: (Just read the label and fixed the spelling "Dexamphetamine").  Thanks all for the help, I wasn't sure if I was just being impatient, but now I know I need to talk to my doctor about the dose.  Thanks :)

I just stumbled upon this subreddit and I believe you might be able to help me a little. I'm seeking some guidance... When I was in 2nd grade I began getting really frustrated because I didn't understand anything and would throw things in class and at home. My parents did all the appropriate testing and I was diagnosed with severe dyslexia, ADD, and other learning disabilities. My dad refused to let his kid be on medication, but they did send me to The Schenck School in Atlanta for 3 years to help teach me how to learn with my disabilities. I am so thankful that they did this because otherwise I doubt I would have even graduated high school. I even managed to graduate with a Bachelor of Science from a well known university. (The only reason I made it through college was because I bought Adderall illegally.) I am now almost 25 yrs old and working at a bank. Until recently, I thought my dyslexia and learning disabilities were my biggest challenge, however after doing a little research on adult ADD/ADHD I've realized those symptoms have taken over my life.   * I have a difficult time concentrating on things,  * I zone out a lot,  * I have poor listening skills,  * I have absolutely zero reading comprehension skills,  * I procrastinate,  * I'm very impulsive,  * I don't have much self-control,  * I most definitely have addictive tendencies,  * I really don't do well with frustration,  * I can't sit still for very long,  * I'm easily flustered and stressed out,  * I can be irritable,  * I'm hypersensitive to criticism,  * I have a sense of underachievement,  * I have a temper,  * I have very low self esteem,  * I'm insecure,  * I can't make decisions,  * I get bored easily,  * My brain never stops thinking of random crap, and  * I definitely have hyperfocus (a tendency to become absorbed in tasks that are stimulating and rewarding).   Now that I am an adult and can choose what I do with my life, I'm considering attempting to get an Adderall prescription. I, honestly, don't know how in the world to go about this. The one thing I know is that I perform so much better at life on Adderall. If I had a prescription, I might even try for grad school.... Do you, Redditors, think I would be a candidate for a prescription and, if so, what is the world is my next step? A doctor? A Therapist? A Counselor? I just have no idea...  **TL;DR** I was diagnosed with dyslexia and ADD at a young age and am battling with it as an adult. Do you think I am a candidate for an Adderall prescription? If so, what do I need to do?  Thank you for your input!

It causes me to basically lose all appetite. I can easily go a whole day without eating. However, recently I've been trying to workout and get in better shape and build muscle which means i need to eat more but im having a lot of difficulty. Does anyone have any tips or suggestions?
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;I need advice.;;;Hey r/adhd, let me introduce myself first. I am a 17 year old guy who was  diagnosed with ADD when I was 11. Pretty much, I don't know what to do, concerning going back on medication. I stopped taking adderall when I was 15, I hated the way it made me feel. I never had an appetite, it made me feel like a zombie, and I was embarrassed about the fact of taking it whenever I ate at lunch. Ever since I went off the pills my grades have been slipping, I try my best to focus in school but it seems like whatever I do they still go down. My grades were better when I took Adderall, but I can't decide if it's worth the downsides. I've talked to my doctor and he thinks if I take a lower dose then it might help a little bit, but I'm just not sure. What do I do Reddit? Do I finish my graduating year next year without any meds, or go back on them and become an emotionless zombie and probably lose weight? Thanks for the help.  TL;DR Don't want to go back on pills, but grades are going down. What do I do?
5b919d94f00d7923d87e63f83bc6646bbeadf6df68bfd1eb8f4c66bef041ab1d;;;I'm graduating from high school in less than a week..;;;Last summer I was diagnosed with ADHD and was put on adderall. This school year I've gotten the best grades that I have throughout all of high school (I held at least a 4.0 average each semester this year) and I scored a 1950 on the SAT without studying.  I'm going to college next year, and I honestly don't think I would of gotten in unless I had been given treatment. Just thought I'd share that with all of you. I'm really proud at the moment.   tl;dr I brag a little bit about overcoming ADHD and getting into college
02c4fe3f651537108e5a6824cd3fdfee04bc4fbe9831d804b34bfd94b6827aed;;;Eating problems anyone?;;;I have a problem when i dont take adderall. i have to eat constantly just for the sake of chewing. i even started crying one time because i started eating paper because i had forgotten my medicine and it was too late to take it. i have to eat constantly. sometimes chewing gum helps but if there isnt any around i have a serious dillemma. i even wrote a short horror story based on it called "The Fat Man" about a man who begins to eat everything in sight. does anyone else have these problems?
42a6b031be4e1415039d4d1e11d8d7fb38aeddb05fceb62590bdfb8843e70921;;;So I have a couple of questions for those of you not taking medication.;;;I was diagnosed by my doctor with ADHD right before the Summer of 2011, in my Sophmore year of highschool. I am now finishing my Junior year this following week.   Once I was diagnosed, my doctor put me on some medication (I forget which), and so I took it over the summer and a little bit into the beginning of my Junior year. To say the least, I absolutely hated it. I became a mindless zombie, I couldn't think at all. I was so used to have so many thoughts running through my mind at blazing fast speeds, and then suddenly nothing.   When I looked at an object, I didn't go off on weird mind tangents ending with something completely unrelated. Nothing happened when I observed said object. I was completely unmotivated to move or eat, and ended up losing about 14 pounds becoming about 120 pounds, looking like a zombie. The time I was taking it during school, my grades were horrendus.   So because my grades were never terrible to begin with, I stopped taking it. Since then I have gotten back on my normal physical activity schedule, and am now at a good 135-138 pounds. My grades are exactly where I want them (straight A's, except for a B in Spanish, but that's just because I can't deal with two languages in my head.) and I just did my SAT with a score of 1800 (A lot higher than I was expecting, with a goal of 1700).   So basically my question is, are there other ADHD people who don't take meds, but still function perfectly fine? I almost feel better with my ADHD than without it. Sometimes it does get pretty extreme and I can't focus, but most of the time I can harness it and multi-task relatively well. As for excess energy, I usually try to workout more to release it, but of course I still move around in my chair A LOT. I also fiddle with random objects when sitting down.  I just want to hear other people's stories, and if anybody else has terrible experiences with medication. Also, does anybody else feel like their ADHD is a gift, rather than a curse? I don't think I would be as interested in the many things I am interested in, if it weren't for ADHD. I also feel like I can harness my energy and multitude of random ideas into doing great things. I am happy with ADHD, and it results in me never being bored, because just sitting there and seeing where my mind takes me is always an adventure.   Sorry for the long post, but it's something I've always wanted to ask other people with ADHD. I don't know anybody else with it, and I just found this subreddit so I thought I'd ask.  tl;dr Has anybody else had horrible experiences with medication? Do some of you feel as if ADHD is a gift, instead of a curse?
c0b70fdca67847f68580cc4351b7818ce4aa9e936908a8e0f63083726cef9ad1;;;Question about Adult Adhd;;;I've always believed I've had Adhd. As a kid I would always give teachers problems, and have a very hard time staying focused. Im in University now, and I do fairly well, but my grades for classes that require paying attention to the lecture are significantly lower, despite me being there. I try to pay attention but before I know it Im off on a whirlwind of though tangents. At work Ive always had a hard time learning things, because usually it required listening attentively. It makes me feel stupid and humiliated that Im usually one of the last people to catch on to things.   Anyway, I have an appointment set with my doctor friday, but Im kind of afraid of how he will react. I guess Im afraid that It will turn out that I dont have it and look stupid. So I guess my question is, what are the main characteristics of adult ADHD? For those diagnosed later in life what were the defining traits?
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Alternative ADHD treatments based on empirical evidence. ;;;I don't personally have ADHD, but I am very interested in attention research and always seek ways to improve my attention. I am also conducting some research on ADHD and self-control.  I recently found this subreddit and was quite surprised at the emphasis on medication. While medication seems to be the primary mean to address the symptoms of ADHD, we don't know the long-term outcome, but the general notion is there is little positive change.1. In addition, medication is known to be associated with cardiovascular problems among other negative side effects. 2. Don't get me wrong, I think medication can be a matter of living life happily and suffering. But this is just the mean by which our society decided to deal with this problem most effectively.  There is a lot of research currently done on ADHD little of it is utilized in therapy. I will try to highlight some key alternative treatments to ADHD that don't involve medication and usually result in long-term changes. Some of these things require personal interest to address your own problem which may be difficult as ADHD is associated with poor self-control and difficulty maintaining behaviors that go beyond instant gratification. But I hope you will see this as an avenue to become less dependent on medication, take things into your own hands, and seek long-term positive lasting changes.   1. This may be very obvious but it's critically important to address this issue first. Nutrition! Improper diet, deficiency of nutrients, food additives and allergens have been linked to ADHD. 3,4,5. If you know you are not eating properly alter your diet. Make sure you are getting your fatty acids and minerals! Nutrition is not likely root of the problem but you can't expect your mind to function properly without having a balanced diet.   2. Second point is just as obvious but also very important. Exercise! It's good for you in general. While human brain only represents 2% of total body weight, this organ uses almost a quarter of all the bodies energy supply. Not only do you need to make sure you have adequate energy supply for proper functioning, you also need to have good metabolism. There is plenty of evidence to suggest regular physical exercise promotes concentration, well being, alertness. Recent evidence suggests benefits to ADHD population as well. 6. Also recent research started looking at ADHD as a disorder of inadequate self-regulation. 7. There has been several studies done to support the idea that physical exercise improves self-regulatory capacity over many domains including regulation of attention. 8. If you know you lack exercise I would recommend an aerobic routine. I was surprised how much better I was able to concentrate just by doing a 30 minute jog 3 times a week.   3. Meditation is another good alternative. There must be dozens of scientific papers suggesting meditation as a mean to improve impairments due to ADHD. 9. Although it may be only applicable to a subset of ADHD population  there are many benefits to reap from meditation. go to [http://www.reddit.com/r/meditation](http://www.reddit.com/r/meditation) to get more acquainted with this practice.  4. Working Memory Rehabilitation Programs. Working memory has been associated with attentional functioning. Individuals with low-working memory capacity (sometimes due to traumatic brain injury) may benefit from these treatments the most. You can see if you are part of this population by engaging in working memory games you can find online. If you are deficient in working memory, you can do [Cogmed](http://cogmed.com) rehabilitation program it's pricey but its based on empirical evidence and produces long lasting improvements in individuals with ADHD. 10. If this is not feasible at the time, recent research has looked at effects of dual n-back working memory task on ADHD population which showed significant improvements by engaging in this task 30 minutes a day 5 days a week. This task and associated research is available online for free at [http://brainworkshop.sourceforge.net/](http://brainworkshop.sourceforge.net/)  5. Finally Neurofeedback. I can see on the right hand site of this subreddit that it's considered non-empirical alternative to ADHD treatment. But there are a lot of scientific papers on the topic now with support of its effectiveness!! Here is a site with overview on neurofeedback research: [http://www.addcentre.com/Pages/ADHD-NFB.html](http://www.addcentre.com/Pages/ADHD-NFB.html)  I also want to say that these treatments may be done in combination and immediate cessation of medication is unnecessary. The purpose of these additional treatments is to reduce the dependency on medication, and seek long-term psychological changes.   Apologies for grammar/spelling.  References:  1. Benedetto Vitiello.

I practice mindfulness meditation, walking meditation, metta (loving-kindness) meditation, and many other forms. Sometimes guided. This has really helped me notice my thoughts and judgements, see them as an observer, and see how random our minds really are. (I could write for hours on meditation alone so I will just answer specific questions).  **Yoga has allowed me to get in touch (and forge a stronger connection) with my body and mind.** I started yoga initially just for the stretching aspects. My knees hurt so bad I was about to get MRI's done on both and my lower back had a lot of pain. After doing yoga for 2 months my knee and back pain has disappeared. I used to live from the neck up (in my thoughts). I had little awareness of my body and often hurt myself by pushing too hard exercising. Yoga helps bring the body and mind together and work in a more fluid way. I now want to become a yoga teacher and teach it to groups of people afflicted with Aspergers, ADHD, or other similar disorders. *** ##ADHD Coaching For general questions about ADHD coaching I highly recommend you view what [Nancy Ratey says about ADHD coaching](http://www.nancyratey.com/adhdcoaching).

We plan for the next week. * Coaching typically will cost over $200 per month. * Throughout the week I will do whatever I need to do to support you. If you want me to email you daily...great! Text reminders?   An ADHD coach understands the ADHD mind and places an emphasis on time management/awareness, setting various reminders, and helping the client discover a system which works for them.   As a coach I believe the client is fully capable and has all the answers. I just ask questions and empower them to discover the power inside themselves. Once again I can go for a while about this but it will be easier for me to answer more specific questions. *** ##Influence of yoga and meditation  **Meditation enabled me to discover the present moment and see things in a clear way (not filtering my experience through my thoughts).** I started meditating on the breath just for the concentration benefits, but soon noticed an explosion in awareness. I practice mindfulness meditation, walking meditation, metta (loving-kindness) meditation, and many other forms. Sometimes guided. This has really helped me notice my thoughts and judgements, see them as an observer, and see how random our minds really are. (I could write for hours on meditation alone so I will just answer specific questions).  **Yoga has allowed me to get in touch (and forge a stronger connection) with my body and mind.** I started yoga initially just for the stretching aspects. My knees hurt so bad I was about to get MRI's done on both and my lower back had a lot of pain. After doing yoga for 2 months my knee and back pain has disappeared. I used to live from the neck up (in my thoughts). I had little awareness of my body and often hurt myself by pushing too hard exercising. Yoga helps bring the body and mind together and work in a more fluid way. I now want to become a yoga teacher and teach it to groups of people afflicted with Aspergers, ADHD, or other similar disorders. ***  ##My blog ~~I haven't blogged since I discovered /r/add.~~ HA! I just wrote an impromtu blog post to break the streak. Didn't want to point you all to an apparently abandoned blog...I will hopefully start posting there more often. I already wrote an article written on procrastination (6 months ago on the importance of just starting/part 2 will be about finishing) but I haven't written the last couple sentences.   I am not much for self-promotion but here is a link to my blog and some other ways you can follow/keep in touch. *** ##Follow/Connect with me Blog: [The Scattered Mind](http://www.thescatteredmind.com)  Twitter: [@brandonkochpc](http://www.twitter.com/brandonkochpc)  Google+: [My google plus page](https://plus.google.com/113650690829717847863/posts) *I plan to start being much more active here on the topic of ADHD (and life).*  ***  EDIT: Adding some info on ADHD to OP.  ##Possible new symptoms of ADHD specific for adults  * Some ADHD adults work hard at being organized but have little to show for results. This can lead to feelings of hopelessness and avoidance of organizing. * They don't live up to potential. Others may assume they could do better if only they cared more or tried harder. * They frequently miss turns and exits when driving, especially when going down familiar roads. * They have poor time management and/or procrastination which causes big problems at work and home. * They hyperfocus on an enjoyable activity to the point where other activities are forgotten or ignored for longer stretches of time than planned. * They have a tendency to miss pieces of conversation or be briefly tuned out. This may or may not be visible to others. * Is often easily distracted by extraneous stimuli or irrelevant thoughts.  * Often makes decisions impulsively. * Often has difficulty stopping his or her activities or behavior when he or she should do so. * Often starts a project or task without reading or listening to directions carefully. * Often shows poor follow-through on promises or commitments he makes to others. * Often has trouble doing things in their proper order or sequence. * Often has difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play activities.  * Often has difficulty organizing tasks and activities. * Often more likely to drive a motor vehicle much faster than others.

I am 19 years old and have always had good grades (B range).  anyways, back to the real question how long did it take for everyone to finally get diagnosed and medicated?
5216584582efcef65f13eb5c615176db5284dd67a49e4faa95d2e7b808b6215c;;;I just finished reading Dr. Barkley's Book, "Taking Charge of Adult ADHD" and have to share this.;;;http://www.amazon.ca/Taking-Charge-Adult-Russell-Barkley/dp/1606233386/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1338893370&amp;sr=8-1  Here's the book.  It costs 13 dollars from amazon.  **If you have Adult ADHD**  This is the book for you.  This will help you with job choices, school choices, and how to control your life (and btw, it even recommends that you can put down the book after the medication chapter, because most who get medicated see such a massive improvement on their life that they self correct the behavior)  On top of that it doesn't put everything on the disorder.  It literally says "not everything you do is because of ADHD"  which is a relief because I'm so sick of reading stuff of people saying "I AM THE NEXT STEP OF EVOLUTION BECAUSE I HAVE ADHD AND IT GIVES ME POWERS TO "HYPERFOCUS""  **If you don't have ADHD and don't think it's real**  It will pretty much insult your intelligence, and explain it to you in simple terms how your actions give people low self esteem  **If you have ADHD, but Don't think medicine is the answer**  It will explain to you why ADHD needs to be medicated and how a MAJORITY of people have seen massive improvements with medication.    Also this book will crush your self pride if you think you are better for not taking the pill.  **If you have ADHD, take meds and have no idea what ADHD is and no idea what the meds do**  I find a lot of people so far that I've met in real life through support groups or through reddit/other forums have very little knowledge of what they are up against.  If you want to know the truth buy this book.  I honestly hope people here read this book.  I'm gonna be pretty blunt and honest.  I have no use for this forum because its mostly become a place where people think they have it and ignore many good threads about the science behind it.and skills used.to help.deal with the diagnosis., I only pop in here once in a while to point people in the right direction, and to correct people when they say some garbage information.  I was one of those people that once I got up to my proper dosage everything started to make sense and wasn't hazy anymore, and I started to have that little voice enter my head that was helping me think before I did anything, and actually made me recall past events.    So in conclusion.  Stop posting garbage information about ADHD is a gift, and that medication is the devil, when there is a MAJORITY of people who see AWESOME results on it.

I don't know if it is because i did'nt do sport last few days or if it is because of the effect of the ritalin.  I feel like if i was very angry, at the limit of rage (but i am not actually angry). This is disturbing.  Like if everything was shitty, like if all the things were more boring than a hell of boredome. Something like a lack of nicotin, but stronger.  I take methylphenidate since 3-4 years but i've never felt agressivity like this.  Therefore : bad food interaction ? Lack of sport ? My brain is melting ?
1410563d5e46ddd35303dea11bb0f6e19f3a1ca6fc405c83aacdf1d83f9a3f66;;;I've been making graphs! [methylphenidate];;;[See? Graphs.](http://i.imgur.com/mZfC9.png)  [Graph 2 - wears off sooner](http://i.imgur.com/xZoqD.png)  (**edit**: graph updated to have units. whoops)  Context: I can only get the 10mg IR methylphenidate pills, as opposed to any of the extended/sustained release stuff - I was diagnosed about three months too late, thanks Australian rules saying XR/SR is only subsidised if you're diagnosed at &lt;= 18.  Taking an IR every four hours isn't quite optimal, though, since it gets a bit crash-y and it's somewhat uneven and basically just not ideal.  So I wondered what the graph would look like if I started with a 10mg IR, and then had 5mg every two hours after that. That's the blue; the pink is 10mg every 4 hours, and the yellow is the data straight from the PI for 10/10.  [it's obviously not perfect; I got the data from the PI and just subtracted the time-shifted first peak from the second peak to get what it might look like if you'd only taken a single 10mg; then added half of that on every two hours.]  tl;dr very rough graph of methylphenidate plasma level estimates for 10mg every 4 hours vs 10mg then 5mg every 2 hours.  Gonna give this a shot and see how it goes. [and yes, I have the psych's approval - don't try this at home, IANAD, etc.]
e02f957a2566c3073c0c3a07fe9f9dd53fc12be84db66084bc3fe5ba201100eb;;;I don't trust my doctor, and I'm having heart pain. Can I get some advice?;;;I was diagnosed with ADHD-C 2 weeks ago by a psychologist in Dallas (Davisson Clinic). The testing wasn't too extensive but I was diagnosed with ADHD-c (I was expecting it anyway, been diagnosed before but needed to get back on medication).  The psychologist seemed relatively smart, but I only spoke with him for about 5 minutes, and he told me he'd put me on Adderall and sent me to the doctor in the building. Within the first 5 minutes, I knew this doctor had no idea what he was doing. I don't mean to sound like an arrogant airhead, but it was just very obvious. He gave me my Adderall prescription of IR 10mg with the instruction to start with 5mg 2x/day and increase dose by 5mg every two days until it felt like it was too much.   Anyway, at about a week on it (and on 15mg) I started having chest pain and discomfort. I went back down to 10mg and it persisted. I called the doctor and he said to just stay on 10mg until it goes away, and if there was an emergency I could take an EKG.  I'm not sure what to do. I don't feel like anyone is taking the time at this place to make sure I'm being treated well. Everyone just says to keep taking it and ignore the side effects. Am I over reacting or should I seek out a different doctor?

But when we did a short interview over the phone, I mentioned that I take Concerta, and he said it may disqualify me.  I am just curious as to why this may disqualify me; I have the utmost respect for the armed forces.
c9457c6133ef28aed6e22309913a07a125c2ddb81c395ef5d997fad094113dc0;;;ADHD and relationships;;;I'm new to this subreddit, and glad I discovered it. 25 M here, diagnosed at 16 with ADHD, auditory/visual processing disorder, and generalized anxiety. I'm happy to report I have a great job, supportive family and girlfriend.   However, I've been having issues with my relationships lately and I suspect that ADHD and my other learning disabilities may play a role in my behavior. I sometimes feel that I have missed certain social cues that everyone else has managed to pick up on. I was wondering if anyone else has had similar issues, or may have general advice or resources.   To simplify, I will break down my observations into a few bullets, and I hope others can relate.   *I find myself much more careful around people I don't know well. I'm more reserved and tend to be shy and mask my true personality. But, as I get closer to people, I find myself being comfortable and I let my guard down. Here, I become more socially unaware. I say things that are unintentionally hurtful, thoughtless, stupid, or embarrassing. I hate the cycle, and it causes me to distance myself from others to avoid the embarrassment.   *I seem to have trouble with intimacy and romance. I feel love, but I seem to be unaware of how little I show it. I often forget or miss something that would otherwise be thoughtful. It's as if I need to make a "to do" list of how to be a good boyfriend.   *It takes a long time to adjust to from one social situation to another. If conversation quickly changes topic or emotion, I seem to have trouble keeping up. For example, moving from a joke to a serious discussion, or moving from a confrontation to a resolution.   **TL;DR New to this subreddit, mid-20s guy who feels that ADHD/LD/anxiety has negatively affected his ability to socialize and maintain relationships and would like some general advice or resources in this area.**

The trimester before I started, I got the highest GPA I have had since starting high school, a 3.64.  Accomplishment:  Third tri, about a month and a half before I started taking meds, I was off to a really bad start. When I started taking meds, I was at a 2.5(somewhat due to assignments I missed due to a trip but were entered as zeros before I made them up) and by the last day of school I got it up to a 3.71 which is the highest grade I've gotten in highschool. Two classes that were both F's turned into A's, and I scored two standard deviations higher than the class average on a college class final.   Now in summer I'm off meds and feeling great, but I'm very pleased with my recent academic accomplishments and the hard work that I put in to achieve them.

I was recently diagnosed with ADHD-PI which is (one of the) major reasons behind failing.  Any advice on explaining the effects of ADHD to a possibly non-receptive committee, relevant information I can give them or other's experiences in similar situations?

[Doctor Who spoilers up to these episodes within post];;;I remember before diagnosis, watching the three part finale piece by piece. Even years after watching it, I could still remember one thing in particular--the Master's comments, on the sound of the drums. The never-ending drum beat, I *knew* what he was talking about, if not in a literal sense. I must have rewatched twenty times, and I even named my first build "the Master"--I was young, after all.  But that call to war--it echoed with me. Even then, when I was young, I knew that calling, but I never quite made the connection, not until more recently when I watched it over again. The Master's drumming is that drive--the drive deep within, a core part of my being that creates the constant momentum that I feel at home within.  Do you feel the same way?
9448cbae92fd00294414525d2b03a7eadf8a6356749afcf07733ba5f770f6d76;;;Utilizing technology to increase productivity;;;So I've been pondering this conundrum over the past week. All this technology that surrounds us day in day out can become so distracting and detrimental to our wellbeing. I recently purchased an android phone, which means I'll basically always be connected somehow. What if we could utilize it to make us more productive? Using apps to our advantage to remind us of things that need to be done, and helping us plan put our day so that we don't find ourselves on Reddit at 5 in the afternoon when we had an assignment due today?   I'm aware that there is already a plethora of apps capable of doing this for us. Does the community here know of any amazing ones that could help us become more productive?   I've realised that my current predicament is not one that I am content with. Without some sort of drastic change, I'm not going to achieve anything amazing in my life. If I find a way to plan out everything I need to do for the day, and by plan out I mean plan out *meticulously* maybe i can manage to finally do what needs to be done? I realise that apps themselves aren't going to put the effort in for me, but a lot of the time i find the problem to actually be that I don't realise I have a shit to do. If I'm reminded constantly (by myself!), and I find the motivation to get off my butt and complete the task at hand, who knows what is achievable?   It's late and I'm rambling quite a bit, but I hope everyone can understand what I'm getting at.

You will be held gently accountable (which is a good thing!) and we can check in with you...helping YOU get things done.  *I suggest you read the whole post -- you* can *skip it and just make your list, but you’ll usually be more successful if you put in the little extra initial effort and continue reading....*  *** ## Choose the participation method that works for you: * **Most important task** - Share one (or a couple) **HIGH-PRIORITY** tasks that you really would like to finally finish.  *(Ex. Set a doctors appointment, finish assignment, clean the kitchen...whatever YOU think is most important.)* * **Make a list** - Post a list of all the things you want to accomplish this week.  *(I highly recommend identifying the top 3 priorities.)* * **Feed your soul** - Sometimes by relaxing and having fun we have more energy to get more done. **List a couple FUN items to make your list more exciting.**  **Need/Want to copy last week's list *verbatim*?  Absolutely DO SO!**  *Those might be your keystone habits. Once you start doing those regularly you are able to do more. soon they will be automatic and you can put your focus elsewhere.*  *** By sharing our goal(s) with this understanding community, we can keep each other **accountable**...and **celebrate our successes**, large or small!  **Don’t forget to return for [Win Wedenesday] to flaunt your successes!**  ;-)  By getting one small task done it creates **momentum**, **trust** in yourself, **confidence**, and you will feel like doing more.  *** ## Suggested Guidelines * **Prioritize your list.** One thing you want to get done (or start). What is the most important thing for you? (If making a list works best for you feel free to do that too!) * **Add a finish OR start deadline.** By committing to a date/time, we can check on your progress. * **Edit your comment when done.** - Come back and edit your comment when you have finished your goal. We can celebrate that (and then people won't check on you). * **Small start.** - Share what SMALL (under 10 minutes) commitment you can make towards your goal.  *I found when my clients didn’t reach their goals 90% of the time they never started...this will help you break through the initial barrier.*  *** ## Tips * Your tasks/goals should ideally be S.M.A.R.T goals: **Specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound** * **Measurable** - Make sure you can be able to say YES I DID THIS. **Study enough** is not measurable.  Study 2 hours is. * **Break it down** - Instead of saying clean my room...it might help to say, “Clean room for 10 minutes or pick up trash in room.” * **Write it down elsewhere** - Sticky note by computer.  Google calendar.  Agenda.  Write it down so you don't forget.  Our working memories are flaky.... * **Start small...build up slowly** - We want to build on small successes so committing to cleaning your entire house might be a bit too much to handle.  Pick a room (or a task like ‘pick up dirty laundry’)  instead. * **Want to study for 2 hours a day?** *Commit to studying 30 minutes to make it easier on you.*  *** ## Examples from previous weeks: * Unload the dishwasher. * Bike commute daily. * Study daily. (I suggest breaking this down into a number of sessions of specific length.) * Plan my week. * Call to set up appointment / make payment. * Confess to my SO about the ADHD. * Work out at least twice. * **Start** *[something]*. “Spend 5 minutes on writing my paper.” * Launch company website. * Brush teeth twice daily. * Submit med school application. * Visit mom. * Work on resume. * Do yoga. * Resist the urge to quit my boring job.  *** ## *It’s now easier to respond!  Just copy/paste the below into your comment.*      ## Daily Habit / Procrastinated Project / Soul-Feeding     * **What?** -     * **How much time?** -     * **When?** -     * **Potential Obstacles?** -     * **Check in on me? When?** -     * **Small Start** -     * **Reward** -     * **Something fun you want to do this week** -     * **Daily Habit** -  *** Daily list template, if that suits you better.      ## Monday --       * Item     ## Tuesday --     ## Wednesday --     ## Thursday --     ## Friday --     ## Saturday --       ## Sunday --    *** Don’t forget to **brag about your accomplishments in Win Wednesday** on Wednesday.  **Celebrating/acknowledging your wins is just as important as actually getting stuff done.**  *** **TL,DR: Share what you want to accomplish this week and how you will do it. Having people check on you via Reddit is extremely helpful!**  ## Oh, and lysdexia strikes again, yay.  And has to be in the un-editable title and I didn't notice until others have posted... =3
a4cc84c8cd78bffdcefeedb3fda409fb639ba4e429c29aeed53f355d4dbee0e5;;;ADHD and impulsive "workaholism", any tips?;;;I was recently officially diagnosed with ADHD-inattentive type and prescribed Adderall, although the symptoms are nothing new and now I just have a name for them, and medication and professional help to try to manage them.   I am seeking some advice from you fine folks on work-life balance and what you could consider to be impulsive workaholic-like behavior. I work as a social worker for children and families, providing case management to anywhere between 12 and 18 families at any given time (16 is typical). One of the major problems I have is that, in my line of work, it is IMPOSSIBLE, even under the best circumstances and for the most efficient time-managers, for all of your work to be completely done on a daily basis. You will always have to leave something for tomorrow, and there is a seemingly endless variety of essential job duties both in the office and in the field. Consequently, because I am forgetful about things and unsure if I will ever get to them if I left them for later, I impulsively tackle tasks the moment I notice them or think about them just to be sure they get done. This causes me to be late to client appointments, skip lunch nearly daily, to work later than I wanted to, to neglect other less urgent but more important tasks, and to feel overwhelmed by the sheer number and variety of job functions I am responsible for. Also, home and social life suffers for it because of the stress and long hours. House upkeep and my marriage suffers because I get home so late and I'm wiped out, and I sometimes skip social functions because I get caught up at the office.    I have tried putting into place several time-management schemes to help control this behavior, setting aside blocks of time to do specific essential tasks on a regular basis so they don't pile up and create crises later, writing to-do lists, etc. However, with phone calls, Outlook, an open floor-plan office, and intrusive thoughts about other stuff that needs to get done too, my attention shifts away from the tasks I had originally set out to do that really needed to get done, and onto stuff that is important but not urgent and could have been dealt with later.  Any advice on how to get this under control is most appreciated, especially what has worked for you if you find yourself in a similar situation.  **TL;DR: I get distracted from work by other work and end up working too late and too many hours without getting the really important stuff done, and it's affecting me professionally, socially, and personally. Time-management and organizational schemes tried thus far have proven no match for the distractions. Advice is appreciated.**
68ff9785f49c89c1956715bac4f50f1b4624cd7e08c34ff7fe51a144459209dc;;;Questions about past visits with psychiatrist;;;Earlier this year I started seeing a psychiatrist about ADHD, potential diagnosis, and treatment.   This was at a university clinic, and I accepted working with a psychiatrist in-training. However, after 2 appointments, I was told that they couldn't diagnose me, because my case was not severe enough. This is based on my past academic record (3.7 gpa in my 3.5 years of college), and the symptoms I have described.   Instead, he (and his supervisor) insisted that my social development was severely lacking, and that this was the problem leading to my issues. I did mention that I had very little motivation to find friends/relationships, have only few friends, am introverted, and am lethargic in general. However, my social development isn't a problem for me, even though he insisted it was.   Through 2-3 more appointments, I insisted that my difficulties concentrating were problems, but that I was content with my social life. At this point I asked how many cases of adult ADHD they are treating - he mentioned two. In the end, after I said that I was fine being a person on the asocial side, he told me straight up that I should find a second-opinion, and that medication-based treatment for ADHD from this clinic was out of the question. The whole ordeal lasted 3 months.  Now, I am graduated from college, but I still believe (contrary to the psychiatrist's opinion) that medication-based treatment for ADHD can  help resolve the issues I have with concentrating, staying focused, motivated, and vigilant.  Couple questions:   Could the fact that this was a clinic in the university medical center deter psychiatrists from diagnosing new ADHD patients who are students? Is this common?  Am I able to ask for written records made by the psychiatrists?  Are they right, or should I seek a second opinion? Now I am hesitant about talking to a psychiatrist, could I just ask my physician to prescribe medication? What should I tell a doctor next time to convince him/her that it will help me? (I have already figured out that it does in fact help me)
52ac301fc2cd0f32fbf54c89ee7fed3f33a1e40cb24841f84769a651f9058443;;;How should I explain my medication history to a new psychiatrist?;;;I know it's kind of a boring topic so I'll try to be quick.  I was diagnosed with ADHD in 2009, I think. It was my senior year of college.  I had some issues when it came to getting in touch with my psychiatrist so after a couple of months I found a new one.   Psych #2 was a learning hospital type program, so I had some sort of graduate student psychiatrist being overseen by a doctor. It basically amounted to me showing up for prescriptions. Around the Christmas before last, they stopped accepting insurance and I couldn't afford it otherwise, so I stopped going.   Now it's been a year and a half without medication, and I've since moved to a new state, found a new job, and in August I'll have new health insurance.   How do I explain the gaps between treatment?  It was a rough year and a half without meds. I basically procrastinated with finding a new doctor. I don't want them to think I can function well without meds, because while I get by, every day is a struggle. I also don't want to give them the impression that I'm "doctor shopping".   Should I just get a new diagnosis? I'm hesitant because the first psychiatrist just said I had ADHD based on my experiences, I didn't do any testing. The second doctor just got my records from the first one.   Anyone have any insight?  Similar experiences?  Thank you!

Anyone else have similar experiences. ;;; My journey with figuring myself out: I'm not diagnosed with ADHD, however ever since freshman year of high school (I am currently a Sophomore in College) I have been doing gradually worse in school year by year. I started having anxiety and depression. I thought I was also just lazy (maybe I am) so after being very desperate I saw my doctor. He told me to see a Psychiatrist and prescribed me Abilify. I've also had blood tests done and everything was normal. I felt much worse on it. So I sought for help at my University Center for Psychological services and I was recommended to have a sleep study done. The Psychiatrist at my Uni also recommended this. Fast-word to June this year (took a while for my insurance and appointment for the sleep study) and I'm sleep disorder free. My next step is to now see my Psychiatrist again as the Psychologist who I was seeing for counseling has left the University.   Did anyone else have trouble getting diagnosed with ADHD, did it take a while? I'm really hoping the Psychiatrist doesn't make me get more testing done as school is starting soon.   I'm almost certain it's ADHD, the symptoms and experiences I've felt are just so similar in my opinion. I mean I now know there's no disease that's causing me too lose focus or trouble concentrating. I know it's not a sleep disorder. It's not depression as I never thought of hurting my self, maybe just a little sad due to my low achievements or making mistakes all the time. I know it's not GAD as I have never had a panic attack, just simple anxiety school related. I also have social anxiety, I tried to have a relationship once but I just lost interest in her and it was hard to manage and pay attention. I also had horrible anxiety driving (like worrying how close a car is next to me). Now that I think of it it's hard for me to adapt to new things in general.  I don't have a feeling where I want it to be ADHD, but the evidence and research I've done greatly supports ADHD-PI. I'm not saying that my research surpasses the education of a Psychiatrist. I'm usually a shut in, I hardly ever go out. I have never went to a party, I don't drink alcohol or do any drugs. I also don't smoke. Yet I still do bad in school. I used to do good and I was recommended for GT and Honors classes going into High School, I guess things just got overwhelming. Now I'm stuck doing poorly in College (I luckily got into a decent one). I also understand medication is not the only treatment and it's not magic, which is why I'm also seeing an Academic Counselor to help get organized.  So my main question is when going to the Psychiatrist should I write something up why I think it's ADHD? Including my life experiences? Will that be helpful? Any ideas on how I can also facilitate a proper diagnosis?   Thanks guys, sorry for the long read and grammar issues I'm writing this up at 5 in the morning with a fever (saw a doctor for it will be fine in a couple of days).

Don't want to say too much, but the discovery honestly changed my life for the better. Self destructive thoughts went away.  I'm European, no idea what it's called here but I got Concerta and could put away my antidepressants. The latter made me gain weight and Concerta suppressed my appetite for a bit, so I finally lost the pounds overweight I had. Happy happy happy. Year later. Completely lost concentration, eating like a pig all day (not gaining though), and the only thing the meds did for me was controlling my motorical dysfunctioning. (As in life-ruining clumsiness, I always broke everything and fell upon/over everyone and everything) Ritalin..Adderall? I guess, worked, but in bouts, and the rebounds were so bad and it worked so shortly that I could only take that to prolong the effects in the afternoon. Rebound would cause great depression though.   Now I'm on..medikinet? Don't know American name, again, sorry! Works 7 hours. Mild same side effects as concerta, but works strongly. Need to take it two times a day. When I'm on it (like with concerta first) I can handle everything, my noradrenaline levels are fixed, I can DO things and REMEMBER things and I'm finally not being bullied in school.  I can't help thinking that it's awful that I rely on meds SO BADLY, and it changes my whole personality at that. Meds = happy. No meds = depressed. How do you handle that? How do you say to people, "well, yeah I can do that...wait, 5PM right? Hmm, by then I probably have gotten my second round of methylfenidate and my neurotransmitters will work, so I think we could meet then. " What if this will decrease in working on my concentration as Concerta?  Sorry for the rant, it's hard to find people with ADD in my daily life. (Besides the family I inherited it from, but they're fine with always losing everything)  **TL;DR: I feel like a failure without meds and my personality changes completely in rebounds and at random. How do you deal with being two-faced? I'm scared these meds will decrease in effectiveness as my previous meds. How do you deal with this?**
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;What meds to take?;;;Hello, a bit of backstory. I got diagnosed with ADHD when I was about 5 i think. Im from Australia. I has been on dexamphetamine for 2 periods in my life and both have ended with major depression. It turned me into a zombie as well. The second time when I was in charge of it, I actually became addicted to it and would often take 4-5 times the prescribed amount. It was terrible.  Im off it now, have been for 3 years, its great. My problem is im trying to juggle full time work, full time university, and depression (yes im very badly depressed again). The depression comes from a few things but part of it is knowing I can do so much but at the same time I cant. I feel helpless when it comes to completing anything. I havent wanted to go back to meds because I became addicted to them last time but I really need them to get my life on track.  I guess Im just after some guidance and/or suggestions on what to take.  Also, havent seen anyone yet, still kind of scared to. Guess I just dont want to look weak maybe... Thanks for any responses :)  EDIT: Sorry for the bad grammer its late. Also discovered this subreddit about a week ago and have been lurking ever since, the support on here is amazing.

[post medication update];;;I was recently diagnosed and posted about taking my meds for the very first time. I am on 1-2 10mg tablets of adderall per day and have been for the past few weeks. During my first day on medication I was much more focused and ended up cleaning my room and doing my laundry [detail post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/usc45/is_this_what_being_normal_is_like/)  Since the last post I have started my summer internship and things are going amazingly well. I am exceeding everyone's expectations for what I am able to accomplish, as well as the speed and quality of execution (They were already pleased with my work quality before meds). I have been told that I am awesome by everyone I work with on a daily basis, which is great.  Even more, as of now I have two pending job offers, both with the potential to start before I even get my bachelor's.   What's even more:  * I go to sleep at a reasonable hour, meaning I get enough sleep.  * I am so much less stressed and actually enjoying myself at work.  * I am much more able to nap if I need to due to my thoughts not racing as much. * My ability to articulate my points has improved. * I even look better. When I am on medication, my sinuses are less clogged, which helps with allergy-related eye puffiness.  The only downsides I can think of are having to drink more water to stay hydrated and, if I forget to ask for decaf in the morning, I feel uncomfortable. I basically feel like everything is buzzing. It is weird because caffeine on it's own makes me tired and adderall on it's own makes me calmer and slightly more subdued.   TLDR: I feel like I am finally becoming the person I want to be.

On Monday July 2nd 2012, I was sworn into the United States Marine Corps. And it is all too fitting that Win Wednesday falls on the 4th. Although I was never officially diagnosed with ADD or ADHD, it was pretty clear to me that I suffered from some form of the two. Waiting down at the MEPS(Military Entry Program Services) was long, boring, and mentally painful. But I did it, I buckled down long enough to focus when I needed to between the hours of 7 AM until around 5 PM. I did have a lot of trouble focusing on the ASVABS, but I did get an 86. Overall I am proud of the attention I gave my Liaisons, the Doctors, and the officers in the building. Hopefully my control will get even better while I wait to graduate high school and get ready for boot camp. I am 17 years old, and I am in the Delayed Entry Program for the United states Marine Corps! OORAH and Semper Fidelis. PS Happy Independence Day!

I'm curious, how exactly could someone like me (who was diagnosed as a kid) get back on ADHD treatment?   To give some background, I was on ADHD treatment starting somewhere between 5 to 7 years old (I can't remember the exact age, may have been later) and stopped around 14. Since then, despite trying to ignore the issue, it turns out I'm having a lot of issues that are often ascribed to "ADHD", and I think it's about time I get back on treatment.   But..., I'm not sure how I'd actually go about that. I have insurance (though it's in the middle of being renewed, so I have to wait until I get my reinstated letter), but do I just go to my primary care physician and say "Hey, I have ADHD, give me meds!", do I need to provide documentation I was diagnosed? How do I go about this?  Thanks
a1e952e6cc74fbfa365fc069f9fe220a703e88925abb586ee16093b89ab185ad;;;Quality problem;;;I have been on Adderall for 4 months and have reached a stable dose of 30 mg xr and 30 mg of regular for the afternoons. Now that i can focus and pay attention I am experimenting with different methods of making the best use of my time to get done what i need to, keep on task, and still have room for  hobbies and enjoyment. The quality problem I refer to in the title is that I feel a great deal of frustration in learning this skill.  I am 34 and I know this is something I would have learned much earlier without ADHD. I feel quite juvenile right now.  I can empathize too a small degree with those who have suffered a trauma that wiped the slate clean and now have to relearn everything. Has anyone else experienced something similar?

I'm unable to accomplish anything long term. I've really screwed my life up to the point that I can't afford medical insurance to go to the doctor. I can't afford doctors care out of pocket and I've already screwed that up because I owe my local doctor's office money from my last visit that I can't afford to pay. I can't hold a job and I'm unable to maintain any kind of relationship with anyone because I can't focus. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was a child. I'm not sure if that's why I can't focus as an adult or incapable of completing any long term goals. I think I may need some kind of meds to fix or maybe just cover up the problem so I can focus and get things done. I've really wasted a lot of my life and am almost at a point where I won't be able to earn enough to retire. I've notice the wear and tear on my body and realized that I won't be able to work forever. I also need things like health insurance so I can go to the doctor if I get sick instead of just sitting at home and waiting it out. We don't have a free clinic anymore which they wouldn't help me with my ADHD problem. They said I needed to see a specialist whom I owe money.   I try so hard to make myself focus but it tires me out. I end up being mentally screwed half way though the afternoon. Then I just sit there in a daze for the rest of the day not able to do anything. I've always been this way. I just don't know how to get help when I can't afford it.

I know it's hard for older folks to get a job, especially when they aren't very familiar with "new" technologies (she doesn't even want to learn the cash register), but it's even more difficult for her because she has ADHD.

The new weekly /r/ADHD thread for introductions and questions about being diagnosed/starting medication/whatever!;;;As /r/adhd increases in size, we find ourselves in a critical stage of development. We as a subreddit can either fall into a pattern of repetition (allowing our community to get bored/overwhelmed with repeated topics/questions), lost in a sea of memes/pictures/questions/noise, or we can proactively shift the tides towards making /r/ADHD a perpetually flourishing community based on scientific findings and personal discovery.  *** ## The main purpose of this thread:  * Provide a place for people to **ask simple questions** which may not need a dedicated post. * Give people **new to the  /r/ADHD community (and there are thousands of you)** a chance to say hello and share a bit about their strengths, struggles, and dreams.  *** We decided to start a new weekly thread on Fridays in an attempt to consolidate the frequent “beginner” questions and introductions into one place. After discussing this in our [/r/ADHD chatroom](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=/r/ADHD) the conclusion is that we must **address the increase in basic questions posted in /r/adhd.**  Of course, anyone can post a question, but this thread is especially geared toward people who **think they might have ADHD, have just been diagnosed, have questions about whether to medicate (or not), or to ask about possible side-effects.**, etc.  ## Also, if you’re new to our little community, (or even if you’re not and you just want to do this anyway!) this is the place to say hello!!  *By the way, these threads are going to help build /r/ADHD’s FAQ page, the current version of which can be found [here!](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/ADHD)*  **So, to get to the point of this thread, allow me to introduce /r/ADHD's introductory and basic question thread!**

Help?;;;I felt stimulated, that's for sure, but mostly as if I had ingested a large amount of caffeine. I was restless later in the day, like my head and body couldn't unwind. I've also read others mention the constant *sigh*ing (as if short of breath), and I experienced that too.   I've done a little reading on d- and i-amphetamines, but it still seems unclear. I'm wondering if i would benefit from a different medication (like Adderall XR?) that would give a more direct impact on concentration, rather than mood. Help?  I'll take all this to my psychiatrist, but I'm hoping for insight from those who have experience with both, or multiple, medications.  **TL;DR** The dopamine rush on Vyvanse was noticeable, but didn't impact my concentration like I'd hoped for. Could another medication/dosage be a better fit? HALP!!!  Edit: for clarity.

Today was the EEG.  Augh.  Poor little guy.  He sobbed and had a total melt down in the parking lot before going into the Neurologist's office for the test.  The nurse and I had to bribe him to get him to cooperate.  Normally I don't bribe but in this situation I wasn't worried about my parenting, just felt sorry for all the stress he was under... you know?  He had the EKG last Friday, the MRI on Tuesday and he was so brave and didn't cry once!  Not even when coming out of the "sleep" they put him in for the MRI.    **I feel crappy that I didn't think to prepare him more** or pay attention to how all the stress was building on him.  This last test was just the straw that broke him.  But he did it!!  And I am so proud of him.    **To the poster who encouraged me to give more positive feedback to him while he is putting forth effort to accomplish things:** I made a point to tell him through all of these things how brave and proud I was of him for trying to lay still, or hold his arms down or whatever the nurse was instructing him to do.  Thank you for that advice!!  We are using it moment to moment and I can see his confidence building.  **The Neurologist prescribed today Focoline RX 5mg.**  And I got it from the pharmacy tonight so we can start it over the weekend.  I want to be sure we have time to notice any adverse reactions to the meds while he is with us for the full day.  (During the week over summer months he attends a Taekwondo camp while we are at work.)   **So this is my list of things I am looking out for, let me know if I am forgetting something:**  Increase in occurrence of his tick  Loss of appetite  Vision change- honestly no idea how I can figure this out **anyone have a tip of how to tell if his vision is blurred?**  High blood pressure- we did purchase a blood pressure machine but it didn't come with a children's cuff so we are ordering that.  They say "Unusual Behavior"   **what in the world does that vague statement mean?**  **Any other tips?**  I am mixing the meds in a spoonful of applesauce and am aware I should tell him to swallow and not chew it because chewing destroys the controlled release of the meds.    An aside: I started reading Russel Barkley's book,  **Taking Charge of ADHD, Revised Edition: The Complete, Authoritative Guide for Parents**  And I am finding it very informative.

Turned into a Boss on the video games. So focused 3. Immediately had better short term memory 4. We went shopping and didn't say "keep up!" Once! 5. He ate really well! I hope this lasts 6. He put together a toy that normally he would have given up on 7. At the swimming pool he had more positive social play with the other kids and was included 8. He remembered lyrics to a song I had no idea he knew. 9. He colored a coloring page at ruby Tuesdays and really paid attention to staying inside the lines, so seems improved fine motor skills! 10. At first when the meds kicked in he was cranky and emotional, a full stomach of milk and chicken seemed to help his mood. 11. Bed time. Yet to come, hope It's okay.  Edit to update:  Bedtime was fine.  He did a bit more self soothe talking to himself but fell asleep just fine and slept all night.  Getting him up to use the restroom was hard because he was sleeping heavy but he went right back to sleep.  This morning for breakfast he had a protein bar (by the way the breakfast threads on here are very helpful) and he is very calm this morning.  He is actually relaxing on the couch watching a morning show- and noticeably fewer tics!!  He is laying still, too and his body is physically relaxed.  This is something he could not have done before.  Also no tongue swirling today- not calling it chewing any more because I checked his mouth and there are no signs he was actually chewing, now we think he was swirling his tongue but it looked like a chewing action.  Thank you to everyone who has given me informative, useful feedback about ADHD as our family learns more.  I appreciate the support of this community.

I go to a IB school so next year is going to be hell, according to what I've heard. My grades have been pretty ruff for the past few years and I get special help for test and exams (mainly extra time), but grade not my only problem.  I have had trouble with have friends who "like" me. It seams no matter what group I try to change to I always am the one who people pick on the most. It has gotten to the point where out of the 7 people in my group only two consider me their friends. Anyway people don't seam to like me.  Now I think this is mainly because of ADHD, I don't know exactly because I have only had help with school. My dad is very repressive of my ADHD, he acts like its nothing and that I'm lucky that is i get the help with school. Since i have to chance and get anything to help with it what else can I do to keep my ADHD at bay. Or is he right and I just lazy. Please help. And one last note I have a feeling is my lift with friends get better my grades will get better.  TL;DR Dad does think my ADHD isn't bad, I do. Social life is crap, probably because of ADHD. Any advice, please?

You will be held gently accountable (which is a good thing!) and we can check in with you...helping YOU get things done.  *I suggest you read the whole post to be MORE successful, so put in the little extra initial effort and continue reading....*  *** ## Choose the participation method that works for you: * **Most important task** - Share one (or a couple) **HIGH-PRIORITY** tasks that you really would like to finally finish.  *(Ex. Set a doctors appointment, finish assignment, clean the kitchen...whatever YOU think is most important.)* * **Make a list** - Post a list of all the things you want to accomplish this week.  *(I highly recommend identifying the top 3 priorities.)* * **Feed your soul** - Sometimes by relaxing and having fun we have more energy to get more done. **List a couple FUN items to make your list more exciting.**  **Need/Want to copy last week's list *verbatim*?  Absolutely DO SO!**  *Those might be your keystone habits. Once you start doing those regularly you are able to do more. soon they will be automatic and you can put your focus elsewhere.*  *** By sharing our goal(s) with this understanding community, we can keep each other **accountable**...and **celebrate our successes**, large or small!  **Don’t forget to return for [Win Wedenesday] to flaunt your successes!**  ;-)  By getting one small task done it creates **momentum**, **trust** in yourself, **confidence**, and you will feel like doing more.  *** ## Suggested Guidelines * **Prioritize your list.** One thing you want to get done (or start). What is the most important thing for you? (If making a list works best for you feel free to do that too!) * **Add a finish OR start deadline.** By committing to a date/time, we can check on your progress. * **Edit your comment when done.** - Come back and edit your comment when you have finished your goal. We can celebrate that (and then people won't check on you). * **Small start.** - Share what SMALL (under 10 minutes) commitment you can make towards your goal.  *I found when my clients didn’t reach their goals 90% of the time they never started...this will help you break through the initial barrier.*  *** ## Tips * Your tasks/goals should ideally be S.M.A.R.T goals: **Specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound** * **Measurable** - Make sure you can be able to say YES I DID THIS. **Study enough** is not measurable.  Study 2 hours is. * **Break it down** - Instead of saying clean my room...it might help to say, “Clean room for 10 minutes or pick up trash in room.” * **Write it down elsewhere** - Sticky note by computer.  Google calendar.  Agenda.  Write it down so you don't forget.  Our working memories are flaky.... * **Start small...build up slowly** - We want to build on small successes so committing to cleaning your entire house might be a bit too much to handle.  Pick a room (or a task like ‘pick up dirty laundry’)  instead. * **Want to study for 2 hours a day?** *Commit to studying 30 minutes to make it easier on you.*  *** ## Examples from previous weeks: * Wash clothes. * Finish my math class early.  **Done!** * Eat! * Run 2k. * Don’t burn down my neighborhood.  (In re: fireworks, I hope.)  ;) * Apply for ONE job. * Send rent. * Remember passport, ticket, etc. for trip. * **Start** *[something]*. “Spend 5 minutes on writing my paper.” * List unneeded items for sale on eBay, CL, etc. * Floss * Clean my room to see the floor.  *** ## *It’s now easier to respond!  Just copy/paste the below into your comment.*      ## Daily Habit / Procrastinated Project / Soul-Feeding     * **What?** -     * **How much time?** -     * **When?** -     * **Potential Obstacles?** -     * **Check in on me? When?** -     * **Small Start** -     * **Reward** -     * **Something fun you want to do this week** -     * **Daily Habit** -  *** Daily list template, if that suits you better.      ## Monday --       * Item     ## Tuesday --     ## Wednesday --     ## Thursday --     ## Friday --     ## Saturday --       ## Sunday --  *** Don’t forget to **brag about your accomplishments in Win Wednesday** on Wednesday.  **Celebrating/acknowledging your wins is just as important as actually getting stuff done.**  *** **TL,DR: Share what you want to accomplish this week and how you will do it.

e6ae9d40f6c9ef93d20b049633efd54ffcccbb5b9059184401df9a6209217d2b;;;are all my other problems actually stemming from ADHD?;;;so i'm a 27y/o guy. i've been dealing with moderate-to-severe anxiety since i was 14 with brief breaks that were probably related to self-medicating with drugs and booze. smoking pot worked for a few years, drinking worked for a few years, now i take lexapro (prescription) and it totally helps... with anxiety. but, a lot of the major symptoms that i and my doctor attributed to anxiety are actually getting worse- like: - i can't focus on ANYTHING, which is not good since my job is being a music producer- (no, i'm not famous whatsoever, but have managed to at least make that my main source of income for several years with random temp jobs to supplement when needed...)... i can't pay attention to the tracks i get sent or the ones i am supposed to be making. its not like i don't want to work on them, i just open them and stare blankly at the program and space out then close the session to "come back to it later."   - i forget shit all of the time (my memory has never been stellar, but its getting worse and worse)  - i still have "brain fog" to some degree, but its less panic-ridden than it was before the anxiety meds.  - i can just sit and space out thinking about one random tangent after another all day but can't bring myself to do anything... i don't feel depressed, just like i am operating at half-speed and super indifferent even though part of me is like "dude get off your ass."   recently i was discussing this with a group of people and someone mentioned that my symptoms sounded like adult ADD. after doing some research, i am considering that as a possibility. what do you guys think? any advice would be greatly appreciated.

So i went to the therapist and he said that i was exhibiting signs of add/adhd. When he told my parents they refused to believe it. I have no focus, and i constantly get in trouble for doing stupid shit. I try to control myself but its nearly impossible.  I've gotten meds (aderall, ritalin) from my friends who have add/adhd. And they seem to really help. Im more relaxed, and more focused. I also smoke weed on the daily, that also seems to help (especially with my classes where creativity is key). So what I'm asking is , does anyone else have this problem? and if so how did you get past it?  tl;dr: cant get meds, impossible to control myself, any advice?

SUPER nervous about doc appointment.;;;They still aren't very supportive though, every time I mention the possibility of ADHD they literally laugh at me and mock me. I never thought it'd be my parents making fun of me, heh. It's quite harmful, but I'm more concerned with finally finding out if I have it or not.  I also found out that I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 5, I never knew. Apparently I took ritalin and it "didn't work" according to my parents. They were also saying that because I was diagnosed by a pediatrician that it "didn't mean anything, because pediatricians don't know what they are talking about"...The ignorance I have to deal with is killing me.  Any advice about the doctors appointment? I kind of know what to expect, but it's still scaring the shit out of me. It's not easy to admit that I can't function properly in society, and to do so in front of a total stranger bugs the hell out of me.   Anyway, thanks again /r/ADHD for helping me out, i couldn't of made it this far if not for your guys. Thanks so much &lt;3  TLDR: My parents are dicks, make fun of me for thinking I have ADHD. After 2 years finally convinced them to let me go in for a diagnosis, but I'm really really nervous about the appointment, is there any advice for the first visit?  thanks again
f73312a0d077f10ab8f1f387613faa2ea25cdb9ce867167b6aa5fbcb25d1ebc8;;;College says my doctor didn't provide *enough* info to qualify me for accommodation…;;;So there's a form to fill out and return to the college, which my doctor did. It asks about evaluation procedures, diagnostic techniques, dates of diagnosis and treatment, impact of diagnosis, GAF score, and recommendations.   My doctor completed the form, and I submitted it to the college, but they've come back and said that there's not enough information. I asked what additional information they need, and they couldn't specify. It seemed like a "we'll know it when we see it" type of situation.  Anyone else encounter something like this? How can I best advocate for myself in this situation?

I am so fucking excited to tell you **I FINISHED A BOOK**.  I haven't done this in years!!! I enjoy reading again!!!!  The book is [Driven to Distraction](http://www.amazon.com/Driven-Distraction-Revised-Recognizing-Attention/dp/0307743152/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1341864405&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=driven+to+distraction) and it's really helped me understand my ADHD.  I'm buying a copy for my dad so he can better understand me.  I was diagnosed with ADHD four months ago, tried Wellbutrin, didn't work, now on Zoloft + Adderall and it seems to be the perfect combination!!!  However, I still really need help **balancing my school and work life**  It seems like I always pile too much on myself but I like being busy...  Basically: Still have a few papers left to write that are due in a few weeks time Have some exams to study for.  How do I plan that out and prioritize that?  How can I fit this in with work and other personal projects / fun?  Is it ok to accept some amount of failure? Some points I know I can't get back but I still feel too guilty to start on stuff I can get full credit for.  I know it's stupid but some encouragement would be awesome.  **tl;dr Need help balancing school / work life.  How do I prioritize tasks and split up large projects?**
cd2277dbaed20f4c7e7ccf5f2c03a435b0a0f892af2500d127478d008fc7c518;;;Are you always tired? Near impossible to wake up?  ADD might not be your problem —Just found out today I actually have narcolepsy.;;;**TL;DR Narcolepsy is underdiagnosed, and can be misdiagnosed as ADHD. If you experience excessive sleepiness, look into it. I found out today that I am a narcoleptic, and it's the biggest relief I've had in this lifelong mental battle for social/academic motivation.**  EDIT: *Narcolepsy does NOT mean you randomly fall asleep all the time a la the movie Rat Race.  While this can be a symptom, it is not a defining factor. Narcolepsy is marked mainly by abnormal sleep cycles, which can be seen in a sleep study.  The ability to have vivid dreams during short daytime naps is a big sign of this.*  **My Story:**  I was always smart in school, but began struggling at about 8th grade, and had issues ever since.  I got diagnosed with ADD, and have been struggling with motivation issues ever since then. I've always had sleeping issues, but disregarded them as having an irregular sleep schedule.  **My new diagnosis:**  Recently I made friends with a narcoleptic who happened to be on the same meds I was on for ADD (Concerta). We got to talking, and her symptoms sounded identical to mine, and I was convinced I had a sleeping disorder.  I got tested, and was just got diagnosed today. *It was one of the happiest moments of my life. So many issues I've had in the past now have a legitimate cause, and I know I wasn't just being an irresponsible prick.* I now know what I'm dealing with, and how to proceed in the future.  While narcolepsy symptoms vary among patients, I'll share mine to help you recognize what lead me to get diagnosed.  **Here are MY symptoms:**  * **Excessive daytime sleepiness**  * **Vivid dreams even during short daytime naps**  * **Impossible to wake up** (my wife will have arguments with me in the morning trying to wake me, and I won't remember it.)  * **Wet the bed until 7th grade.**  * **Emotionally disinterested/never shows emotion, even if you're interested**  I've always been known for being very laid-back...almost *too* laid-back.  I'd never show lots of excitement of disappointment over anything.  * **Tossing and turning a lot during the night** This one I wasn't aware of until I got married and got kicked out of bed multiple times. (which I don't remember, but only know because I woke up on the couch and was told about later)  I don't claim to be able to diagnose you, but I know a lot of people in this subreddit are as frustrated with motivation issues as I have been, and you're looking for answers.  It's a rare disease (about 1/2,000 people in the U.S.), but it's often misdiagnosed as ADD, so I'd expect there to be a few unaware narcoleptics in this subreddit. Whether or not you have it, it's one more possibility to explore.  Edit: Gotta put in a plug for /r/Narcolepsy here.  We need more members!
80dca9497f08ec2f3c2cf0ac02dcb5a7f4a6756cc2da2c120aacf0f2c93a101e;;;How do I live within my limits? (tips or reassurance);;;I posted something a bit like this a while ago, but that was more venting, today I just have some questions.  I am a student, doing an independent course while living with my parents on a farm right now, but normally I live in the city and attend regular classes.  I have been treated, seeing a doctor, coach, have accommodations and what-not, but I still just can't get much done.  If I'm relaxed and I can make myself focus for about a total of two hours a day (usually no more than half an hour at a time), then I burn out.  I used to lock myself inside and try to force myself to work longer than that, but I would just end up stressed and able to do even less.  I am trying to accept that I can only do so much and must rest in between and not be too hard on myself, but two hours just isn't enough time!  I don't have time to even do one course, and no time at all for a social life (which I desperately want).  I'm worried I'll never be able to do a full time job.  So, I guess I have two questions:  Is it possible to gradually increase the amount I can focus in a day (what should I try for/hope for)?  If it doesn't get better, or in the meantime, how can I live in such a small time windows? Any jobs that could be good for me (for example)?  [Bonus question: does any of this even make sense to you guys?!?]  [edit]  I suppose it pays to stay positive, but it seems like we rarely talk about the ultimate consequences of ADHD, which is that we are going to have to give stuff up, and to do less than other people.  I spent the last few years thinking if I just work a little harder, I'll be able to do everything normal people can do (like taking more than one class at a time), but it doesn't always work that way.  Lately it feels like there isn't enough time, and I have nothing left to give up.
e69497c79aa4f810bde042bb878fd2ef55dd8322473611baa296387a22656c92;;;How much money has ADHD cost you? ;;;Medication and doctor visits are not the only cost related to ADHD. The thought of how much money I've lost because of late bills, forgotten fees, missing appointments, purchasing organizational tools that I never use, and losing stuff scares me.    My most recent blunder is carelessness with my expensive dental retainer/night guard. Instead of putting it in one safe place when I took it out, well, I didn't do that. Sometimes I took it out at the kitchen sink when I took meds in the am instead of putting in the case in the bathroom.   The retainer was a clear plastic color which, to be honest, i couldn't even see without my glasses because it disappeared into the background. It was missing. I looked everywhere. Then my stomach flipped over as I remembered scooping up paper and plastic grocery bags from the kitchen counter. I knew the retainer got scooped up as well.   A new one is costing $500.00! This time I'm getting it in PINK!   Do you have anything similar to share?
f420c4154b209abd4892b1b1541832e22b392cbf88b4a1eb658979e9b5e65a4c;;;I had my appointement with a psychotherapist. And I need to vent.;;;**First, thanks if you can read it all. If not, I feel your pain, there is a tl;dr :)**  Some weeks ago, I finally steped on my reluctance at every psycho-something doctors and decided to start a process to finally get diagnosed (or not!) with ADHD. I had a first meeting with a mental health nurse that was really perfect. He asked questions about me, my life, specificity on ADHD and me that could be and many other things. In short: I felt like I was finally taking a really good step in the right direction and that I was in good hands. Next step was to wait until I got to see a real therapist. (There is a waiting list, I'm in Canada and I can't aford private sector.)  And so today was that day. Conclusion : the psychotherapist doesn't see the need to put me on medication. And so I left saying "thanks for your time doc". But in the bus ride home, I started to feel... Weird. Something was not right. And I'm not really sure why I didn't figured that up when I was with the therapist, probably because I trusted her and her expertise but... I'm so angry at me not to have had that reflection while it was time !  I started to think about what we talked about. And I realized that for the hour we've been together, she's the one who made all the talking. It was like I was listening to a documentary on some sort of european women's vision of society... She went on and on, on the positivity of me going back to school. More then 20 minutes of this and her vision of society on the fact that people doesn't help people who want to study subject that are not seen as "useful to society" in general. Then I spoke a minute about the fact that when I dropped out of school before, it was because I felt I had no more of the extra energy to give to do task people do normally. She said "ok", and started to talk about money. An another 20 minutes or so.  An another 10 minutes of her explaining that my high blood pressure should be looked at more closely in a nephorlogist study (!!). And then saying theses dreadful words: « stimulants often don't give the expected results on adults. And I don't see the point on putting you on some. I recommend psychotherapy to start and reevaluate your relationship with money, and I'm writing a note in your file so your familly physicist take you to a nephrologist. » Then, like I said before, I just went away thinking that she know what she was doing...  I don't want to judge her or anything. She's the doctor. But, I feel like she just spoke and spoke, and didn't even tried to evaluate something that seems closely related to ADHD, to just to let me go. I'm just so confused. I was ready to accept that a doctor would say that he/she thinks I should't be said ADHD and/or not put on medication. But I didn't plan on having the feeling that she haven't even tried to navigate on the precise matter I was there to check.  I just... Don't know what to think right now ?  **tl;dr** I had my appointement with a therapist. She won't put me on meds, and I feel that she tried to diagnose anything but ADHD. Now I'm just totally angry at myself not to have had that reflexion in her office and trying to vent not to become lost in frustration.  **EDIT** Thanks to all who are replying. Your inputs are very appreciated.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Trying to decide whether to take a break from stimulants. I'd like to hear your input.;;;I was diagnosed with severe ADHD (hyperactive, mainly the inattentive type) in December of 2011. My main struggle is being able to focus on anything for more than 2 seconds and remembering things (this is really my most frustrating problem).  * Started on Adderall, 20mg/2x day. Adderall made me very hostile and on edge at all times. Stopped taking it in March 2012 * Began Vyvanse 30mg/day, and have bumped up to 40mg/day. At first it was a god send, now it is just causing problems. It also only last until 2pm when taken at 7am but moving up a dose would make the side effects worse. * However, last semester I got almost all A's, which is the best grades i've received in the last 2 years of college.   This is where my problem starts. I have a ton of side effects, and many other medical problems that are amplifying these effects.  Medical Problems:  * Possible thyroid issue, currently working on figuring it out. (showing hyper and then normal) - Bodily functions are already sped up, so taking stimulants make it feel like i'm going 100 miles an hour * Hyperhydrosis of my entire body - when my body gets going I sweat way more than normal even just sitting still in an air-conditioned office. * Severe SEVERE allergies/asthma - Breathing gets difficult, and shortness of breath occurs almost instantly. I also have food allergies, and my medication makes me nauseas unless taken with a starch, which makes me have to choose between which to treat.  * Sinus Issue - Headaches/Head Pressure is exponentially magnified.  Side Effects:  * INSANE dehydration to the point I get sick (I'm drinking about 2 gallons of water/day) Dry eyes, dry lips, dry everything. * Stress/Anxiety levels that are through the roof and wrecking havoc on my body. * Take 2-3 hours to kick in, and if I don’t eat a huge meal before I take it I get very nauseas. * Went from the sex drive of a 11 year old who just discovered porn, to rock bottom zero sex drive. * Getting more irritable when stressed, snapping at people, getting angry easily when it wears off. * I don’t take it on weekends, and those days I spend most time in bed or beyond fatigued.   I am seeing a therapist to try and work on my ADHD without medication.  Please share your experiences, suggestions, etc. I know I need to talk to my psych about this all, and I plan to when I return home, but I just want to get auxiliary input from those who have gone through similar things.   **TLDR: I have severe ADHD, meds showed a drastic improvement in school and I have 18 credit hours this semester. But the side effects coupled with other medical problems are too overwhelming. What do I do?**

I spent most of my grade school years feeling like an outcast because i couldnt act like the other kids. spent most of high school and college feeling like a complete failure because i couldnt put the focus on long enough to finish papers or homework. managed to get staggeringly high grades on tests but couldnt do homework. Now as an adult, I struggle at work almost every day to just keep focused and do the easiest part of my job which is the paperwork and I'm finally through with it. I need help, I want to stop this and live up to my potential. how do I go about finding a doctor who can diagnose and prescribe me the right medication?
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;ADHD, Anxiety, and Depression. Would benefit greatly from anyone's input!;;;I am a 20 year old male, currently taking concerta for ADHD and Zoloft/sertraline for anxiety and depression. I have a few questions concerning alternative medications and side effects.  SKIP  IF SITUATIONAL STUFF DOESN'T HELP YOU HELP ME :) First, I have been taking concerta (54mg x 1 daily) for about 2 years. Last fall was my first semester of college and I began having anxiety from my school workload and living in a small room with minimal privacy/relaxing space, which didn't do me much good. At the begging of my 2nd semester I started celexa to treat anxiety and also depression. Looking back at high school, I had minimal anxiety, and I believe I had a little more depression than an average person but nothing I couldn't clear with meditation. My current depression was induced by the following series of unfortunate situations all within 4 months: death of a best friend, suicide of another close friend, 15 year dog died, mother got cancer, grandma died, and the last and final (knock on wood) was my dads hospitalization and 2 surgeries for heart problems.  SKIP TO HERE  The celexa didn't help much and i just started the Zoloft. The concerta agitates my anxiety a little bit and I was curious if anyone has experience the same. Strattera didn't do anything for my ADHD. Would adderall/vyvance/focalin cause less agitation to my anxiety?   Can concerta with an SSRI have a negative effect since they both inhibit the uptake of serotonin/nerepherine? Would the alternatives be better or more therapeutic since it helps release dopamine? Or would it have minimal effect?  I'm open to any suggestions and thankful for any input!  I'm trying to ease the process of switching medications again and get things back to normal.
80dca9497f08ec2f3c2cf0ac02dcb5a7f4a6756cc2da2c120aacf0f2c93a101e;;;Is there any types of meditation you guys find are better or worse for ADHD?  Also, how to deal with discomfort during meditation?;;;I haven't been meditating for very long, only a couple weeks.  I ave tried a few different guided mediations, but am not sure they are working for me.  Some are too "spiritual" (all life is connected, and world of infinite joy type stuff) which makes me confused and/or frustrated.  My favourite is just focusing on a candle.  Trying *really* hard to just think about that and let other thoughts pass by.    I keep hearing talk about mindfulness, and that it is mindfulness that we are supposed to do instead of focusing on one thing, but whenever I try that, I get intensely uncomfortable and frustrated.  Usually, when I think about my breath, I feel like I am not breathing enough, or I am breathing too much, and I hate it.  Sometimes I can't completely go back to normal, unconscious breathing for a few hours, which makes me  a bit panicky.  I haven't heard anyone else say that, though.  Also, what should I expect?  What am I trying to achieve?  I thought the point was to strengthen my ability to focus, so I could do schoolwork more easily, or to increase willpower, but I am not sure if that is how it works.  Edit:  I guess, part of what I am confused about is what is "mindfulness" meditation.  I read a thing that said it was different from concentrating, and that it is mindfulness that ADHDers are supposed to do.  I would rather focus on a candle or one idea/picture than observe my body, and I'm not sure what the difference is.  Also, how is "watching my thoughts drift" any different that what I do all day every day?  If I'm stopping the thoughts, isn't that just concentrating, not mindfulness?
8e282250578947dc0f1fcabe8d3a35318855e3754cf40ccf82bbde279b379082;;;People that know things about adderall please read..;;;So I just got diagnosed, been taking 1-2 10mg ir for 4 days now. I haven't taken them later than 3 pm. My normal "bdetime" is 2-3 am. I've had insomnia type symptoms for the last 3 nights, and my stomach has been upset, even almost thought I would throw up while eating lunch a couple times. Didn't. But anyway, will the sleeping issues get at least a little better on their own? and should I be worried about chest discomfort or like shortness of breath? It could be like acid reflux maybe, also I might be a little low on blood sugar because it's quite hard for me to eat. And the last 2 days the positive mental effects of the meds have dulled a whole lot. Just looking for some advice, I feel quite shitty right now physically..   edit: should I maybe take a break tomorrow? or power through the beginning of medicating oh also, I hate the constant feeling of needing to burp, it's really uncomfortable and will that maybe stop?

I had some bills comming in but i had no money, and i wont ask my parents to lend me anything since i already owe them so much,(they can kick me out if they want but they dont) Now the bills are piling up and going to the enforcement officer...  I have no money, wich leaves me in debt, wich gets me depressed, when im depressed i hide, its not the first time i do shit like this, but i hate asking for help, my whole summer i havent had any money, it was my birthday recently so i hoped for a little money, but i guess people forgot, i dont blame them since i never have any money to buy people presents anyway.  So now my ID also expired so its not valid anymore, i dont have the cash to get a new one, so i cant get my medication, which i still cant get since i dont have any money, my psych wants me to meet with him, but i cant because i cant afford it.

What should I do?;;;Some background:  1. I pick things up, study them intently, and put them down somewhere around the house within 20 seconds. ALL THE TIME.  2. I run from place to place incessantly, even when it's not necessary at all.  3. I constantly get distracted by things like imperfections on a table, pens, pencils, windows etc. I can't concentrate on any one thing  4. On the subject of comorbidity, i have violent negative mood swings. Generally as a ridiculous overreaction to little niggling events.

I had a conversation with an individual with whom I work.  It began with this line:  ""for crying out loud - the file you copied to ***** can only be read by you.  losen up the file permissions and try moving the file from *********** back to ******"  This was the first words I heard from this person all day.  I didn't feel very happy about it, in fact I was pretty upset, so I decided to address it, albeit in a different way.   Me:  You doing ok, John?  John:  yeah are you?  Me: Yeah, I am doing fine. Just noticed that you seemed a bit upset in the AEX ticket and wanted to see if there might be anything else I can do to help you today?  John:  you gave the file permissions so tight you are the only one who can read it - no wonder it failed  Me:  I certainly hope you aren't assuming that I did that on purpose.  The system designates my permissions, so perhaps there is a command I can use to chmod files before copying. Also, it does it to varying permissions, it seems.  John:  no - but we have to think about what we are doing - if we copy files for a process to pick up and run - we need to be sure the permissions are appropriate  Me:  I apologize for forgetting to check the permissions after the copy and I'll try to pay attention to it in the future if that will help you out. John:  I don't like this discussion - I feel you are being patronizing  Me:  I am trying to help both of us out, honestly  I have a problem with something that is going on today and I am trying to work with you to avoid something like this from happening in the future. The reason I am doing this is that it is important to maintain a healthy working relationship as we will be colluding on many issues in the future. I hope you believe and understand this of me.  This is my problem that I am having, though, not yours. I just need your help in making it right. I am sorry if I have made you feel patronized as that was not my intention at all.     *end of convo*  I could have handled it better as I was, indeed, upset, but this is the second time I have attempted to use this method at work as outlined in The Dance of Anger:  A Woman's Guide to Repairing the Dynamics in Intimate Relationships (yes I am a man)  Very good book.

Where do we draw the line?;;;As someone who has studied brain science for over five years, I'm well aware of the issue that mental disorders pose in a scientific filter. What qualifies as a disorder, and what qualifies as an appropriate mental response to stimulus? These are the questions that I come back to time and time again, and I'd like to have a discussion in ADHD.  I've been diagnosed with ADHD since I was in elementary school, and yet there is one thing I could never reconcile with myself. I'm a firm believer in the concepts of will power and discipline, and yet those seem to be the problems directly facing those who suffer from ADHD. Now it is a scientific fact that will power and discipline can be altered and improved with practice; where, then, do we draw the line for ADHD?  At what point does ADHD stop being a case of laziness and discipline and start being a disorder? Is it a disorder when your actions make you unhappy and harm your life? Does that make any of the weaknesses that we succumb to as humans a disorder? To create a broad definition of disorder is to remove the ability to make mistakes. Nothing is a mistake; why would we do it if we knew it would harm us? Yet I think we can all agree that mistakes are a part of life and not a malfunction of the brain.   Where, then, do we draw the line for ADHD? What measurable context is there to determine that something is wrong? Perhaps a physical sign of an underdeveloped brain? I facilitate this conversation because I feel that this subreddit has become a place to discuss weaknesses and mistakes rather than the disorder of ADHD. So, r/ADHD, where do you draw the line? What, specifically, makes ADHD a disorder, and not just a conquerable weakness?  Thoughtfully yours.

Any alternatives work (vitamins, caffeine pills) that might help me get through.  ;;;Hello all,   First of all, this is a great and very helpful subreddit.  Next, hopefully this is the best place for this post.  I called my doctor to get my script written since he writes it for one month and I need to pick it up from the doctors office which is a city away ( live in Michigan but might be a national law since its a controlled substance ).  Turns out he is out for the entire week.  I've wanted to go to a different doctor in town but I haven't been diagnosed with ADD per se I just know that Ritalin has save my engagement and has landed me a great job in my field.  Now that I'm without meds for 6 days, is there anything I can do to help?  Will the pharmacy fill my script for a few days to tide me over?  Would I need to see another doctor?  Should I just make due and tide my brain with caffeine and vitamins?  Any help would be greatly appreciated. Important weekend as I'm the best man in my cousins wedding.  Thank you for your time.  Edit: Credit to my past self for saving Ritalin that made me jittery and occasionally nauseated.(Of course more karma to the people that posted helpful  suggestions! :) ).  Not anything I would take for an extended period of time but I plan on spacing out what little I have left and just making sure if it causes any side effects to stop and only take what is needed.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;So here is my story (I don't know if you care but oh well);;;Don't know if you care but this is what happened..   I did shit in school in elementary school, I had Us and Ds and that type of thing... I took ridoline and it got better.  Fast forward to 9th grade where I didn't take medicine. I got 6 B's on my report card and one of them was in band  Fast forward to 10th grade.. My doctor prescribed an expensive ass scam drug called intuniv and then I went from 6 B's to 0  Fast forward to 11th grade. I had a 95.5 average for the year and did little to no work (took picture of notes etc)..  Now I'm going into 12th grade with a 3.833 GPA (l0l) and I did shit on my SAT (1500 something; its a total scam). I also took some honors class in 10th grade (regular but i got honors credit) and 11th grade AP class etc. I took images of notes to help study because class is kind of boring but the medicine allowed me to fuck around in school, study notes on bus and bs and then get good grade. Also I started only the images thing when the 4S iPhone came out. Until then I just wrote and then struggled reading what I wrote but now even if the teacher doesn't allow image taking, I can write my best and take picture of what I wrote to study faster etc.   I'm not posting this for karma, I don't really care what you think but I'm just saying that it can help. You have to take it every day and it doesn't have any real side effects like I knew. (I gained weight after not taking anything for a year, but this didn't cause me to loose it because it had no loss of apetite.) I'm also pretty sure I have aspergers but I won't go and get diagnosed because it's a stigma and I would rather not know if I 100% have it or not.   Now I'm healthy, happy, and I like to feel smart in classrooms because there is a lot of dumb people etc in my classes and its fun being smartest in room because your parents can afford $1500 a year to pay for your grades etc.   Also I have no loss of apetite or sex drive (that I'm aware of) Pls share your story

About a year ago I decided enough was enough and came off all meds. Since then, I have felt a lot better but my ADHD has worsened. I am wary of going back to the Doctor's office but I really need to get this under control. Life is falling to pieces. I am not looking forward to the meds game where "let's try this one" is said at every visit. I guess I'm looking for input on what works best or things I can try before drugs.

As a kid, he could never pay attention in class; he got in trouble all the time for it. He was considered very bright by many of his teachers, but they all mentioned that he never tried. In middle school, my brother had special lessons with the principal just to practice his reading. All throughout high school, my brother never had good grades. He just barely graduated high school. Right now, he's going to an art college, but he's struggling there too. Just today he went to his school to pay his tuition last-minute, and was angry at himself because he missed the deadline, thus dropping all the classes he wanted. He also got a parking ticket; my brother insisted that we had only been in his school building for no more than fifteen minutes, but I'm pretty sure it was an hour. He also mentioned to me that he was getting very irritated when he was trying to teach his girlfriend how to bike, and was putting himself down for being so impatient. Also, he got another overdraft on his debit card.   His impulsiveness and forgetfulness really worry me, but I'm even more worried about how much more frustrated he seems to be these days. When he was younger, he had some serious anger management issues, and while my mom attributes it to puberty, I feel like he might just blow up again. He told me that he was getting irritated at everything, everyone - and that he had no reason for it (again he started beating himself up over it). He's been lashing out more these days, which is concerning because he's still working out often. Back then, working out made tremendous improvement on his frustration.  Sometimes I feel like anything he wants or does at the moment surrounds every part of his mind so that it leaves no space for anything else. My relatives always tell me how he's irresponsible and reckless. I know my brother doesn't mean to disappoint other people. It's sometimes hard to just try and understand why he can just forget to do things so easily, not prepare anything... but now I feel like it's starting to get worse for him, and I want to push him to the right direction and help before it gets any worse.   The thing is though, I don't know how to do that. My brother and I have spoken about him visiting a therapist (I haven't mentioned a psychiatrist), but every time I bring it up now, he just nods and says he'll do it, he'll do it eventually. He's never thinking about WHEN to do it though. He just tells me he'll do it, but I never see him plan it. And when I offer to find him help, he tells me he'll do it later, do it himself. He's holding it off, and I KNOW that even if a part of him doesn't want to do it, a part of him also wants to go. I think he had a bad experience with a psychologist in the past (where she gave him pills that scared him off), so I don't know what to do now. Is there anything I can say to him? Is there a way for me to let him do it now, instead of holding it off... because once he goes back to college this fall, I won't be around there to tell him. And I just want him to get help as soon as possible, and I know it sounds bad of me trying to push him to get therapy or whatever he needs, but I just hate seeing him fall deeper and deeper when I'm trying to hold on. Augh, sorry. I just really hate seeing my brother feeling bad all the time, I really do.   TL;DR - sort of a rant, sort of asking for advice. How can I help my brother go to the right direction? He's suffering from what I suspect is ADHD, but he won't bother going to anyone for help despite the fact that he tells me he will be.

d9af79581d049a2f1ba402de511ae6c465623ec43506587aa05f4ce137193982;;;Minding my Mindfulness.;;;Oh, hello!  Today, I'll do something different. I'll make a post, all for myself. Instead of hijacking everybody else's threads, I'll ask my questions over here :D  Now, as the title goes, this is about Minding my Mindfulness. What this means is that I want to learn to be more mindful of what I'm doing, where I'm doing it, and how long I'm doing it for. Most specifically, my talking. But I can also happily extend this to other things that lead me down the road of non-productivity.  What has caused me to ask you awesome folks in here for advice is my work situation. I've got an awesomely understanding boss that seems to shield me from a lot of flak I'd otherwise get because I sometimes get my priorities all askew, or I just otherwise don't do things in the ways that I should. And he listens to what I've to say in regards to my challenges, and helps me find ways to make things work for me. However, there has been a recurring item of concern that's been coming up in our regular reviews which has me frustrated.  I like to talk. And I can't always stop myself. Even when I know I should.  But we all like to talk, right?  I tend to go so long my throat goes dry, my medication wears off, and then I lose pretty much all control of stopping myself. We are talking up to an hour or two, sometimes. Working in a busy workplace, this is usually not a good thing. Especially when I'm stopping a colleague from working during this time as well.  So again back to my title;  * **TL;DR:** How can I become more mindful of my mindfulness? What kinds of processes are there that I can put in place to check myself regularly and to pull myself out of these damaging situations? I've been working pretty damn hard, both at work, and at managing myself. However sometimes it just isn't enough, which tells me that I've not got all bases covered.  Any help would be great, and I'll be sure to do better than my best to make this work.  And thanks for putting up with my text wall. I'd prefer to use more whitespace, but it won't let me :(
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;How to find the right dose for Adderall XR?;;;Hey guys I'm newly diagnosed ADHD at the age of 18. Didn't even know it but after months of doctors/counseling visits a Psychiatris made the diagnosis at my school. I also love how at my University I can visit a Psychiatrist FOR FREE.    Anyway I was prescribed with Adderall XR 20mg. I have a month to find the right dose and if it's working for me or not. I also have 60 pills. It is the Generic from Teva, orange capsule with M. Ampeth 20mg written on it.    Day 1: I felt great I took the pill at 2:30pm, a little too late I found out. It started to kick in around 3:30-4pm. I had an unusual taste in my mouth. I'm not sure what 'euphoric' means but I my mood was noticeably elevated. It was really life-changing. I was actually clear and at peace for the first time in my entire life. I could focus, was motivated, confident, and actually excited to clean. I never knew I liked cleaning so much as I cleaned my entire room including detailed organization. I had time so I took my fancy time to cleaning it. I noticed that was SIGNIFICANTLY more patient and the urges to do something else were gone. Like video games, didn't want to play them. I was doing one thing at a time and actually planning ahead ABOUT cleaning instead of just thinking of something else. Seriously I have never been this conscious in my life. I probably spent a good 5-6 hours cleaning it. I was also able to tutor my little sister without thinking it was boring. As for side effects I had ALL the minor one's listed for this specifi pill but I'm a strong guy and hardly notice them. It lasted till about 1:00 am and the. I was out like a light as I could feel the crash, tired and heavy eyes.    Day 2: Unfortunatley, I was sleep deprived today and had to go to work. I took the pill at 4:30am thinking the earlier I take it the better. Tried to go back to sleep and couldnt so I was working on 3 hours of sleep. I felt relatively good just not as much, felt much more tired and the effects and crashing were apparent at about 1:30pm.    At this time I needed to not get tired as I still had work to do, so I took another one and I couldn't believe the feeling. My body said "NO, NO, NO" but my mind said "YES, YES, YES." I can take pain, I could tell my body was hurting but couldn't care less. I actually wanted to work and stayed over an hour later, I work at retail and never do this. My boss asked why I was still here and told me to leave. There was little left to do anyway. At about 6-7pm I felt the Adderall was less effective and my body ached. I wanted to sleep but couldn't. I did my best to sleep earl and I did at 12:00am. I slept till about 9:00am. I also lost about 7 lb from Monday - Tuesday. Same thing with side affects. I was still able to focus just not as much and I made the conclusion that Adderall doesn't work too well when sleep deprived.   Day 3: I some up and could tell I wasn't on Adderall. I felt the ADHD back and was hyperactive. I couldn't focus and was greatly unmotivated. I too. The pill at 9:45 am. At about 11am I could notice an effect just not to a greater extent. I took another one at 1:30pm. From 2:30 - 5pm I was noticeably more motivated and was even more focused. I was focusing on details much more significantly. I could tell there was a greater effect. I think this was because The first dose and the 2nd dose were active. I could tell at 6pm it was less effective and and about 9-10pm I couldn't think clearly. At 10:30pm I felt the crash suddenly. It's amazing how I can go from active to tired. Same side effects.    Conclusion: Maybe my sweet spot is 20-40mg. I am considered obese, I'm a big guy 6'4" and 260lbs. Maybe I need a slightly bit more like 30mg?   How do I know I've found the right dose? Do I have a high tolerance where suddenley I have to increase the dose. I don't feel euphoric but my mind clears and the fog is gone. I'm motivated and can focus.   Thanks!   EDIT: I'm going to try 2 20mg XR pills and see the effects also I haven't found a straight answer but is the Brand XR better than the generic from Teva. I'm going to ask my Psychiatrist for the brand for next month.    EDIT 2: Okay clearly 40mg of Adderall XR is too much. I took 2 pills at 11:30am and it is now 1:30pm and I feel much tired and sleepy than this morning. I also feel very lethargic. The 20mg starts to kick in 1 - 1.5 and I know it does. It could also be that I took this 'Focus Factor' multivitamin, I normally do not take this. I took 6 as it said the recommended dose is 4-8. I also tried it to see what would happen. The bad thing is I shouldn't have changed two aspects, higher dose and multivitamin now I'm not sure which is the cause of no effect. I have heard instances where they can also cause the effects of Adderall to diminish. So I will continue tomorrow with 1 20mg pill AM and 1 PM. Then in about a week week see if 40mg helps or not. I'm actually seeing my pdoc on Monday so hopefully he knows.

I take my medicine everyday and I am usually pretty calm. But every now and then I have days I feel like I didn't take my medicine at all. I know that isn't the case. I have a strict routine I follow. Yesterday was one of those days.... My girlfriend even asked if I took my meds and if I was sure. Which I was.... I even counted to see if i need my refill soon.  It doesn't happen all the time, but it does happen. Is this normal? I take 50mg Vyvanse.

If I didn’t complete the work over the summer, I wouldn’t be able to return to school. But summer is long, and past failures are terrifying. So, for the first two months of summer, I didn't sink, and I didn't swim; I just floated. How can you choose a direction, when every direction seems to end with sinking?  With just over a month left before school, my dad picked me up from where I’m living to take me to where my family was vacationing, but after only three days of being there, he tells me he's taking me to his house so I can take care of the work I need to do, and then he'll drive me back. At first I panicked, but once I thought about it, I realized that it was as good a time as any, but my dad had been seeming unusually aggressive toward me, and I had concerns about trying to work with him stressing me out.  After a day to settle in, I started working, and spent the day re-familiarizing myself with the material. Once I felt my medication wearing off, I started looking into resources for ADHD, and came across the Edge Foundation's website, where I found myself reading all of the articles I could find. I learned so much about my disorder and the myriad ways I had no idea about that it affected my life. Most importantly I found so many tips for working with ADHD, and for the first time in a long time, I felt....hopeful.   I continued reading through their articles today until my dad came home for lunch and asked me how my work was going. When I told him what I was doing, he refused to listen to me explain how significant it was and how much it was going to change things, and accused me of procrastinating. It hurt so bad to have all of that hope I'd found be so trivialized.   A little while later, I tried to approach him to explain that while, initially, him being a hard on me had helped me start moving, him continuing to approach me aggressively about my work and berating me for not working like he thought I should be was completely shutting me down and leaving me feeling defensive, anxious, and emotionally exhausted. But he refused to change. I tried again to explain what had happened in the past and why I thought I could change things now, and he told me I wasn't disordered, I was just stubborn and prideful. Eventually I managed to get through to him that he was speaking from ignorance and got him to agree to educate himself. I sent him the Russell Barkley video recommended in this subreddit's FAQ, and a piece by Patricia Quinn on ADHD in girls hoping that once he had a basic understanding, I could start to reason with him.   He only watched the video before instigating another argument with me and used the fact that Barkley considers Predominately Inattentive Type to be distinct from ADHD to negate any part of the video I said I identified with. He then made me go through the DSM-V criteria for ADHD, argued with me on every symptom I felt I had, excluding only the painfully obvious, and told me I was being stubborn/not open to his argument any time I tried to support a symptom with my experiences or Quinn’s work. In the end, I still scored as ADHD-PI, but he just said he was going to research the symptoms to see if it could be something else, like some kind of “strain” of anxiety.   I just don't even know what to do at this point. His actions are keeping me in a cycle of crying my eyes out, trying to calm down, having him start something, and crying my eyes out again. I've tried reasoning with him, I've tried asking him to back off for a few days, I've tried to educate him, but he absolutely refuses to do anything differently and continues to try to assert that I'm the one who's just not being open minded. Not only is he attacking the reality of a disorder I’m still coming to terms with, he’s MAKING me fail at the thing he’s trying to force me to do, and that terrifies me.  **tl;dr: with my college career on the line, my dad is trying to force me to do what I need to do, but in reality is MAKING me fail, is forcing me have to prove my ADHD to him, is trying to diagnose me instead with anything else, and absolutely won't listen to reason. What do?**

Have any of you had a bad reaction between ritalin and zyrtec or something similar? I recently started ritalin and thought things were going well until one day where I felt full of despair. So I'm trying to figure out if it was due to the already present depression getting worse, side effect of ritalin, or a bad reaction to the zyrtec I started taking that day. Anybody have similar experiences?

I am one that would start reading and my mind wanders off and 3-5 pages later, I have no idea what I just read and found myself re-reading those pages. In my college years I was diagnosed with mild ADD and mild anxiety. I was placed on Adderall XR 20 MG. The medication was amazing and I would have to say it is why I graduated college. My mind was no longer wandering off and it felt like my brain was finally working and information was being retained.  I then got off of Adderall after college due to how I was taking it. I would wake up in the morning and not eat anything, take my medication then end up not eating much throughout the day. I got to the point where I also felt I should not need a drug to be "normal".   Fast forward to present day, now at the age of 27 I have new very demanding job in corporate america and I am finding my mind wandering again and having trouble retaining all the information at the new job. It has become VERY frustrating for me and I want nothing but to succeed at my new job.   Now I have gotten to the point where I wonder if I should get back on medication. I am now living a "normal" life working an 8-4 and I eat breakfast and I feel as though before I wasn't taking the medication as directed and is why I had slight negative effects (not eating/suppressed apetite), which I know is a common side effect.  A long time friend of mine who also has ADD let me have a single 10 MG Adderall and I took it with a meal the other morning before work. I am not one to abuse drugs even though this may come off as I  might be. I was prescribed this drug before so I am familiar with it but wanted to experience it in a more "mature" state in my life and see how it affected me. This was also a step I wanted to take before actually spending the time and money to go back and seek help. Please do not judge me as I know this step may be frowned upon but I felt it was necessary in telling my story. A wrong step in testing, most would say yes, but it was a step I took.  The day went very well and I was able to stay focused and retain information. It felt like my brain was properly "working" for once and I felt good. I did experience slight loss of apetite but still ate throughout the day. I guess I am just looking for some thoughts/input to see what others may think of my situation and maybe this was a way for me to "vent" a bit.

Unfocused and unclear.  I have just started Adderal for the first time in my life, and I feel ..... clear.    Amphetamine affect aside, I can see tasks now that I was never able to before.  When I go to do a task, I don't have an 'internal argument' with myself about 'how long its going to take' or 'there is no hope of ever completing it'.  Right now, I am extremely calm.  My tone in my voice has dropped.  But yet, I _see_ everything that needs to get done.    OMG, I think I am going to cry.  Is this typical with continued use, or does this euphoria eventually fade?  What can I do to keep my energy at bay?  The last thing I want to do is get over-excited and fail at everything again...  Edit:  personal experiences would be nice, if you have time to talk.. i just want to see if I am returning to 'normal'..  Edit 2: Adderal _XR_

Can you help me? ;;;Getting an official diagnoses in a couple of weeks but both my psychologist and psychiatrist are sure I have it but are meeting together to collaborate all of the testing they have done in me  While I struggle to not believe that I am not just dumb, lazy and selfish my doctors assure me that this is all just part of ADHD   How can I explain to people when they are talking to me and I don't respond properly or don't listen that I really don't mean to be rude, or when my house is trashed but I do everything to avoid tidying it that I'm not being lazy or when I refuse to sit down and play a game or watch a movie that I'm not being selfish, or that when I'm failing drastically with paperwork that I'm not trying   How do others describe ADHD to others so they don't just think dumb, lazy and selfish are a part of your personality?

Appreciate any input.;;; Hey, I’m a 22 year old female and I have not been diagnosed with ADHD but I believe I may be the inattentive type. I’ve researched a lot but the criteria can be really vague. So I have put some traits I think may be ADHD (inattentive type) but aren’t exactly covered in the DSM and other ADHD tests and would greatly appreciate any input at all. I am going to see someone on the 8th to get a proper exam, but I also just wanna see If other people are like this.   1.	Browsing an interesting topic on the web, and as you are reading the information other interesting topics (which may or may not be related to the original topic) come up and you click on them or google them and start reading about those topics without finishing the first, and then finding more and jumping to those new interesting topics. The end result being you do not finish any topic almost before moving on to another page and having a cascade of half-read tabs (I can between 5  and 20) up at once, until you get bored or tired and stop opening new topics and scan quickly through the tabs already up. 2.	Not being able to tune out outside noise, especially when focusing on something you need to concentrate on like homework or paperwork or understanding something complicated, any noise or movement is an intense distraction and makes it impossible to keep focused on the task. (I have better luck if I have music on, but only if the music isn’t new and interesting to me, but rather music I like but have listened to many times before, so it’s predictable). 3.	If your senses are bombarded with stimulus (a lot of noise, a lot of commotion and chaos, a lot of sights), especially if action, work, or concentration  is required of you, do you zone out because it’s too hard to work with so much going on? Do you zone out or start thinking about unrelated stuff when you are overwhelmed and overloaded? 4.	When talking to someone, especially when you are trying to make a case or bring up a point, do you stop halfway through a point or thought, because another point came up in your mind that you then turn to without completing the first thought (new thought is more interesting, you don’t want to forget the new thought, etc)? Gets to the point where there a lot of half-finished points and you have to go back to a previous point to finish it, and it ends up being very disorganized, not very well planned out, and all over the place?  I’m sorry for the length, I didn’t want to leave out any important information, but thank you so much for taking the time to read :)  tl;dr:  I have these traits which aren’t specifically in the DSM but I think might indicate I have ADHD inattentive type, please let me know if you do or don’t have these traits : 1. Having many browser tabs open and ‘reading’ several tabs at once 2. Can’t tune our noises to focus 3. Zone out or get lost in thought when overwhelmed or bombarded by senses. 4. In conversation moving to a new point without finishing the current point several times, makes it hard to form a well-structured and paced argument/point  Thank you ^^

Today, that hyperactivity is mostly gone, although slight signs of hyperactivity comes around from time to time. Inattention is definitely still around, but I don't know if I should call myself -C or -PI. Can anyone tell what type I am? And if not, where can I find it out (no, I will not go to my physician at the moment, I have a lot of things to do, and ADHD is making me too lazy to do all of them, despite my "efforts")?

I'm, however, having one of those days though where I'd prefer to just be anyone but myself. I just wish I could be neurotypical and NOT have the low self esteem that has resulted from my ADHD.. The sad thing is that I still haven't been diagnosed, technically, though I'm sure I will be finally during my fall semester, hopefully.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  I'm in my graduate year of school and yet I feel incredibly behind my peers. I know some of this has to do with the dramatic socioeconomic differences between me and the other students.. But a lot of it is also because I've felt out of sync with my classmates, just as I have ever since I can remember. It also doesn't help that I'm introverted and pretty much have an avoidant personality because of the ADHD and general issues related to depression and my home life.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Sorry. Just wanted to rant in a place where others may relate.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;How do you convey to people that what you experience with ADHD is different than what the average person experiences?;;;Recently I've been explaining to friends and family that's I've started seeing doctors regarding ADHD. I often get asked what it is that I'm experiencing that makes me go to a shrink. When I try to convey what I feel I try the old TV analogy. I also say things like I have a lot of difficulty following conversations, even when I'm directly addressed, I fidget constantly, I cannot sit through many movies and TV shows without pausing it and taking a break, it greatly affects my punctuality, etc.  What's weird though is that a really common response I get is "Wow, that sounds just like me! Maybe I have it." Now maybe some of these people do in fact have undiagnosed ADHD and I don't know the actual adult prevelence rates, but I'm pretty sure it's not 8/10. How do you convey what separates ADHD from just general occasional loss of concentration? I now try and describe it as an inability to maintain focus rather than a mere loss of focus, but that doesn't seem to get through either. I want to help people in my life understand but I don't know how.
b2a8b5416fbe37d8dde01399341bf8513104864e1d17983747ed1f53bf12dd60;;;Dammit I fucked up the bills again!;;;I have two checking accounts - I opened a second one to transfer all of the money for bills to so I can just forget about it because who actually keeps track of anything but the account balance these days? And because my husband &amp; I were spending, and kept going into the bill money (sigh) by accident and when the auto-payment went through we'd be in trouble. (We'd transfer over from savings to cover it. This was bad for our savings, which now no longer exists due to previous car repairs.)  So anyway, we set that up and it's great, except for I keep forgetting to transfer the fucking funds on time. And THEN when I did... I transferred $40 short, causing me to overdraft again. So this time I'm getting hit with probably 3 overdraft charges, despite having all the money already in the primary account.  This is the second... third? time this has happened this year and it's SO frustrating. My bank's charges are only $25 (I &lt;3 my bank!) but two from them + one from my cellular provider (since it's likely to get sent back, and then I'm going to have to pay them a fee AND it's gonna be late, ugh) - at least my power bill went through successfully this time because they were really angsty about it last time.  **Edit:** Oh, I forgot to add what I was going to do about this! Durrrrr.  I'm about to set up an automatic transfer for payday to transfer the budgeted amounts over. And if for some reason payday is gonna come late then I think I can edit that transfer for that one time. I hope.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Emailed doctor about new Addarall perscription;;;Hey all, I was diagnosed with ADHD about a year ago (i'm now 20). I went through quite a few different drugs (Bupropion didn't do anything after a month, then Methylphenidate 10mg a day which was too speedy, Dexmethylphenidate 30 mg a day made me feel weird, and finally Addarall which is more calmer effect since I've only been on it for a few days now). I decided yesterday to send the following email to my psych.   This morning I had my dad read it and he told me "Oh the doctor will think you have a hidden agenda" and now I'm worried this email kind of makes me sound like a crackhead or something. I never specifically ask for more and instead talk about my symptoms, so I don't know why my dad told me that. Does the email sound okay?  --------------------------------------------------  Hi Doctor XXXXXXXX;  I started taking the 10mg Addarall Friday morning, and took another this morning (along with the Bupropion as prescribed).   Is it really supposed to be more "potent" as you put it than the Focalin? I ask because the effect seems really barely noticeable compared to the 15mg Focalin, where there was a much more observable increase in focus that lasted several hours, where I could work and stay on task. With this Addarall I felt a bit more alert, close to the feelings of drinking coffee or something throughout the day.  Does it need a longer period of time to take effect like the Bupropion or is it supposed to have a more immediate, day to day effect like the past medications?  I'll continue taking it and tell you if my symptoms change in the coming days at all.  Thanks and have a nice day!

You will be held gently accountable (which is a good thing!) and we can check in with you...helping YOU get things done.  *I suggest you read the whole post to be MORE successful, so put in the little extra initial effort and continue reading....*  *** ## Choose the participation method that works for you: * **Most important task** - Share one (or a couple) **HIGH-PRIORITY** tasks that you really would like to finally finish.  *(Ex. Set a doctors appointment, finish assignment, clean the kitchen...whatever YOU think is most important.)* * **Make a list** - Post a list of all the things you want to accomplish this week.  *(I highly recommend identifying the top 3 priorities.)* * **Feed your soul** - Sometimes by relaxing and having fun we have more energy to get more done. **List a couple FUN items to make your list more exciting.**  **Need/Want to copy last week's list *verbatim*?  Absolutely DO SO!**  *Those might be your keystone habits. Once you start doing those regularly you are able to do more. soon they will be automatic and you can put your focus elsewhere.*  *** By sharing our goal(s) with this understanding community, we can keep each other **accountable**...and **celebrate our successes**, large or small!  **Don’t forget to return for [Win Wedenesday] to flaunt your successes!**  ;-)  By getting one small task done it creates **momentum**, **trust** in yourself, **confidence**, and you will feel like doing more.  *** ## Suggested Guidelines * **Prioritize your list.** One thing you want to get done (or start). What is the most important thing for you? (If making a list works best for you feel free to do that too!) * **Add a finish OR start deadline.** By committing to a date/time, we can check on your progress. * **Edit your comment when done.** - Come back and edit your comment when you have finished your goal. We can celebrate that (and then people won't check on you). * **Small start.** - Share what SMALL (under 10 minutes) commitment you can make towards your goal.  *I found when my clients didn’t reach their goals 90% of the time they never started...this will help you break through the initial barrier.*  *** ## Tips * Your tasks/goals should ideally be S.M.A.R.T goals: **Specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound** * **Measurable** - Make sure you can be able to say YES I DID THIS. **Study enough** is not measurable.  Study 2 hours is. * **Break it down** - Instead of saying clean my room...it might help to say, “Clean room for 10 minutes or pick up trash in room.” * **Write it down elsewhere** - Sticky note by computer.  Google calendar.  Agenda.  Write it down so you don't forget.  Our working memories are flaky.... * **Start small...build up slowly** - We want to build on small successes so committing to cleaning your entire house might be a bit too much to handle.  Pick a room (or a task like ‘pick up dirty laundry’)  instead. * **Want to study for 2 hours a day?** *Commit to studying 30 minutes to make it easier on you.*  *** ## Examples from previous weeks: * Wash clothes. * Finish my math class early.  **Done!** * Eat! * Run 2k. * Apply for ONE job. * Send rent. * Remember passport, ticket, etc. for trip. * **Start** *[something]*. “Spend 5 minutes on writing my paper.” * List unneeded items for sale on eBay, CL, etc. * Floss * Clean my room to see the floor.  *** ## *It’s now easier to respond!  Just copy/paste the below into your comment.*      ## Daily Habit / Procrastinated Project / Soul-Feeding     * **What?** -     * **How much time?** -     * **When?** -     * **Potential Obstacles?** -     * **Check in on me? When?** -     * **Small Start** -     * **Reward** -     * **Something fun you want to do this week** -     * **Daily Habit** -  *** Daily list template, if that suits you better.      ## Monday --       * Item     ## Tuesday --     ## Wednesday --     ## Thursday --     ## Friday --     ## Saturday --       ## Sunday --  *** Don’t forget to **brag about your accomplishments in Win Wednesday** on Wednesday.  **Celebrating/acknowledging your wins is just as important as actually getting stuff done.**  *** **TL,DR: Share what you want to accomplish this week and how you will do it.

I'm not diagnosed, but I'm quite suspicious that, at 30 years old, this condition seems to have been a part of my life for as long as I can remember.   If I'm cleaning the kitchen, or writing, I find that it's much easier to concentrate with music going in my ears, blocking out other sounds. The band The Offspring is an ideal choice because their songs are very loud and constant. The rule for the children is to not talk to me when I have my headphones in. Can anyone else relate to this?
b2a8b5416fbe37d8dde01399341bf8513104864e1d17983747ed1f53bf12dd60;;;Workplace awkwardness;;;So, yesterday at work I met another new cashier. She got hired at around the same time I did. She's pregnant &amp; seemed really cool. We chatted while doing some of the online training courses. Today we were trying to do more training courses and needed to watch a video, but the speaker within the CPU was too low.  So I tried to find a setting that might help by directing her to the advanced menu. I thought there might have been a master volume limit - there wasn't. In hindsight, she was probably annoyed with that. I should have just let her do it since it was her terminal we were going to watch it at, but I didn't. Anyway, after that, I saw some computer speakers and I said, "Oh, pause it!" and she said, "Please." That took me by surprise. I apologized a couple of times and said that I wasn't intending to be rude... I felt so awful.  Anyway, so I had handed her one end of the speaker cord because I thought it was long enough to reach, but it was twisted up so we had to untwist it. So, naturally, I started to try to untwist it - she seemed to be helping by pulling the end through the loops as I was opening them. Apparently I misread that situation as well because she laughed and said, "You're funny." I had no idea what the hell she was talking about - what'd I do? So I just said, "Huh?" and continued trying to untwist the cable. She said that she was "fully capable of handling it - I'm making a whole *person*." I think I apologized again, saying I was just trying to help, but at that point I'm not even sure if I made words.  I felt so dejected. I suddenly realized that, despite my best intentions, I had come across as bossy, rude, and possibly controlling. Maybe I am all of those sometimes, but I try not to be most of the time. So I spent most of my shift reminding myself that I shouldn't be too friendly, or too helpful, or too comfortable at work. I also noted that I should be glad she spoke up, because I had no idea at all what her perspective was, and if I don't get feedback on the negatives, I can't fix them and turn them into positives.  So while I am in a way glad, I'm also frustrated that I made her uncomfortable, and I don't want to make my coworkers uncomfortable. Therefore, the rest of the shift, I made a conscious effort to focus solely on my job and my customers. Aside from asking questions, I refrained from conversation with coworkers. I mean, being a cashier doesn't really require teamwork or camaraderie. We're there to make money, not friends, &amp; hopefully by backing off a bit on the type A personality stuff, I'll be able to move around &amp; upward within the company more easily.  All of this doesn't mean that my feelings aren't still hurt, though. I feel like a puppy who's just been bopped on the nose for jumping one too many times, I guess.

It was a good relationship and we were very much in love. At some point during our relationship, I noticed things about him that could be the symptoms of ADHD, so I suggested to him that he bring it up with his therapist. He did, and was referred to a psychiatrist, who officially daignosed him and prescribed Vyvanse and the generic form of Lexapro. Within weeks of him starting these medications, his feelings toward me changed. He went from loving me to deciding we needed to go on a break. We did, but a month after that, he decided it wasn't working, and we broke things off, but remained friends. I'm still trying to wrap my head around it, because it was so drastic. He even admitted that he felt his meds had changed something. There was nothing wrong in our relationship that would have otherwise changed things so drastically. It's been almost 2 months since we broke up, and while it may be too late to try to fix it, I was wondering, could his meds have affected his feelings that much, and if he stopped taking them, would his feelings return? Would it be worth it for him to talk to his psychiatrist about it if it might affect future relationships?
392cdbf7b75cbcfdc8576be5e8ec8112f50c37bdb83c0de7fb3b5f9180e78c3c;;;My story - looking for opinions on Strattera.;;;Background:  40 years old, diagnosed 4-5 years ago and put on Adderall and an anti-depressant (I forget which one).  Seemed to be working fairly well.  Went through a divorce, business problems and some other things and tossed my meds because I didn't want to "be on drugs to be normal".  Fast forward, lots of issues in the past 4 years.  Finally went to counseling again.  Doctor didn't want to give me Adderall due tot weight gain, no stimulants.  Put me on Prozac and Wellbutrin, after 2 months mood was great but motivation and focus were not improved.  Took me off Prozac and put me on Strattera with the Wellbutrin, that was 3 weeks ago.  After about a week I thought the Strattera was working well, I had a few excellent days - high motivation, excellent focus, really got a lot accomplished.  However it was affecting my sleep every night.  Took me an hour to fall asleep then woke up several times, getting maybe 4 hours sleep a night.  Now that I'm starting my 4th week of Strattera I don't feel the improved focus any longer, but I'm very tired from my sleep being messed up.  Not sure if the meds aren't working for me or I'm too fatigued or a bit of both.  Other things I've noticed.  I have a weird tingly scalp feeling sometimes, only lasts a second, not painful.  I'm irritable as all get out, not sure if from meds or lack of decent sleep.  I get cold / hot really easily and for no reason.  I'll turn my thermostat up to 80 and I'm cold.  However I'll have it down on 74 and I'm burning up.  I have a follow-up with my psychiatrist and my therapist next week but just wanted to see if anyone else had this experience and if they stuck with it and saw improvement or not.  Ideally I am trying to lose weight (succeeding so far, down 60 lbs) to get back on Adderall but I'd like to at least get some temporary relief until then.  **TL;DR** - Strattera doesn't seem to be working, wondering about the side effects and others experience with it.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;What did your doctor give you for treatment?;;;I'm 21 and got diagnosed half a year ago by a neurologist. She prescribed me 20mg Vyvanse and thats about it. Told me I still have to work on being focused and organized. I have not been making a lot of progress since. I don't really know how to be organized or focused, and what people have suggested so far (making a schedule for yourself, etc.) have not worked. I wish there was a class that would teach you how to be organized when you have ADHD because it doesn't seem that things that work for regular people work for me. In addition, I just don't feel like I have a good rapport with my doctor, she didn't really try to seem to get to the bottom of my problems.  I read a person's comment somewhere online that she got diagnosed by a psychologist and got bi-weekly coaching sessions in addition to vyvanse. This seems like a great idea to me.   What have you experienced with your doctor after you got diagnosed? Did he/she just give you pills, assign coaching sessions, give you tips, or something else entirely? Should I switch from a neurologist to a psychologist?
0de563c1e00c23a04b2846acb415254f9df0b4c54e5e3bbc7da8c8eb2660adbb;;;Unable to get a diagnosis but having huge problems with focus and procrastination. What to do?;;;Just saw a psych today for the second time where he asked my mum and me questions about my childhood symptoms. When it was over he deemed that there wasn't enough evidence of childhood hyperactivity to warrant a diagnosis. Evidence of some childhood hyperactivity is needed for an ADHD diagnosis and based on my mum's testimony there apparently isn't enough evidence of distractibility or hyperactivity being present during my childhood. I still maintain that when it comes to attention problems, these things are not obvious to other people who are looking from the outside in, but anyway.   On the other hand, I'm still having huge problems with focus and motivation - two years ago I lost a job for making too many careless errors and right now, at age 21, I'm on the verge on failing out of university. I feel like my ability to function and complete relatively demanding tasks (work, homework, exams) is without exaggeration ruining my life. I have had problems not being able to study for exams all throughout high school, besides general attention deficit problems. The psych seemed fairly receptive and I think he knows something must be bothering me as I'm scheduled to go back to see him in a month's time. But it still looks highly unlikely that I'll ever receive treatment. If a diagnosis doesn't materialize, what on earth should I do with myself? I prospect of continuing on with my life as I have done for the last 5 or so years fills me with an ominous dread.

This was my first hangout so I definitely learned some things!   ***  * [/r/ADHD Google+ Page](https://plus.google.com/b/109882427902210563726/109882427902210563726/posts) * [The actual hangout event on Google+](https://plus.google.com/b/109882427902210563726/events/c3f70rhm4uh8an1lhk4kpoval1o/109882427902210563726) * [My personal Google+ page](https://plus.google.com/113650690829717847863/posts) - I plan to be posting a lot more on ADHD in the near future here.  I have been floating this idea around for MONTHS now. When I try to plan it...**the week flies by** (you all know exactly how that goes) and I don't want to do it Friday/Sat/Sun. So, after 3 hours of sleep and a full day of volunteering....why not! (I really love to volunteer for the ADD non-profit and it gives me energy just like posting in /r/ADHD)  ***  ######This will last from 4-5 PDT. If you miss out (but still circle /r/ADHD) then I will notify you of the next one. Would like to have these weekly/monthly depending on how things go. *** #####Steps  0. Join Google+ if you haven't (I think everyone with ADHD should use Google mail/calendar...you all do...right?) 1. Put /r/ADHD in your circles (link at top) 2. Sign up for event (might give you a handy reminder) 3. Plug in webcam. Test microphone. 4. Get presentable and clean up the area which will be shown in the webcam (if you want) 5. **Make a name tag** - Recommended. Write your reddit name on a piece of paper or not if you don't want the accounts linked. 6. Set a reminder alarm (I would imagine google will send an email too...this is why I am testing this) 7. Come say hi!  ***  Possible things we could do:  * Say hi and share our **wins ** in person-ish * Each commit to cleaning a small area (in the meantime you can clean your desk/background) * Show our ADHD systems we have around the house (or half-systems if you all are like me) * Watch amazing Russell Barkley videos and discuss. Share other cool ADHD-related Youtube videos (no cats please) * AMA about myself or ADHD (I am an ADHD coach, support group leader, and I do daily meditation/yoga) * Share different websites/apps/timers/techniques that help us focus * I could lead a group meditation... * Go off on a **completely different tangent** and leave the hangout an hour later wondering WTF happened to the last hour of our life...  ***  So hookup your webcam. Test your microphone...and let's do this!  ***You could join just using a microphone I believe*  ***  I am heading back to volunteer (need to mail off a bunch of books for people), then I will rest/meditate, and be back to give you all my complete focus (which might be not after the 3 hours of sleep I got).

Not really sure if I'm at the right dosage.;;;So yeah, I was diagnosed with ADHD-C a few days ago and I'm only on my second day of Adderall 10mg (3 times a day every 4 hours).  I'm not really interested in getting my dose up to the point that I have some sort of academic advantage over other students. I'd also prefer to not underdose and stay distracted. I'd really just like to get to the closest point of normality as possible.  In terms of distractions, I've found that I don't really feel the distractions I used to feel anymore. I am now able to work at home in silence, neither of which was possible beforehand. I still check Facebook or my email or even just read an article or two online every now and then, but I feel a compelling need to return to my work after about 5 minutes. And while I can now work in silence, I don't prefer it.  When I watch TV on meds I actually WATCH the TV, which is crazy, because I never realized before that my eyes were constantly darting around the room when I watched TV off meds. I can also watch TV without multitasking (on the internet, on my phone, playing games, listening to music).  My procrastination seems to have dialed itself down; I actually completed two college apps today in full, one of them a full month before its due date. A bit of it's still there, but it's easy to control.  My main question is, is this how I'm supposed to feel? Part of me says that because there are still distractions and procrastination I should try a higher dose, but another part of me says that I'm a little bit TOO focused compared to the rest of the population, almost like I'm cheating. Any advice?

What can I do?;;;My brother Michael is 5 years old and really struggling with paying attention/being disruptive. He's in danger of being kicked out of the Boys &amp; Girls Club for not wanting to stay with his group, and continuously wandering off. My mother, who is already fed up with his inability to listen, started yelling at him mercilessly.   I tried to interject because I didn't think the shouting was warranted, and I was immediately shut down because I'm only his sister. Not his mother. I later tried to talk to her when she was calm about him possibly having ADHD/ADD, but she wouldn't have it. She knew when I was young that I had it and took me to see doctors straight away and she said she doesn't see it with Michael. She's convinced he doesn't it have it because he's not the same way I was when I was young.  Honestly, he doesn't really have the hyperactivity like I did, he just CANNOT focus unless it's on something he WANTS to do.  I feel like she should at least get him tested, but she won't listen to me. What bothers me the most is that my dad would treat me the same way my mom treats Michael. He would yell at me for getting in trouble at school, and I would feel so helpless. No matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't change. My mom was the one who took me to get tested and would always stand up to my dad, and my life has been so much easier because of it. I don't want Michael to have to go through this alone. What can I do to convince her to take him to see a doctor about it?  EDIT: I feel like I should also state that my mom IS a good mother. She has always given us the love and support we need, but sometimes she thinks she knows more about her children than the doctors do. She strongly believes in trusting her maternal instinct simply because it's been right before.  tl;dr My mom won't get my little brother tested for ADHD/ADD because he doesn't have the exact same symptoms I had when I was young. What do I do?

I was diagnosed a while ago at around 12, now I'm 18 and just now starting medication just to see if it helps. So far I have been very disappointing, I have been taking Vyvanse for a little more than a week working from 30-40. The 1st day I tried 50 I sweat profusely, the second was better yet still unpleasant. Furthermore, I can't say that I feel anything significant. About 2-3 hours after the Vyvanse I feel a little more alert, maybe a little jittery but It fades quickly. Maybe I don't know what I should be feeling? Just now I took 20mg of Adderall IR and don't feel much more than an increased heart rate. Very disappointed any help or insight would be greatly appreciated.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;FIRST SEMESTER ON MEDS: Just a couple questions and maybe a few comments. Bipolar II on 200mg Lamictal, recently added 20mg Adderall. ;;;Back up to 2009 when I was 18 and first started developing my bipolar disorder. I was doing above average in school, passing AP tests with flying colors and even graduating early. As time progressed, friendships and relationships collapsed. I fell completely apart. I saw a psychiatrist and was put on Prozac. Came back to say that it really messed with my mood and he just continued to increase the dosage.   Found a new doctor and she finally got it right. I've been on 200 mg of Lamictal for almost a year and I feel like my old self again, with one, horrible exception.   Ever since I started dealing with my disorder, I have found it to be extremely difficult to concentrate. Before and after Lamictal, I used to be great with math and science but everything has started to fall apart. I have failed one too many classes so I must redeem myself! I'm working on macro, managerial accounting, and stat this semester. I was prescribed adderall to help with concentration and it's worked well to keep me on task.   What I want to know is... Is it even possible for me to have ADD? I understand that occasionally ADD symptoms tag along with other disorders. So I'm curious.   My parents don't believe that I need Meds to do my homework or anything else for that matter but it's amazing because I actually finish my work. It keeps me motivated and is helping with my hermit issue. I can do and finish my homework AND go to class.  Edit::  I feel it's possible that I do struggle from ADD and it just kind of developed more and more recently and reared its ugly head when I was officially diagnosed as bipolar II.  Anyone know anything about this? A normal childhood but then developing ADD with age. I never had the symptoms as a kid but now I have them to a T. All of them.
b2a8b5416fbe37d8dde01399341bf8513104864e1d17983747ed1f53bf12dd60;;;Letter from my Psychologist to my Primary Doctor recommending re-evaluation of meds. Is it even worth bringing up his misconceptions at our next appointment?;;;My commentary will be &gt;quoted. CAPITALIZED STUFF changed for identification reasons. I'm sharing because I'm a little frustrated - he's inferred a lot from our whopping two sessions together and I already had to correct him on which branch of service my husband is in and my handedness. Overall I really like my psychologist, I know that he wants to help me, but is it at all worth bringing any of his misconceptions up? Most especially about my "average" school performance. I worked hard and had fun in school, I'm proud of my academic achievements and I've never been called average when it came to my performance in school before. It was the only thing I excelled at and I guess it hurts my feelings that he inferred I performed at an "average" capacity instead of asking if I did well. I thought I had said that I never had trouble in school, but I talked a whole hell of a lot, so maybe it got lost in translation.  **Background Information**  I initially saw Codi Pax on DATE in order to provide diagnostic formulation and treatment recommendations. Codi current resides with her husband. They have been married for the past 4 years. She has no children. She is employed as a HAPPY TREE IN A BOB ROSS PAINTING. Her husband serves in the MILITARY.  As a child, Codi stated she was fidgety, restless and she rocked back and forth and she got picked on at school because she did not wear the right clothes.  &gt;I did not exactly say this - I got picked on for my clothes one day out of one semester in high school, because I made my own wacky-tacky day, not really understand what spirit week was the previous semester. While I did wear hand-me-downs, I never really got picked on for my clothes except for that one time. Also, I still rock back and forth in the car, but he was not interested in hearing about my hyperactive tics as an adult, just as a child.  During her elementary school years, she was distractible [sic] and inattentive and she had difficulty in math. She was homeschooled from grade 6-8.  &gt;Not true - I did not have difficulty in math until High School. There's also no mention of me skipping 7th grade &amp; thus being the youngest in my entire high school when I went back. It probably wasn't really that important.  Thereafter, entered high school where she doodled in class, did not take notes and she was forgetful. Codi graduated from high school while enrolled in regular class. She was never retained and her academic grades were average. Subsequently, she obtained an Associate's Degree in ASDFJKL;.  &gt;Also false - many of my primary classes were College Prep and I did take an Advanced Prep class as well - he didn't ask though, &amp; I hadn't mentioned. Additionally, I didn't realize that it was average for students to be in the National Honors Society - I really did not have trouble in school. I loved it, I just sucked at algebra and had a higher than 3.5 GPA throughout both high school &amp; college. Although, yeah, it took me 7 semesters to get a 4 semester degree.  Codi reports no history of psychiatric hospitalizations. She was a psychologist age 16 [sic] and was diagnosed with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. She is currently treated with the psychiatric medication Concerta 27 Mg, 1 daily. She was previously treated with Ritalin &amp; Straterra. Codi denies any history of alcohol or illicit drug use. She reports no history of arrests or of criminal activities. Medically, she reports no history of strokes, seizures, head injuries or motor vehicle accidents. Additionally, she reports having difficulty sleeping, a poor appetite and difficulty completing tasks.  &gt;I didn't report a poor appetite, hahaha, I just have a shitty diet. I am eating a little in the morning, usually a Slim Fast shake because it's fast and easy &amp; I haven't got enough time to cook because I sleep in as late as I can because it takes me eons to fall asleep at night, but that makes my stomach queasy when I take Concerta because it isn't good solid food. I had explained that - I thought. -shrugs-  **Mental Status &amp; Behavioral Observations:**  Codi is a 5'7", overweight, left-handed, ambulatory female who is casually dressed and appropriately groomed. She is alert and oriented x 4. Eye contact was occasionally maintained. Speech is intelligible. She is distractible [sic], excessively talkative, restless and on edge and she fidgets and interrupts/intrudes on others. Affect is constricted and mood anxious. Her thought processes are logical and coherent. There are no overt signs of delusions, hallucinations, loose associations, phobias or obsessions. Current suicidal and homicidal thoughts, actions and plans were denied. Immediate memory is 3/3; recent is 3/3; remote is 4/4. Insight and judgment is intact. Overall, she was a reliable historian.  &gt;What does the x4 &amp; 3/3, 4/4 references mean? I'm going to ask my doctor when I see her today! And I'm surprised I'm a reliable historian. I am constantly forgetting whatever it was I was just talking about. Huh? :)  **Summary:**  Codi was given the diagnoses of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Combined Type &amp; Anxiety Disorder, NOS. Given that she continues to experience considerable difficulties on her current medication, a re-evaluation of the efficacy of her current medication is recommended. Furthermore, in light of her sleep difficulties, I would also recommend that she be evaluated for a sleep aid.
928a5429abe71740b85f15e25ababace0c548aedf30307f40734261304a0c178;;;Can you guys help me understand my girlfriends ADD?;;;Well, the title basically says it all. My girlfriend was diagnosed with ADD well before I met her. Well, she is currently on Vyvanse and its almost as if she has become a different person, but I will save that more for later on. I want to get educated about this. I want to know more about the condition itself and how it effects people.  A little background, she is 16 years old and has been on her current medication for the past 3 years. She says the medicine does in fact help her concentrate, but her personality changes dramatically when shes on the drug. She goes from someone  who will talk to anyone, who is extremely affectionate towards me, and turns into almost a shut in, and barely shows any affection at all. I am wondering if this is normal for someone on ADD/ADHD medication or if this is a sign that she should try different medication.  I would also like to know more about what its like for someone with ADHD and not on medication, I know its not the same for everyone, but I just want some understanding on what its like for someone living with this condition. I want to know what its like in her head so I can better understand her.  **TL;DR: Is it normal for my girlfriends personality to change so drastically on her medication, and can you help me understand what its like for someone living with this condition.**   Update: Well I tried talking to her about her medicine last night, she says she has tried it all and she likes its one the best, of course shortly after that she says she "Wants to take a break from our relationship". We are not broken up yet, but it probably will happen, she basically went from the sweetest, most caring, girl I have even met so someone who is shut out, and barely wants to talk to me. Its sad to see and very frustrating to not be able to do anything about it. She does not take the medicine over the weekend so things might get better then, if we can last that long.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Psychiatrist screening soon, questions about testing;;;After years of being told adhd was not a real thing by my family, I went to the doctor.  He said I likely have it, but he had to refer me to a psych for a screening before medicine could be given.  I go see them soon.  My good friend gave me some adderall (30mg), and I noticed an incredible ability to focus and get things done/not feel like an idiot for the first time.  I have no problem with it, because it's like the doctor said, "looks like you have asthma, go see another doctor and then I'll give you medicine to breathe better" - so I in essence just got the "inhaler" from my friend.  Will there be blood testing when I go to the screening?  The last thing I want is to get classified as someone just seeking meds because it shows up.  I plan not to take any for at least 3 days before the screening.  I just wanted some input from those of you who have done it before.  **tl;dr- is there blood testing for the psychiatrist screening?**  EDIT: I didn't add a bunch of detail because I didn't think it was necessary, but I asked my Doctor what the next step would be for medicine if the eval went okay, he literally told me "you will come see me after 2 appointments with &lt;name of place I'm going&gt; and if they diagnose you, I will get you started taking medicine."  I asked what the medicine options were, he listed a few, then said, if the diagnosis comes back the way I think it may, we will likely try a stimulant medication like adderall or ritalin and make monthly adjustments."    In other words, you can judge me for "self-medicating," but I don't see any harm with trying something to make a condition better which the doctor told me would be the likely thing he would prescribe.  It took me years to go in and I refuse to feel bad for trying to use something to improve my life.  If you had a physical condition that gave you terrible migraines, and the doctor told you it was likely "x" and would be treated by "y," but you had to wait a month to get "y," you also might just give it a try earlier than that to ease your pain.    Rant over.  I just want some advice about the screening so I can finally live a normal life.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Benefit show for ADHD;;;Hey ADHDers!   I've become quite the socialite at my college. There are 26,000 undergraduate students at my school. I have met local rap artists, DJ's, producers, event organizers, CEO's, and even a millionaire by simply talking to and getting to know literally everyone I can.   I feel as though I've taken socializing and creating connections to a whole new level. I'm now the one with the power to connect everyone and this year is the year to do it. Our soccer team finished 2nd to the number one team in the nation and next year we will have a football team. The university also produces more start-up small businesses than any other college or university in the nation! Yet the biggest thing we ever organized was everyone doing the Cupid Shuffle. That was years ago.   I met a member of a group called "Concerts&amp;Causes". They get local bands/DJ's to perform and raise money for a cause. I've organized a meeting the president of the organization to present my ideas next Monday. They are interested in me and my "connections". I'm extremely excited about it and also very nervous...   Concerts&amp;causes usually rent out large rooms on campus and play the shows for free. Well my Rap and DJ buddies have respective fan bases in the hundreds, damn, I even have a fan base in the hundreds. (They performed on the same stages as BucketHead, Tenacious D, Flux Pavilion, Good Charlotte, to name an absolute fraction...) This show will be outdoors and Dan(DJ) has the equipment to do so. (I'd love to get support from a sound company and blow stuff out of the water)  I'm posting here to get advice and ideas!  Things that I want to happen:  • DJ's perform  • Rap artist performs  • Motivational speaker  • GoGo dancers and break-dancers  • School Mascot  • Professional photographers   • News network  • Free Redbulls  • Free Drinks   • Free Pizza  • Free apparel  • Giveaways (ADHD bracelets? Lol)  • Raffle  • Fashion show (???)   • Mud wrestling (???)  • Fireworks  • Kissing Booth  • Me on stage with a mic hosting the event  • Easy ways to donate   • Even easier ways to donate  • Maybe businesses can sell their products with the catch that 10-15 percent (more?) will be donated.   • Candy booth  • Pamphlets thanking those that helped, links to twitters, facebooks, and instagrams. Information on ADHD and where to get further info on it. How to donate. Upcoming shows and over-the-top school spirit. Because once the show starts it definitely won't feel over the top anymore.   I have multiple promotion teams ready to go once I get a green light.   ^ Every idea mentioned I have followed through to some extent already. From Red bull to the dancers to all the high end club owners and photographers. Even the Zetas (A sorority) are interested in a kissing booth.   I want this to be a regular thing. To the point where commercial products are replaced with products by students! An event by students, for students. An event to create school spirit. Remove the stigma from "commuter school". Raise money for other causes also!   Tips? Ideas?
49313f177178b9636056fd5bd9a9cefadc92961936036089819a71f187a7c14d;;;Another "Just got Diagnosed", but I have a couple questions the doctor dodged.;;;Hey Guys,   Apologies in advance if any of this is said in the past, I did search /r/ADHD beforehand. So I just got diagnosed by a psychiatrist today, I've always felt that I was being weighed down by my inability to focus, I for crying out loud could not read a book or a textbook no matter how hard I tried. So after talking to a psychiatrist today, she diagnosed me with ADHD -c (the combined type). She recommended I start out on 27mg of Concerta since I have never had any sort of medication in the past (ADHD or otherwise). After repeatedly asking her what  I should look out for, what should I expect I got your run of the mill answers. So I decided before I get my prescription filled tomorrow I'd get some more info as to what I'm getting into here.   **1. What should I expect while on concerta?**  She says its supposed to "kick in", in 30-60mins. But what exactly does that mean? Will I be able to feel the difference?   **2. What are the side-effects most common (with you redditers), that I should be concerned about**  The doctor only told me that I would experience a lack of appetite and from my searching in /r/ADHD  it seems to hold up. But as a first time drug taker, is there anything else I should worry about?  **3. If this drug does not work (a. How do I know that it does not work?, b. By extension how do I know it does work), what should I do then? Does a drug with a particular diagnosis (ADHD -C) work with everyone on there? i.e. those who have the combined type would work on the same medication?**  Thanks a lot for helping. Sorry if any of this is redundant or already said in the past.   PS: I have a follow up on the 13th of September. And I just want to nip this in bud, before I head of to college on the 20th, *Also feel free to add any advice you think I should keep in mind, as aforementioned this is the first time I've ever been on any medication*.   **Update: So today (1st september) was the first day I took Concerta and here was my day: I really don't know what to make of it. I was unusually productive today (By standards of my summer break thus far) I managed to wipe my computer clean, install Ubuntu, set it up, get all the necessary research another project I always put-off doing, finish another project I had researched a while back, but had always put off. All while watching "The Universe" on Netflix without being "Bored". I don't know if it was a fluke or not. But I guess we'll find out if I'm nearly this productive tomorrow.**

I've got severe attention problems that look more like the result of a head injury than merely ADD. I'm also diagnosed OCD. I'm 26 credit hours away from a psych degree. School has been getting more and more horrific. I'm reasonably intelligent, but my study/student skills are severely underdeveloped. My effort is extraordinary. My return is average, until this past semester when I failed 2 of my 3 classes. If I am not eating or working out, I'm studying. I just can't seem to figure out how I should be spending my time while doing so.   **Basically, I need to learn how to be a student—how to organize assignments, break down projects into smaller tasks, and how to pull the right information out of reading materials and lectures.** It's like I'm at work, but my boss isn't. So I'm ready to work, I just have no idea what I should do, and I wing it. kind of aimlessly meandering my way through assignments, taking far more time to do them than I ought to. I fucking such at being a student. I'm actually taking this semester off because I've had enough. I love to learn and I want so badly to be able to focus sufficiently. School doesn't have to be a painful, horrible experience. I am convinced that if I can learn how to learn, that I would love school. Does anyone have any suggestions or recommendations for how to achieve this end? I need to learn how to learn.  TLDR: I've gone as far in college as I can go w/o help. I need to learn how to learn. Any suggetions?
be9a84e98e7d660f405b4710421823a04bce030762950f1edb49033f427b0d71;;;Where is the line between ADHD or similar illnesses vs. lack of motivation?;;;I've been looking up ADHD for a few years now and am convinced that I have yet. I have yet to be officially diagnosed, but hopefully when I go to my appointment tuesday, they will see that I do.  However, one thing that has been bugging me and conflicted me over the past few years, enough so that I did not go get tested, is where is the line between having ADHD and just lacking the motivation or drive to do things? I believe it's fairly common for us to do our hobbies/interest and actually be able to focus well on things we like, like browse reddit, play games, etc. But when it comes to work, school, social matters, we all seem to struggle. Indeed, rather than do the reading for a class, we'd rather read reddit.  So then, how exactly can we attribute this to ADHD? I found myself easily distracted and always doing other things than my schoolwork this summer. I had only one class that I needed to do well in, and I failed it. It's had a huge impact on my possibilities on major and I just have so many regrets... but I won't go into that.  Seriously though, my only duty was to do well in this class. I ended up spending most of my summer playing Diablo 3. I tried to do work, but rarely, and I was easily distracted and easily discouraged since I failed at breaking the work down into smaller bits, so I just always put it off.  My whole college career in general though has been somewhat like this. I am easily distracted and playing games most of the time, while my roommate is the opposite, always studying. He gets dean's honor roll, all A's, while having 20+ units, while me, I struggle taking 13 (minimum units) some of which are "easy" units (berkeley DeCal classes, student run). There's always the notion that if I had spent more time working, I would have done better.  So where is that point where it's ADHD that's hindering my progress, or my motivation, or wouldn't everyone kind of have a mental excuse that they're brain doesn't function to be motivated like that? If you tell a fat person or a smoker to stop eating so much/smoking, but he says he can't, what's being weak and what's a mental problem?  I don't know if I'm being clear...

I figured out that I am allergic to Nuvigil and quit taking it immediately (per Doc's orders). I had previously started Wellbutrin and it kicked in this week! Man does it make a difference!     We have been "planning" a trip to my in-laws. I have never been good at pulling this sort of thing together in a timely manner. This week started off tough but I have really pulled it together. I accomplished tons of stuff on my to-do lists and managed to get the kids back in school with everything they needed (big win!). I got my van cleaned out and the fluids checked, got the laundry done, packed, even dealt with a lice scare and all before we needed to leave. Usually I am scrambling to pack at the last second and end up leaving hours late or not at all. This time I got everything done in time to take a minute to sit down and write this!

Im a 20-something college student who has recently began seeing a psychiatrist for focus problems. During the first visit, my psych asked me if I've ever heard of ADHD, and prescribed me with Concerta (please note that he never explicitly stated that I had ADHD). I changed to Vyvanse after 3 weeks of bad results with Concerta, and last week during a follow up appt I switched again to an IR alternative, Dexedrine.   The reason I ask this is because I am aware that schools offer a Disabled Students program, where reasonable accommodations are made for students, such as extra exam time, permission to record lectures, etc. Now, my school requires I have an official diagnosis of ADHD in order to use the benefits of the DS program, and I'm wondering since my doctor never mentioned that I have ADHD, if I still qualify for the help.   I plan on calling my doctor's office soon to see, but I wanted to see what you guys have to say about this. Thanks in advance!

Well I was diagnosed with ADHD about 6 years ago when I was 16. I was put on Adderall and it helped me so much. I could focus and actually get my schoolwork done. It helped with my personal relationships and things were going good. Now after about 6 months my Mom got the idea that it just wasnt healthy for me to be having to take medication daily. I'm still not clear on why it went that way. I had no substance abuse problems at this time. Long story short I fell in with the wrong crowd ended up getting hooked on opiates as they actually helped my concentration and just killed all the static in my head. ended up being a heroin addict by 18 and got into some legal trouble stealing to support my habit. That forced me to quit and seek help and I've been clean for almost 3 years now. I attended AA for a while and that helped with a lot of other emotional issues but the lack of focus was always there. The first year or two I figured it could be because of the fog of getting off of opiates but this past year its apparent thats not the case. I've been self medicating with caffeine and nicotine as they seem to help calm my train of thought down, but it always comes to a point where thats not effective and it just gives diminishing returns.   Fastforward to now, I'm barely able to hold down my very simple job, my personal relationships are very few because I have a lot of trouble listening to people  and I've almost crashed into several cars driving... i've hit like 6 people over the last few years. So i'm in need of some help. I'm going to be going back to my psychiatrist in 3 weeks but i'm concerned my prior history will bar me from treatment. I'm not trying to get adderall. I rly dont care what gets perscribed as long as it helps. so is it possible, any personal experience with this?  sorry for the wall of text :/

Let me start first I cleaned my room which until today looked like a middle  class crack den, then I went running, which I have been meaning to do for ages, next I finished a book that I have to read for school and finally i got started on a CAD design for an emblem for my car. All in all it was a good day.

I can become very passionate about something and want to become an expert on it, and then become obsessed with it for a few hours to a month. This happens with a few things. Programming, Piano/guitar/singing, Running, and overcoming my social anxiety. Those are the things that come back at various times for the last few years. The longest I've stuck with something is piano, a few years of frequent on again off again practice. But with these things I will being really into them and then one day realize I haven't practiced for them in a while and stop caring about them for a few months. Is there anyway around losing focus, because I have these few very strong interests that I could become fairly competent at if only I stuck with them. I just heard someone playing piano beautifully through my dorm window which made me regret leaving my keyboard at home because now I can't practice it. But I had lost interest in practicing for the last 10 months or so.

dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Remember: Our brains are different and so are others. Being open about your ADHD may make you more vulnerable as prey ;;;First my background: diagnosed with Adult ADHD about 6 months ago. Therapy and Ritalin have gone VERY far in helping me realize things about myself and become more aware.  I also just ended a relationship with a Callous Unemotional person.   I'm writing this post, not to incite fear. But just as an honest reminder.   ADHD people can be forgetful, easy going, impulsive, and easy to distract. This can make you an easy target for someone who has absolutely no empathy.   Just like the ADHD person's brain is wired differently, so are the brains of sociopaths and psychopaths. Their brains are wired differently and there's so little research has been done on the topic. That means that few seek help or even realize that their actions are "wrong." They will most likely view you as an easy pawn in their game for control and power.    TL;DR: ADHD folks are easy prey for Sociopaths. Be alert to warning signs of manipulation.   TL;DR -TAKE TWO: Keep in mind that everyone is wired differently. Draw boundaries for others and stay focused when those boundaries are tested.
e18eeaf065e51918afc93b7f41ef5764e5fc3343b0dbdd8513355e3099f9dfd7;;;The Frustration of Being an Adult with ADHD (Rant, What's your opinion?);;;**WARNING: WALL OF TEXT**  Hey all. I've been lurking for several months now, and was inspired by the sub to get my own ADHD case reevaluated after not seeing a psychiatrist for several years. I've been seeing a doctor since July. I just wanted to share (read: rant) my experience.  Biography blurb (you may skip): I was diagnosed at a young age, like a lot of folks, and bounced from stimulant to stimulant until my teens when I was put on Cymbalta. It worked well for me. Relieving depression and upping motivation got me through high school. College is a new story though, so I decided to see a doctor as an adult. So far I've been on Vyvanse and Adderall. End Biography blurb.  I'm still on my parent's insurance with Aetna and Medco. I'm so freaking frustrated with how hard they make it for me to afford stimulants as an adult! I understand that they are steering people away from what is essentially Speed, but what about the people that need it? What about me? If anything, because I am an adult now, I am less likely to abuse medication. I openly admit that had I been prescribed Adderall in my teens, I would have abused it. I was just that kind of angry angsty teenage girl. Now, I know better, and I want to be the best I can be. Why is it so hard for people to understand that?  My doctor prescribed me Vyvanse at our first appointment. It worked wonders for me - I love it. I am clear headed, and am more aware of what I need to do in the present and future. BUT, Medco won't cover it. Why? Well, my mother and I first thought that it was because there is no generic available yet. Medco apparently doesn't like new drugs.   So, I ask to be switched to Adderall. Got a script for Instant Release to take twice a day. Mom and I go over the coverage again. NOT COVERED. We do more digging and discover that pretty much any stimulant I could be prescribed won't be covered, simply because I'm OVER 18. That's all it is. I'm too old. I could abuse 'speed' in 10mg form.   Luckily, my parents are wonderful wonderful people and have paid full price for both medications. However, I don't want to do this to them. In order to be covered (even in part) I'd have to ask my doctor to call Medco and get them to look at my individual case for approval. If find this ridiculous given how busy doctors are, and most doctor's policies with new patients. I'm a new patient, I really don't think she's going to take the time to phone a company that will probably say no anyway.   So, if I can't get this situation fixed, I'll just have to rely on Cymbalta. My parent's help with enough, I'm not going to make them pay $200 bucks to help me, and there's no way a part time job would even make a dent. I feel screwed. I tried looking into outside help, like Walgreens Prescription Savings, and even they won't go near stimulants.   I feel like this whole thing is another jab at ADHD'ers from people who think we should just work harder. Such is life?    **TL;DR** - I'm frustrated that my insurance won't cover my stimulant medication because I'm over 18. Just another part of adult ADHD that sucks. Thoughts, opinions, advice, rebuttals, slaps in the virtual face??

Anyone else have these side effects?;;;I've been on Strattera for about 2 weeks (10mg), after being professionally diagnosed with adult ADHD. My psychiatrist said that it would be a good place to start in medication, since I have anxiety issues, and take lexapro (15mg) . I am a 19 year old, 5'10", 215lb, male, and I really don't feel any improvement in confidence, focus, hyperactivity (jittery, and figetty and stuff), memory, and everything that gave me problems. Instead I'm extremely aggressive (i'm a very mellow guy) , my blood pressure has shot up, I'm nauseous constantly, can barely eat, having insomnia (i've been up for 3 days), and having hallucinations? (I'm seeing moving shadows, even when there is no item, or person there. Like the shadows aren't on the floor, they're in front of me and stuff).   Melatonin has not helped at all with sleep (I'm taking like 20mg, which I think is alot, and it hasn't affected me at all).    Are these normal side effects? or should I immediately quit and what would you recommend? I'm interested about asking for adderall, since I hear that it does wonders for people with focus, and memory problems. What do you guys think?  TLDR: Side effects are pretty bad, with no improvement. Thinking about switching to adderall. Opinions?  Thanks everyone.

I need some advice. I don't have ADD, but my husband was recently diagnosed with it. We are both 22 and have been together for about 5 years, married for about 2 months. He was only officially diagnosed with ADD a few months before the wedding, and started taking prescriptions. We had always suspected he might have ADD or something related, but he has a somewhat overly-developed suspicion of over-drugging and refused to do anything about it for a very long time.  This took some tolls on our relationship, and on his personal happiness as well. He is an extremely cynical person to begin with, which the ADD seems to really heighten, and that combined with the sort of paralyzing apathy (I don't know the medical terms? Sorry for that) made us both sometimes extremely miserable. Luckily, he knows a psychiatrist who is very educated in ADD and recommended some practical literature that made sense to him.  The meds, once he got on them, helped a LOT, and were affordable through his parents' insurance. Unfortunately, we are now on his job's insurance, with a $1000 deductible, and ADD meds are a fucking racket. It will be tough for us to afford them, but we are hopefully moving towards wrangling our finances to pay for them (he believes they aren't necessary enough to pay for them).  Until then--hopefully soon, because they are pretty darned important around here. He is temporarily in a job he hates, in a middle-of-nowhere small town we are both tired of, for the year while I finish school. It's 12-hour night shifts, 4 days a week, which would be draining for anyone--it's pretty much work-and-sleep till the weekend, which he hates. I know the ADD exacerbates an already shitty situation, and it's taking its toll on us both.  So I'm just wondering, until we can start paying for meds, and even after, what are some tips for the care and maintenance of someone with ADD? We have talked before about how ADD affects him and his behavior, so I understand some basics. When he gets home I am going to ask him about the literature that he first read, because I should read it myself. I admit I get very easily frustrated by the apathy and (I think resulting) pessimism that seem to be the defining characteristics of his ADD.  Do redditors with ADD or their SO's have any basic advice for living with someone with ADD and making life more enjoyable for everybody? Thanks in advance.  EDIT: Oh my gosh, thank you everyone SO SO much for your input! This is all great advice. I am so glad I found this community...when I get home I'm going to subscribe my husband too, haha.
5ebeac509dae3b1fb542b57780edef38585995e7430f7da012aec2e85c744e0f;;;I just turned 28 and I'm finally coming to terms with the fact that I may have ADHD after years of thinking it was "total bullshit". ;;;When I was about 14 my cousin, who was exactly two months older than myself), was diagnosed with ADHD. He'd always been a bit disruptive and had a reputation for getting in trouble at family events. I have memories of him taking a variety of different medications that he didn't really like taking to try and get a handle on things.   I'd always convinced myself, after hearing my parents and other adults say it, that his problem wasn't this "make believe" affliction but a general childlike desire to be rowdy mixed with parents who didn't do much to control his behavior and his environment (We lived in the same city but I grew up in a decent neighborhood on the other side of town and he grew up in the "ghetto" and went to schools known for being less than ideal).  I'd never even considered that fact that I might have ADHD because I honestly thought it was a load of crap.   In school I had a reputation for being a little weird and despite doing well on test my grades were pretty terrible because I never turned in completed homework. I actually remember getting yelled at a few different times for handing in worksheets incomplete but with the margins filled with little doodles and such.   I managed to squeak by high school just barely and after a few different attempts at community college with mixed results I decided I'd just take a break and work for awhile.   Over the years I bounced around from job to job. The only job I kept for an extended period of time was one that allowed me to work short shifts, paid decent, and allowed me plenty of downtime to read while getting paid.   I'd always felt like I had the potential to do better but had just failed to get excited about anything so at age 22 I decided to do something I'd considered for a few years and went to film school (ok... not "real" filmschool but a one year filmmaking program). After graduation I moved back to my hometown with big dreams of making my own films but found myself instead washing cars at a local Toyota dealer before moving up to an entry level tech (I've always been into cars) and keeping that job for awhile.   It was at this point I met the woman who is now my wife and she convinced me that I should be doing something with my interest/talent in photography/film and so she helped me start my own business.   I've ran that business ever since (it's my full time gig currently). At first I kept my Toyota job before quitting to run the business full time and then starting another job a few months later when I needed more money.   I'd have moments where I pushed the business hard and was able to make a decent living but there were also times where I'd slack off and business would be nonexistent.   By this point in my life I'd looked back at my high school days and attributed my troubles to a general laziness and disdain for repetitive homework and had (incorrectly) assumed it was past me and I had the determination to work through my issues.   It wasn't until a few weeks ago when I saw a commercial with the guy from Maroon 5 that I seriously considered the fact I had ADHD. I'd laughed during the commercial because some of the things fit my history and when I decided to do a little google research into ADHD I was mainly doing it out of boredom and to get a laugh about all the bogus thoughts out there.   It was to my astonishment to find that things really started making sense and I had a light bulb go off telling me "You might actually have ADHD"  I feel hopeful now that I seem to have found out the root of many of my personal issues. I'd struggled time and time again with what I thought was just me being lazy but I'd always given up in the past despite having the strongest determination to succeed.   Obviously, after 28 years of dealing with the issue, I've learned little tricks to help me stay on task and I'd say my problems aren't nearly as bad as they used to be but I still have trouble finishing projects, staying on task, and other common issues with people that have ADHD and I've decided that it may be time to do something a bit more drastic.   I'm currently trying to schedule a visit with a psychiatrist to see what options are out there for me to get help. I'd always had a bit of apprehension to medication but even that is not out of the question for me at this point. I'm also very interested in the idea of a coach that can help me come up with ways to tackle my specific problems so I can get myself on track.   I'm not even sure exactly why I'm writing this... I think maybe it just feels good to get it down to others who may understand and are able to give feedback. It's very important to me to get a handle on my life as my wife and I are expecting in February and I don't want ADHD to get in the way of being the best parent I can be.   I'm so happy to have found this subreddit and I look forward to sharing my progress with you all.   TLDR: After years of living in denial of ADHD existing for anyone I've began to realize that I might be affected myself.

Even though I got by, I was always miserable and eventually went down the road of self-medication which turned out very badly.  The handful of times I took vyvanse or adderall I remembered feeling like I could finally think straight.  I want to explore this possibility, but I want to do it legitimately this time.  I just don't know who I should see to get evaluated.  I looked at a psychologist's office that does intensive testing, but it's extremely expensive and I don't know how valid the diagnosis would be when it comes to getting treated.  Should I just go straight to a psychiatrist? Or is the testing necessary to getting a valid diagnosis?

286f07d096fa1f0e05550e183cefa6b74148b3f60533ef94c8c02a61db039dcd;;;Feeling hopeless;;;I've been reading for about a week now after my GF acually got diagnosed and i noticed that 90% if not more of all symptoms for ADD coensided with me,  It's the regular story "Awesome person really smart but isn't very good at homework or getting papers in on time" forgetful of instructions always have a big "void" in my chest feeling like i forgot something a deadline or similar but no real depression.  no one ever acually caught up with it or even considered ADD and hasn't to this day, so i went and got it so that i could take a test and check if what i suspect is true, too bad for me... Wait time in sweden is around 1 year and a 2 month wait after the evaluation is done,  We only focus on young people here so if iwould have been 0-18 instead of 21 i would probably get help within a month.  I am feeling very hopeless right now i don't acually know what to do or how to feel, acually feeling really down and could use some.... acually had to stop my thought there i don't know what i could use. guess this thread is pointless, Thanks if you read it atleast  TL;DR: Too old 1 year waittime, would be nice if you read it.

It's retarded and downright dangerous.;;;This is a throwaway account because I don't want to associate this with my real account.  I think r/ADHD is awesome and has helped so many people, including myself, and I will forever be thankful for it. If it wasn't for this subreddit I probably would have gone through life without knowing what was wrong with me.  That being said, I see countless posts here that wants help with studying/focusing/working without taking medication. When asked why they're not taking medication it's always either "I'm not comfortable with it" or "I tried one medication 100 years ago and I didn't like it". Usually what follows is a lot of replies with some rather useful tips without any mention that the OP should stop being a bitch and take their medication.  I know there are people who needs additional help alongside their medication and I think it's wonderful that they're willing to put in more effort to better their lives. I also understand that if a person is happy with their lives and doesn't want to take medication, then that's cool, even if I personally think they're being stupid. But the most important thing is that they're content with their lives.  What I can't stand is people not taking their medication for a stupid reason. **ADHD is not something to be proud of.** We shouldn't embrace or glorify it. Yes, it's mostly treatable and it's an integral part of who we all are, but it's not something positive, especially not today. And that's OK, a lot of people have a negative part about themselves they don't like and they still can have meaningful lives. That doesn't mean that we should fool ourselves into thinking that the ADHD part of us is something to be proud about.  What do I want to say with this? Well for starters, please mention to people who aren't taking medication that they should consider taking medication and that there are so many benefits to be had that it's foolish not to take it.  And if someone has tried a medication but that they didn't like it? Suggest that they lower their dose or try another medication and most importantly, **to talk to their doctor.**   I hope you consider what I've said. I really mean well and I like this subreddit, I just think that it can be improved.  So the next time someone wants help without taking medication, then go ahead and post your tips and helpful guidelines but please don't forget to mention that the OP is being ignorant and that medication can have massive benefits and potentially few side effects.  Thank you for reading this and I would love your thoughts and opinions on this. If something is unclear don't hesitate to ask. Keep on ADHDn bros.  **tl;dr: make sure you let people who doesn't take medication for silly reasons know that they're being silly and inform them of the massive benefits medication can have.**

Next week I will be seeing him for the second time and I don't know if it's to early to bring up something like that.   I live in Australia and I've been told that they don't like diagnosing adhd in adults.  I'm really scared, I really just want to get this fixed it's been stopping me from really doing anything my entire life, (I'm 21) but I'm scared that he won't acknowledge it or think I'm lying.

So i went to the doc for depression, he gave me some sertraline, and we mutually agreed some kind of ADHD Med would be beneficial. So back to the original dosage of 2x 20mg SR ritalin/day.  Man I forgot how much energy they give you! I went to the gym while on them, most brutal workout I've done ever.   Sadly I forgot about the side effects, like mild headaches, stomach pains, insomnia (if taken late in the day)  These Ritz are either gonna make or break me.   &gt;is there any changes I can make to my diet to subdue the nausea? Current average days meals are:  &gt;Breakfast: 4 weetbix milk and brown sugar  &gt;Lunch: 2x mandarin, 1x banana, 1x nut bar, 1x apple 1x chicken cup-a-soup &gt;Dinner: potatoes, steak, peas, bread.

It worked for me for two years. However, since moving to Western New York (from somewhere more towards the middle of the US) I have found that NO ONE wants to prescribe things for ADHD. Period. I am very confused because it isn't as if I am asking for something I don't have a history with or a confirmed diagnosis of. People here say it's because so many people abuse drugs in the area, but I really, really don't think that's a good reason to resist medicating ADHD in someone who has it.   Does anyone else have this problem? I am curious why this is such an issue here and if it is similar elsewhere. If you have had this happen to you, how did you deal with it?
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Any success with non-medication treatment?;;;I have been recently diagnosed with ADHD-C after years of chaos in my head.  After years of underachievement and down right failure with things, I decided it was time to get help because I was struggling.  The quality of my life was just not matching up with my motivation and desire to reach certain goals.....especially completing my undergrad.  I decided to give my undergrad another try and I am 4 weeks in and doing OK but definitely struggling with lectures and homework.    I was also subsequently diagnosed with 'slow processing speed'.  Some of this is a result of my eye disorders (convergence insufficiency and focusing deficiency) but also I tested very low in other verbal areas.    After meeting with my psychologist, she gave me a few treatment recommendations inclusive of a referral to see a psychiatrist to discuss medication.  I am going to do this and Reddit, you are awesome because there is a lot of great info here for me to use if I decide to go that route.    But, what I would love to know about, is people that have had any success with non-medication treatment.  Cognitive behavioral therapy, COGMED (a newer at home software program that is supposed to help build your working memory), sessions to help with organizational skills etc..... My insurance will not cover these so it will be out of pocket and I am just not sure if there is any benefit from them.      I would love to know everyones success (or lack of success) with ANY non-medication treatment.  Thanks guys.  You are awesome and while I am mainly a lurker, I find this community really has helped me connect with my own issues and helped immensely in understanding my challenges!!

She talked to my primary doctor about starting me on meds, but he wants me to be an inpatient at the local crazy house for a few days... Is this typical? I mean my therapist is specialized in treating and working with add and adhd but yet he wants me to go to the hospital for a few nights. This won't work cuz I'm 27, broke and can't leave my job for days for that. Sorry I'm doing this with my phone. My question, who all gets inpatient treatment for their diagnosis?
541b78abc0d6f21a1abce59711fbc64a0a46c21f354cf3adb5dc2e3c88249b4b;;;Trouble with Daytrana availability;;;Hey all,  I've been on Daytrana about 4 months. It is great. I had been on regular short acting methylphenidate for years and I had no idea what I was missing out on until I switched to Daytrana. It's much smoother, I don't have to deal with peaks and valleys. Also I was always forgetting to take my 2nd does so one patch all day is great.   The problem is is it super hard to get ahold of. My first month I guess I was lucky. The pharmacy had to order it but they had it in 3 days.  But these other months have been awful. Pharmacies have been saying they ordered it and then after a week on not hearing anything i check in and they tell me there was a supply issue and to try elsewhere because they can't estimate when it will arrive. Sometimes I've gotten lucky and a pharmacist has been able to locate the one store in my area with it in stock and I've zipped over there to obtain it. But most pharmacies are telling me they cant do a lookup and even within the same store I am sometimes told they cant look it up even though It's previously been looked up there. And even if they do look it up sometimes the info is out of date.  I live in manhattan. So I'm not in the middle of no where and the amount of pharmacies within walking distance of my apartment is huge. The problem is no one carries it and finding one with it in stock is not easy.  I work a ton and really just don't have time to do this each month. I tried getting a prescription for 3 months which my psychiatrist was able to do even thought it's controlled by using a special code. But my insurance only was able to cover one month at a time so i had to fill it for only one month, because this stuff is list price about $200 a box so I can't afford to pay an extra $400 out of pocket. Also finding a pharmacy with 3 boxes is a likely as finding a unicorn.  Ive been bouncing around between pharmacies this month. Things are worse this time because I went out of town for a week on business. So now I'm remaining with 3 patches left and it's dropped off at a pharmacy who says they cant even know if they'll have it until a week from now (and chances are they won't have it in a week). I've tried calling the daytrana locator line and I've not found them to be responsive or helpful.  I'm at a loss of what to do. This is the most helpful ADHD drug I've used, but I can't go through this stress of thinking I'm going to run out each month or spending this much time on locating the drug.  I have trouble swallowing pills. I can take pills which can be put in food, but can't take any extended release type pills because those can not be crushed. Please don't lecture me about your pill taking methods because trust me I've tried everything. I'm sick of vomiting while trying (and failing) to take a pill so I just can't deal with extended release pills. So this means if I want an extended release med a patch is the way to go.   Has anyone else had this kind of trouble with daytrana? Have you figured out a solution for dealing with it? I have short acting methylphenidate so I won't be medicine less when I run out, but I've gotten so used to how much better daytrana is that the regular methylphenidate is kind of frustrating now.  As far as I can tell daytrana is my only option for patch. My pdoc is pretty flexible about things and I work in a related field so he tends to be receptive to suggestions I have about med changes. Daytrana was actually my idea, he didn't know it existed. There's no other alternative out there though that meets my need to XR and non-pill though right?
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Interpersonal issues at the workplace- feel lack of communication with supervisor;;;I'm 22 and I found out I have adhd a few months ago and I told my boss almost immediately. She was very understanding at the time and said she had never noticed any problems with my work.   I feel like there is a massive communication gap between me and her which was there even before I told her about the diagnosis. I see her talking to other people in the team way more, and when it's my turn she tries to avoid talking to me.  Our workplace has a high emphasis on socializing which is where the problem starts. I am not social. I'm just not. I cannot decode workplace politics and I definitely do not suck up to people. I have tried- it feels unnatural and I feel stupid and probably look stupid as well. I am guessing my lack of emotional intelligence comes from adhd and also inexperience.. but MAINLY adhd.  Whenever there have been issues with the projects I am working on, she seems to go off at me and blame me for things beyond my control- not to mention talk about it with other people. Then 5 minutes later, someone else will walk in and I can hear laughter. I just feel like I don't want to stay anymore but I can't break my contract.   At the same time, I can't talk to her directly because that would mean getting a bad reference in future. So I have been getting counselling and talking to friends and the general consensus is that I should look for another job and remain positive in the meantime.   The job is boring too. But I want to save as much money as possible and retrain in something completely diff (no idea what that is yet)  Basically I am putting up with this stuff because money=personal development in a way. I can distract myself from work with the money I make from working. But I have no satisfaction from work and the overly political scenario is not helping the situation.  Anyone have any advice for me?

HOWEVER, I just recently completed my BS in Computer Information System at National University (nu.edu). You take only one class at a time and it is only four weeks long. The pace is very fast and there is a ton of work to do, and I found that in most classes I didn't have time to get bored and frustrated because it was over with before I got to the point of wanting to lobotomize myself.  What was double good was the fact that I did the whole thing online, so I could do the work at 3 AM and intensely focus, or, I could read for an hour, go do something else, and then come back to reading or whatever.  Anyway, I'm sorry this is a repeat post, but if it can help someone finish their education while they're young, then, to me, it's worth it! I'm in my mid-40s and wish this college class format style was available to me earlier.

I think it may be too high;;;Hello I am a 16 year old boy and my height is 5 feet 9 inches and I weigh 225 pounds. I was just diagnosed with ADHD last week and received my prescription today. The prescription is 50mg of Vyvanse. I am wondering is this too large of a dose for someone who has never taken ADHD medication before? Also, my parents are afraid that it may be addictive because it is such a high of a dose. Thank you to anyone who replies to this.
1d98ef2a0a1ba964b57570819867a22d4334f8a405dfe96fb97bf9afec42a51c;;;Holy hell! Just spent the last 15 minutes feeling like absolute shit.;;;Went on to Reddit and started reading this thread "[Why do so many run with the assumption that increased ADHD diagnoses in children must be a bad thing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/psychology/comments/10nt4b/why_do_so_many_run_with_the_assumption_that/)," and I figured the thing has fifty something upvotes so it's doing pretty good for /ADHD, and certainly worth scanning through.  Reading the comments and I am absolutely awestruck at the amount of misinformation being spewed out.  ***Comment - My thoughts***  ADHD epidemic - According to Barkley, no evidence of such.  ADHD drugs addicting - Not when prescribed properly.  Someone said people with ADHD seek out extra drama for extra stimulation. Im a therapist and think that's absolute crap. - I don't know, but I thought this was true.  ADHD testing is bullshit.  I purposely forgot things on the test and when I was supposed to hit the spacebar when I saw an X on the screen, I just mashed the spacebar because I thought it was funny.  My results said I had severe ADHD but in reality it's only minor. - Well this form of testing is by no means the best indicator of ADHD, but no shit, any test that you purposely fuck with will give fucked results.    Basically all this random bullshit being said and I thought to myself, what the hell happened to /ADHD?  Since when have these people become so ill-informed and believe in so many myths?  I felt like the only person on earth for a minute that had seen *any* of Barkely's videos.  THEN, I realized I was in /psychology and a flood of relief came over me.  Such a relief.  //End Rant   **TLDR; Everyone in comments was a moron and knew none of the facts about ADHD.  I thought this subreddit had gone to shit.  Then I realized I was in /r/psychology and felt a ton better.**   Carry on being awesome /ADHD! Cheers!
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;I haven't been on my meds for 3 years. I feel like i've learnt to control myself more.;;;I was on strattera, i believe 100-something mg.  And it made me constantly tired, never wanting to talk. Turned me into a zombie, i wasn't myself.  And then i stopped taking it, and started doing yoga. Medidation, and read alot of self control guides.  Now i feel like i'm a completely different person, but i still have one issue.  The concentration part is hard, i'm currently studying in uni. And i have a big test coming up tomorrow. I don't use it as an excuse, and i haven't told anyone. That i have ADHD and i probably never will.   But i've come here to ask, what are your tips for studying?  When i study i usually listen to music, i feel i can't just focus on one thing. I need to focus on more than one thing at once.  Thanks for reading reddit.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;I hate my life and it's getting hard to convince myself that it's worth living. I want help but everything takes so much time that I've lost hope. Is there anything I can do?;;;This isn't going to be a happy one, just so you know.  I hate my life. It's a shithole.  I couldn't pay attention when I was little. My teachers always complained that I never did any homework and that I seemed very jumpy. Despite this they never said anything about me having ADHD, I guess they never knew anything. I never oaid any attention to my scholmates and I didn't know why they hated me.  My parents never said anything either. My dad is the "life is hard but you gotta move on and work hard" kind of guy and has probably never heard of ADHD and would probably never believe such a thing. I told my mom that I suspect that I have ADHD and she said that she suspected that there was something wrong with me. I was very angry at this, why wouldn't she say or do something? She probably also have ADHD but she's self-medicating by drinking lots of coffee and smoking.  I suck at every possible thing that I could suck at at this moment. School, friends, family etc. I've gone to a doctor for help but it's taking such a long time that I feel like I'm living in a third world country (I live in Sweden). I've written a few questionnaires in three months and the "testing" will begin in 1-2 months. I can't go to another doctor because there aren't any. I have to go to this particular doctor and I have no choice in choosing another one, wheter I like him or not. I've talked to them if we can speed up the process but they tell me that it's not possible and that two months is nothing compared to what other people are waiting. Two months maybe doesn't sound like a lot of time but I'm not sure I'll live tomorrow.  Last week I told this organisation that I was feeling very suicidal and they made a huge fuss about it and said that I needed to get help immediately (lolwat) and they urged me to go to an acute psychology ward to get immediate psychological help. I was stuck in a ward for 7 hours with nothing to do but drink coffee and eat apples except fooling around with my phone. At the end of it I would have more likely died of boringness rather then suicide. Finally, I talk to a doctor and she asked me if I wanted to be locked up in order to prevent suicide. I politely declined and asked her if I could get medication for ADHD or get some testing done. She said that she couldn't do that and that she could offer anti-depressing drugs. I asked her if it wasn't stupid to try anti-depressions meds before taking care of the ADHD. She disagreed with me and said that I should start them now. I thanked here for her help and politely declined the offer (I was feeling better after eating and drinking liters of coffee at this point). After that I just went home.  She has now contacted the organisation that I should be on anti-depressing meds immediately and they will probably contact me soon. I'm feeling very weirded out because I think I should take care my ADHD before taking care of my depression, but they absolutely refuse this. I'm guessing that Sweden's drug policy is much stricter than America's.  I hate my life and I just can't fucking wait two months before getting help. I was almost got hit by a car yesterday because I couldn't concentrate on the walking lights. I've talked to everyone I could think of and it's always the same: "just wait, it's not a long time at all, just wait, wait, WAIT". I feel they are very unsympathetic and I can't get any non-medicated help anywhere before diagnosis.  There is one toher place that does diagnosis for ADHD but they apperantly take even longer time to diagnose ADHD. There are private doctors but the cheapest I could find was one who charged 2000$ for doing a god damn diagnosis.  There is nothing I can do these two montsh except contemplating suicide. I have courses I need to finish and tasks I need to do but I just can't be bothered.  I've told everyone in my family except my dad that I probably have ADHD and everyone was like "ah, ok" and they still complain about me being lazy. They didn't even ask for what it does or any research. They just said "well, you do have little attention but can you stop being lazy for now?". I've suggested that they read "ADHD for adults" by Russell Barkley to understand what's really going on but they all say that they don't want to read it and that they don't need to.  Is there anything I can do except not kill myself and wait for the test? I've just lost hope of everything now. Can I do something?  **Tldr: Live in Sweden, diagnosis in two months, feeling suicidal, can't get a faster diagnosis date or any help for that matter, what do?**.

I want to make it clear that i am NOT trying to abuse adderall for weight loss, but I definitely won't turn my nose up at that side effect.  I'm curious, though. I hear people lose weight, but I have no idea if, on average, it's 2lbs or 20lbs. I know everyone is different, but for those of you who have taken adderall, how much weight have you lost? Were you able to maintain it?  I am a 24 yr old girl, 5'9", 165. I run almost daily - not far, but consistently. I'm on 5mg x 3 daily. I'm really curious to see what this does to my body..

As background, I was diagnosed at 13, and re-diagnosed during grad school. (Now 28.) I've been on and off meds for years (mostly off).  I'm having major issues explaining this to my non-ADD friends, but hoping other ADDers may have any insight:  Sensation Seeking and the tolerance builds up - My career has been going well, I can only thrive in a demanding and high-stress workplace. If I'm not faced with this challenge, I'm easily bored and I turn to outside stimuli. This is a mouth-full but: the demand and challenge from any job can't keep up with my demand for a challenge from that job. I climbed to the highest rank possible at my most recent company faster than anyone has ever done, but I left the company because I needed more of a challenge. The stress in the workplace translates directly to stimuli, which is positive for me. However, when there isn't enough stress, I get extremely bored, disconnected, depressed. Some people say they wish that stress didn't bother them, but I feel like I'm going out of my mind. (I don't get any of the negative aspects from stress. When dealing with a high pressure situation, people say I have ice in my veins.)  Outside of work, I'm hitting similar issues. While a lot of ADD Sensation Seekers also enter into risky behavior, I've been extremely cautious and conscious of this, as I know there is a high correlation between ADD and substance abuse. Regardless, everything I do for fun/excitement quickly becomes boring as I build up a tolerance to it. I can't hold down any kind of relationship simply because it's not stimulating enough for me. I'm translating from partying hard to partying harder, and each step the tolerance builds and I need more and more. I'm in a safe place for the moment, but the demand for stimuli keeps growing exponentially and I'm afraid of where this might be headed.  Has anyone had experience approaching/combatting this tolerance to sensation seeking?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.   tl;dr - I have classic ADD Sensation Seeking personality, but I'm building a massive tolerance to all the sensation that I receive and it's not cutting it. Need advice.

I lay out daily publications and crank out editorial designs all day. Normally the staff I work on is secluded from everyone. Sure we have to dress up for the occasion but we usually get dumped in a basement room and have zero distractions until the end of the day when the client come int to check off page. This show I am in a triple sized cube, no ceiling, hot air. I can hear everything going on around me. Phones chirping, people eating, people talking. To make it worse the client we are working for is in the room. So we are facing each other and it is awkward. When we share a room with the client, headphones are forbidden. I need to block out this noise in order to focus.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;I feel crushed.;;;Just made a big step to call up the counseling center at my school and schedule a screening. I feel like I've struggled with an inability to focus for years, and really believe I would benefit from treatment. It's a bit of a big deal for me to ask for help, because I've always been stubborn and thought I could help myself.   I'm also a private pilot. I've just started getting back into it after a few years off, and am so excited to be able to do so. However, I stumbled upon [this article](http://www.aopa.org/members/pic/medical/certification/mental/add.html)*(log-on req'd). I'm so crushed. So, I have to decide between getting the help I need, and the hobby I love. Has anyone been in a similar position?  * **Edit:** Article says pilots with a diagnosis and/or medication for ADHD are ineligible for a medical certification, therefore ineligible to fly. "For medical certification consideration, you will need to have discontinued all psychoactive medications for at least the preceding 90 days.  After being off the medications for 90 days, a neuropsychological evaluation should be conducted."

It's difficult for me to evaluate it's effects on my ability to focus. I think it works somewhat (I am considering supplementing it with IR later in the day) but I have been reading threads where people say "medication x did nothing for me, but y was like a whole new world". I'm worried that I am just feeling the positive effects of taking a stimulant and there is probably a medication out there that would be perfect for me. I would like to ask my doctor if he could prescribe me a variety of medications to evaluate over the course of a few months but I don't know if doctors dig that kind of thing.   also: I have been diagnosed with SCT and apparently medication is not as effective for treating it, but I may have comorbid ADHD that the medication may be helping.  TL;DR  I feel some improvement of my symptoms with my current medication, but I'm wondering if there are meds out there that would work better. and if so: how do I go about finding out?
7c57dd341b403b491163c9c579df3c1468f1bcceaf7aac98e24771a17ee3adf4;;;Long post but I really, desperately need help. Please read if you have the time.;;;I want to start by saying that making this post is something I've been wanting to do for a long time, and this is the result of many attempts and tries to get all this stuff down. If it's confusing in any way let me know and I'll do my best to clear it up. If anyone takes the time to read this It would make me so fucking happy. Also I'm female. Just saying it now so I won't have to correct anyone later.   I need help. Very bad. But I feel completely frozen. I come so close to making appointments with various doctors but when it comes time to hit submit or press dial, I stop what I'm doing. It's like my mind just turns off. This is what happens when I try to do anything important. The fact that I have this disorder has been lying dormant in the back of my mind for so many years. I found this subreddit by hitting the random button about a month ago and it piqued my curiosity. It got me reading and listening and before long it had become overwhelmingly clear to me that I finally need to stop denying that I have ADD.   ADD has been a huge part of my life. I was born to two parents who were already diagnosed shortly beforehand. My father, who was diagnosed into the severe category, was prescribed copious amounts of dextroamphetimene, while my mother (prescribed the same thing in a much smaller amount), stopped taking them almost right away, I assume due to my being conceived.   When I was twelve, I was beginning to show the signs. My father suspected ADD right away and I was taken to a doctor to fill out forms and answer questions. They gave surveys to all my teachers at the time. The same testing was done on my brother and he was diagnosed, which was a surprise to everyone because he has never really seemed to fit the description and still doesn't. He was prescribed Dexedrine but never took them, and doesn't seem to suffer any ADD symptoms today. It's not even a part of his world.  When my teachers' surveys came back and I was denied a diagnosis. I vaguely remember the doctor casually say to me that I probably have depression, but nobody did any further tests on me after that.  I was never hyperactive as a child. Around other children I was always very quiet and never knew how to interact with anyone else, so I kept to myself. School made me anxious, especially math, and it did not take long in a given day before my mind and emotions were overwhelmed. Most of the time I could not do anything at all. I just sat at my desk and tore my erasers into pieces, and then tore those into smaller pieces while my mind escaped to anywhere but there. My teachers ignored me just as much as the other students did. One of the same teachers who was given one of the surveys later had to be reminded who I was when my dad saw him at Parent Teacher night.   After my diagnosis was denied, it was still very clear that I needed help. My grades were a mess, I had no friends, I was constantly late for school even though I lived just blocks away, my teachers would get impatient with me for not following through with assignments and failing to accomplish simple projects, to the point of actually yelling at me a few times. It destroyed me. I never knew what to say but sorry. All I knew was that my father still thought I had ADD. But the doctors apparently didn't think so. And I was twelve years old and didn't know what any of it really meant anyway. I just wanted to feel like a normal kid, which I knew I wasn't.   When I was thirteen my dad did something that changed my life in a way that was both completely miraculous and utterly horrifying: he suggested I start taking my brother's medication, which he didn't take but still got. Thinking back on this, I really don't know what made him think that was a perfectly okay idea, or if he even thought that at all. But he really believed it would help me.   One thing led to another and it just became something I did and didn't think too much about. And it did help, immensely. For the first time in three years I began to feel like a happy, well-adjusted person. I loved being organized. I started getting As and Bs (and Cs in math which was a huge step up for me). My self esteem went from  0 to moderate. I started making friends at school. My life had gone from a drearily chaotic existence to feeling like I could finally relate to the rest of the world. All with just 10mg a day.    I continued to dose myself with the stuff for four more years, deciding my own dosages and times to take the pills. What turned into one a day eventually grew to two as I attempted to tackle Running Start college classes towards the end of high school. When I hit seventeen it all became too much. I was burnt out and feeling very uncomfortable with the eventual realization that my unregulated, very emotion-driven relationship with Dexedrine was extremely reckless possibly dangerous. I stopped taking it, stopped telling myself I had ADD (or any disorder altogether), moved away from home and went on with my life.  A few years have passed since then, and while I have a steady job and a rock-solid relationship, I have    become unable to deny that there is something huge getting in the way of living the life I want to live. My life is a jumbled mess with the two things I mentioned above have become my only source of stability. And while I try my very best to stay focused at work, by worth as an employee has been questioned several times, and my recent failures there are starting to make me very nervous, and has pretty much thrown me into gear.   I've collected phone numbers and doctor information, but I'm utterly terrified of going any further. I don't go to doctors very often and I don't know how to find someone I trust enough to tell them about my complicated history. After much soul-searching and research, I've decided that I definitely want to take medication again because I know it would help me get back on track, and use that boost in focus and energy to arrange a healthier diet and lifestyle for myself that I otherwise seem completely unable to obtain. But I'm afraid I'm going to be labeled as someone who's just trying to get my fix, and that I'll be refused medication because of it. I wonder if I should say anything at all--but it feels like such an important part of this lifelong struggle that leaving it out would be detrimental to my diagnosis. A huge chunk of my history is completely different from the rest. You can see it in my grades. Those were the four years that I ate well and exercised, when I took AP and Select classes, when I had confidence in myself and attained what I wanted. I was a different person for those four years. I was who I wanted to be. I don't want to have to lie about that. I want whoever I talk to to have a firm understanding of my particular case.  And so I'm frozen. I have numbers but I won't call. I have addresses but I won't email. Because I don't know what kind of questions they're going to ask about my childhood, and I don't want to get caught up in a lie I never even wanted to tell in the first place. I've been dealing with huge amounts of guilt over the whole experience of taking Dexedrine the way I did, and I'm only just being able to not feel dirty about it. But still I'm afraid of what the doctor will think of me. I'm afraid I won't be able to get the help I really need.  **TLDR: I need to get diagnosed and on medication, but I have a history that involved ADD meds without a prescription and worried about how I should go about this.**  I've never shared this story with anybody but my SO. I've never heard a single outside opinion on any of this, so whatever anyone may want to say is enormously appreciated. Has anyone else been in a situation like this one before? Also, I live in the Bay Area, and if anyone knows of a good doctor I can trust then you'll have basically just solved my whole problem.

So, a couple of nights ago, my fears which I shared in [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/10ovvr/ive_made_two_big_mistakes_due_to_lack_of/) really culminated - I had made two relatively big mistakes in less than 30 days, of course within my 6-month probationary period at my new job as a cashier. I LOVE my job, but as my husband put it, *"When you have a bad day at work, you have a few bad days at home."*  This really concerned me - I know I have a [tendency to think catastrophically,](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/107xkl/im_learning_to_overcome_overthinking_what_ifs_id/) so I tried to think very realistically. Well, realistically, I could have been terminated; however, at worst, I'd be written up and moved to other duties for a while before being allowed to return to the register.  Today I was written up - it was a negative counseling - but we discussed my "problem" (my supervisor refrains from calling it a disorder, attention deficit, ADHD, or anything else - she calls it "the problem that you have" or "your problem") and how I could probably move to Hard Lines or Soft Lines if working a register continued to be an issue.  I also spoke with the Learning Facilitator today who also had ADHD, and who is also one of the Equal Employment Opportunity representatives (which I had forgotten about) and she suggested that I read ["You Mean I'm Not Lazy, Stupid or Crazy?!"](http://www.amazon.com/Stupid-Self-Help-Attention-Deficit-Disorder/dp/0684815311) - she's actually going to let me borrow it.  We also discussed my medication - I told her I was only taking it on work days and she highly suggested I take it daily so that my body stays acclimated to it and so I don't feel sick when I take it after a couple of days off in a row. (It does make me queasy when I don't eat enough before I take it.)  She also informed me that as long as I'm proactive and not *actively* doing anything to harm the company, I would be protected from being fired due to my ADHD. I am not sure how I feel about this - part of me wants to say it's not fair for them to not be able to fire someone who makes a lot of mistakes, but I also feel good about it, because I am already working on improving so that I don't make this mistakes... plus, I actually want to be there. I enjoy my job, and I'm good at it (when I'm not messing it up). So there's that.  Anyway, I wanted to share that. I was so immensely nervous about the discussion I knew I would be having with my supervisor - I'm just so glad that she called me in sooner rather than later. I'm not sure I could have lasted all week without some kind of conclusion.  Thanks so much for your kind advice and encouragement, r/adhd. I've not been doing the Kick Start Sunday or Win Wednesdays lately, but I'm hoping to get back into them - they really are helpful, and if you haven't participated in them before, I highly recommend you do so!  **TL;DR - Didn't get fired after mildly freaking out about maybe getting fired a couple of days ago. Found out I can't actually get fired because of my ADHD, as long as I continue to be proactive &amp; improve. Immediate supervisors &amp; EEO are all on my side... and I'm feeling much better about the whole situation. Thanks r/ADHD!**

Also, I am one fucked up individual.;;;So after reading up on /r/SCT , I realized that this fits me almost perfectly.   * I do have selective attention. * It does feel like my mind is foggy. * I sometimes have problems finishing stu * I stare alot - Like my eyes get sort of "locked" wide open while staring at a fixed object. * I can also carry out a conversation, without being mentally present. Like, what the fuck. My subconscious registers what the other person says, but I could be in my own world, thinking about some entirely other shit. And when I "return", I go all "uhm, what did you say again?" and they just stare at me kind of dumb. * I lose shit kind of often - I forget stuff all the time (like forgetting my backpack or some stupid shit like that). * Since I was little i have always been told that I'm "in my own world". * My mind is a fuck, there's nothing I want more than to have control over my brain.   But on the other hand, I am a pretty social guy.  I go to parties, I hook up with nice looking chicks, I have a confidence way above the average - On the verge of narcissism maybe?  I have alot of friends too, the "popular" ones, and the more geeky, intellectual ones. One "kind" of friends simply dosen't sate me, I need different kinds of stimulation.  I think I have a lower amount of empathy - I couldn't care less about the feelings of people, and I see it as a victory if I manage to manipulate another human being, but I'm extremely sympathic (fuck logic). Like, if I see a fat person waiting in line at the post office, I can get so fucking depressed thinking about how hard he must have had it, dealing with shit in his life. I also find myself analyzing every bit of social interaction.  I kind of feel like the character Dexter Morgan in "Dexter", in the sense of that there is so much crazy shit going on inside of me when I'm seemingly normal. I don't engage in the killing part, lol.  Also, I'm very active when I want to. I lift weights, and I do acrobatics. When I start to train, I usually don't quit until I'm too tired to do whatever I was doing, and this might be for 3 -4 hours. I train rigoriously.  I visit a shrink, but he is kind of retarded. I mentioned "inattentive" once, and he hit me up with ritalin 20mg XR and 10mg IR. Whenever I give him feedback, and try to tell him that It helps just a tiny bit, he goes "BUT IT HELPS RIGHT?".  I just remembered I suck at structurizing shit and that I should probably reformat this whole text but my back is killing me because of this fucking office chair piece of shit so I will do it later if it looks absolutely horrendrous.  So my question is: What the fuck is going on inside my head?

dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;I love Ritalin but Concerta is worthless... why!?;;;Okay, I just switched up my meds and now I'm confused.  I had been taking 10mg of Ritalin 2x-3x a day, because it would wear off in an hour or two. My last psychiatrist had me on 20mg pills twice a day, but i lost my insurance and had to ration and i realized that cutting them in half and taking them like that worked. And when it worked, it WORKED. It was glorious. My anxiety and depression symptoms disappeared. I could clean the house, do my homework, do my work stuff, etc. I could get everything done, and i felt great. I was calm, but energized. I definitely wasn't hyped up or about to run marathons or anything. I loved the Ritalin, i just wanted something that would last the whole day, so maybe i could actually be on my meds for class and not just homework, etc.  Well i switched doctors and though this guy (psychiatrist at the outpatient wing of a mental health hospital in my university) who my psych nurse practitioner works with doesn't normally give stimulants, she convinced him that I truly do need it. So from the dose my last doctor had me on, 40mg of ritalin a day, they started me on 18mg of Concerta. Even though I'd tried Concerta before and it hadn't worked.   Sure enough....... it didn't work. I called, and she told me to double the dose. So now i'm on 36mg of Concerta. I can tell I've taken it because my heart beat is faster (not hard, my blood pressure is crazy low to start with), but I can't even tidy my desk, let alone get any homework done. I just noticed that my anxiety isn't better at all, when with Ritalin it would be GONE, totally. Ritalin gives me enough energy to get stuff done, but this concerta doesn't give me any energy at all.  I guess my question is basically, WTF?? From everything I've read concerta is just long acting Ritalin. Is it because 36mg slowly delivered throughout the day is still too little at a time? How many "doses" does XR give? With the Ritalin I would get 10mg at a time. It wouldn't last, but it worked! I'm going back to the doctor on Monday. Do you think she'll just up me to the 56mg concerta? Would even that give me enough at one time to equal ~10mg? How can 36mg spread out still be so worthless to helping my anxiety at all? I had tried a XR Adderral once and it worked pretty well. I don't know if it is a dose issue or if i should be really asking her to switch me to adderrall XR. And it's hard because doctors always think ADDers are just drug dealers wanting to make money anyway, and i never actually see this doctor, my nurse is my go between and she doesn't really know much about ADD meds because they don't usually deal with them, I'm just a particularly desperate case that they don't want to turn lose during my senior year.  **TL;DR: Ritalin is awesome, Concerta during midterms is going to destroy my life. What is up with that? Anyone else need to take high doses of Concerta to get any effects?**

However it's been rather recently (around the last two or three years), that I've found I've become rather apathetic in many things that I *am* doing, or *should* be doing.  I've simply found it difficult to motive myself to do something I love (such as reading or playing a video game), or something I dislike doing but *know* that I *need* to do (such as cleaning dishes or doing laundry).  Only in the past few months have I learned that there is a strong correlation between lack of motivation, and ADHD.   I am currently unemployed but have attempted to find a job in the past few months to no avail, mostly because I've found it difficult to motivate myself to care enough to contact enough companies, or to follow-up, and I'm reaching my breaking point.  There are other goals I had for the summer, but the lack of self-encouragement and drive constantly reared its ugly head and most of my goals were hardly even started.  Like many of you I have a lot of creative ideas floating in me that I would really like to just get started on.  Medication helps me focus, but it doesn't necessarily *motivate* me.  So my question is: to those who have found themselves in the same boat as me, how do you manage to motivate...and stay motivated...in  sticking to a project or task?  Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks.  TL:DR I have found it difficult to become and keep myself motivated.  Solutions or tips on how to do so would be greatly appreciated.

What are your reasons?;;;Hello guys, I'm diagnosed with ADD (although I learned that's called ADHD now) and have been reading the post in /adhd for a while. I've seen a lot of post about people who have or want meds.   I don't use meds at this point, and I never had before. I was diagnosed (3-4 years a go) after I had my hi school diploma and figured I would just try without meds first - but with the knowledge of add/adhd and therefore some adjustments.   Out of curiosity, are there more people here without meds? What are your reasons? Are there people who use meds occasional, for example only at school/workdays?  Is there a difference in how you act and the stuff you do with and without meds?

Getting stressed out about not being able to focus or fit in is also a killer on concentration.   Just look at yourself with compassion and relax. We all have our limitations in life. It is how we approach and deal with them that count.  Attacking yourself will only bring out the worse in you. When you feel terrible and can't focus, don't give up. Look at yourself and your troubles with kindness. Stop cluttering your mind any further and use your strengths.  Cheers,

I was diagnosed over a year ago but only recently have I found a CPAP machine and settings that work for me. So far, the results are encouraging.

I'm nervous, guys, can you help prepare me?;;;Been through some therapy, talked to counselors, had a neuropsych eval about two years ago. I've been diagnosed with moderate-severe depression. I can't hold a straight thought together, I forget where I put things, even after five minutes of setting them aside. I feel like I'm trapped in my own head 90% of the time and I'm missing most of my life - or fucking it up by being inattentive and out of it.   I'm being tested on the 17th. What can I expect? Is there anything I need to do? Anti-depressants made me incredibly violent and emotional, what can I expect from ADHD meds if I do end up on them?   I'm pretty freaked out. I guess that's stupid, but I don't know what I'm getting myself into. My brother and my mom both have ADHD, so I don't know if that's useful to know.   *tl;dr* Given run around by mental health professionals, getting tested for ADHD, not sure what to expect if I do have it. Halp.

For example, I just watched Season 1,2, and most of 3 of Breaking Bad in about 2 days. I had things to do, but it was crazy hard to stop. I've been diagnosed with ADHD-Inattention. This compulsion has happened all my life with various avenues (usually I'd stay up very late doing them, or do it all day when I'm procrastinating) and medication seems to help it (I watched Breaking Bad when my medication wore off for the day). Im wondering if this is an ADHD symptom?  Edit: Great responses. I'm actually thinking this may not be hyperfocus. Hyperfocus would be something like "flow" with intense focus and interest. The behavior I'm describing is more of a compulsion, almost addictive-like behavior. I don't want to do what I'm doing, but I can't stop it. It pulls me in with some kind of reward-esque instant gratification. It also gets worse with anxiety, like if I'm procrastinating.   Edit 2: Wow. I'm so relieved and simultaneously interested. It really seems like this is ADHD related.. My people!! Oh my god, I'm so glad to hear from you all. It's really these behaviors that cause so much anguish in my life and destroy many opportunities.   Well, now I'm curious whether medication has had an effect on this for you? Does it help? We gotta figure out a way to stop this..

I've been lurking here for sometime, and I finally decided to go ahead and get an official diagnoses after suspecting that I have ADHD for a long time (I exhibit most symptoms and have a strong hereditary history throughout my family).  I've been seeing a psychologist, before I could get referred to a psychiatrist.  I've been in for 4 sessions, 2 where we've talked about my history, one where we went over a questionnaire that my husband and I filled out, and today where I took a TOVA test.    My husband and I's questionnaire had significant difference in terms of severity of symptoms (he ranked me as not having the disorder, I think he was just being easy on me).  Today I took the TOVA test which had two portions.  The first portion I had to click a button when the box was at the top of the screen, as opposed to the bottom, which occurred ~25% of the time.  The second portion was the same, with the box at the top appearing ~75% of the time.  I did fine on the first part, and poorly on the second part.  Together, this put me at borderline ADHD along with my questionnaire.  I am now under the impression that my psychologist no longer believes I have the disorder.  I am still not convinced.  I am so frustrated right now at the thought of not being able to get the help and medication that I need.  Everything about the disorder resonates with my life and I really am still convinced that I am still affected.  I'm meeting with him again next week to go over my options but I'm starting to wonder what's the point.  Has anyone else experienced this kind of set back when trying to get a diagnosis?  How did you handle it?  TL;DR: I'm too good at clicking buttons, and now I'm probably not going to get a diagnosis.  Now what?

Because we're not all jumpy and hyperactive, I get that it's harder for us to notice changes in our own attention spans and what not, but specifically, what are some ways that you all can tell your meds are working?  I guess I'm looking for some quantitative ways of measuring, if there are any.  (I feel extremely uncomfortable asking friends blatantly if I have been acting differently lately.  I don't wanna freak them out.)  My doc has been pretty flexible and has given me the go ahead to try 10mg capsules, up to 6 in one day, but only after trying each level for around 4 days to see how I react (ie 1 capsule for a few days, 2 capsules for the next few days, 3... etc until the side effects are too much)  Also, what's the crash like?  The same as those with hyperactivity, or is it more subtle?  Here's where I'm at so far:  * 10 mg/day did nothing.  * 20 mg/day a bit more focused.  Still distractible though. (This may be the dose I end up with.)  * 30 mg/day Head feels a little heavy/thick/(but not foggy), into the afternoon a headache comes on.  Slightly tight chest.  I've been drinking a lot of water to compensate for the meds, and the headaches may just be from tapering off caffeine too quickly.  **TLDR: Basically, how did you find the right dose for you?  When was it too much, and when were your meds not working enough and how could you tell?  For innatentives in general, what medication works best?  Thanks!**  (I searched a few times but didn't quite find what I was looking for.  If anyone just wants to pass along some links, that would also be totally fine by me.)

Here are my ADHD-relevant subreddits:  * /r/productivity * /r/minimalism (less stuff, less mess!) * /r/fitness (exercise really does help!) * /r/keto (studies suggest that low carb/gluten diets may help with ADHD) * /r/GetMotivated  * /r/getdisciplined  * /r/personalfinance (for those who have difficulty managing their money)  **Yes, I do see the irony of using Reddit to help manage a disorder related to distraction and procrastination.**  I also use multiple Reddit accounts to manage my Redditing. This allows my frontpage to be less cluttered, and stops me getting *too* distracted/ overloaded when I'm on Reddit. This is all about personal preference, but I have dedicated accounts for the following, which are only subscribed to relevant subreddits:  * Weight loss/ fitness * Finance * Starcraft * Porn * Programming * Piracy * General entertainment/ posting (this one)
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;What dosing frequency has worked well for those of you with Adderall IR?  ;;;Hi everyone!  I am a 32 yo female recently diagnosed with ADHD-PI.  I am looking for help on a good dosing schedule for Adderall IR.  I see a great psychologist and have a wonderful ADHD coach that has helped me immensely.  There have been so many positive improvements over the past few weeks that I am excited about but I am still trying to perfect a good dosing schedule of my Adderall IR.  I have discussed this with both my doctors and they have offered some suggestions and said 'to play around with the dose' but I am hoping you guys through personal experience can help me!  ADHD doesn't just affect me at school and it's been my choice to take my meds most days.  My doctors have also encouraged it.  I have some very long days, especially school days and days that are heavy on homework.  The problem I am still facing is evenings and dealing with the inevitable crash.  This is an issue for a few reasons:  1) This is the time that I usually spend with my partner.  Taking another dose of IR too late in the day interferes with sleep but the crash I typically feel (antsy, accelerated heart rate, weird feeling) is just plain uncomfortable and affects my overall mood.  He is awesome and it's important to me and our relationship to not always feel yucky when I see him.    2) I have a few days a week that are pretty long because of school and homework.  I have been trying to organize my life around Adderall but there are times where this just isn't possible.  Sometimes doing homework later at night is the only option.  The crash doesn't put me in a great mind set to get things done.    So, a few questions:  1) For those of you with experience taking Adderall IR, do you feel like the crash feeling have gotten better with time?  I have tried a lot of tricks offered in this subreddit to helping with dealing with it, but none seem to be very effective.    2) They have suggested moving to an extended release dose during the day and then taking an IR dose later in the day.  Has anyone done this and if so, does this help with the evening crash?    Thanks so much!!!  **TL;DR: Trying to find a dosing schedule that works well for me in all areas of life.  While Adderall has worked awesome for morning and afternoons, I am struggling with the crash feeling in the evening. **
e1d8d2129cef42d54e1d6e97603490be3075d018abc2531e6ae9bafad3b68847;;;Just wondering if anyone else has had this issue of ambivalence towards life.;;;I'm 19, and was just diagnosed with ADHD within the last 2 months. Maybe this is wrong place to put this, but I thought I might as well see if anyone else with ADHD here shares this.  The issue in question is a general lack of ability to care about my life. If I had an off button, I would have pushed it multiple times over, not because I'm feeling sad or depressed about anything, but just because I don't really have any motivation to continue living in general. I've been raised in a great environment, my parents love me and have provided excellent parenting throughout my life for myself and my siblings, and I honestly don't feel any kind of constant negative emotion (Sure, I'll feel negative emotion towards specific unpleasant scenarios, but my point is it's not a depression.). The few goals I have have nothing to do with any sort of self sustaining lifestyle, and even those fade after a short time of separating myself from the environment that briefly stimulated them.  At this point I'm fairly certain that I wouldn't even do anything if I were forced to provide for myself. Obviously this kind of neutrality isn't normal, so I'm wondering if this has been a problem for anyone. I've been on vyvanse for two weeks now (started on 20mg, went up by 10mg every three days until I hit 50 and am staying on that for a month), but although I noticed somewhat of a boost in ability to hold onto focus, it seems to be fading already. Even when I was noticing a difference, it was only for 5 hours or so each day. Right now it just seems like a big Catch-22; I need motivation to get motivation, so the only option I really see is waiting for some combination of meds to work.  TL;DR - Can't give a fuck. Has anybody else had this issue like this/how'd you deal with it?

What questions should I ask, or any other tips would be appreciated.;;;So after 4 sessions with a psychologist, I finally got a diagnosis and he referred me to a psychiatric office to talk about medication.  I have an appointment scheduled on Wednesday and was wondering what to expect from the doctor, and if I get a Rx what to expect for the first few days.  Just some background, I was prescribed Adderall three years ago and reacted really badly to it.  I had severe headaches and vomiting three days after I started taking it.  It's a long story about why I didn't follow up with my doctor, but I just ended up throwing them out and giving up seeking treatment until now.  Will this indicate my reaction to other medications?

Breathe...and center ourselves...This week: Metta (lovingkindness) phrases;;;Namaste!  Welcome to the first ever mindful Monday. If people like this...I will continue it.  This will be a simple post each week. A thought, meditation instructions, quote. All you need to do is breathe...read...and relax....  Metta is a meditation practice where one calms their mind and radiates love towards themselves, a loved one, a neutral person, and an enemy.  I just finished sitting and practiced the following phrases towards all 7000 members of /r/ADHD:  *May you be happy.*  *May you be safe.*  *May you be healthy.*  *May your body and mind be at ease.*  *May you be focused.*  *May you love yourself completely. Without judgement.*  Repeat x5  ***   &gt;By practicing Metta meditation, we are creating a skillful habit of mind, one which allows us to soften into the deeper experiences of our lives, the chances to connect with all that is around and within us.... to live more fully. It allows a spaciousness to develop in the mind allowing us to be less reactive, less stressed out, more calm in the face of challenges, losses, injustices.  &gt;At the same time, we are breaking the unskillful habit of mind associated with greed: possessiveness, fear, separateness, hatred. We are moving away from the habits of anger and aversion, rage, despair, disappointment.  Source: http://www.bemindful.org/metta.htm  ***  When I started **I was surprised to discover how hard it was to feel this love towards myself** (this is often the case). By practicing again and again, I finally started to break the barriers. Took months. But I finally broke through. You can too.  I suggest doing this via a guided meditation to help you remember the phrases (initially I forgot them often) and keep your mind on track.  * Learn more about metta meditation (audio + pdf) http://audiodharma.org/series/1/talk/1728/  * Guided metta meditation (27 minutes) [http://media.audiodharma.org/mp3files/2001-09-06_GilFronsdal_GuidedMetta.mp3](http://media.audiodharma.org/mp3files/2001-09-06_GilFronsdal_GuidedMetta.mp3)  ***  Let me know how it went.

I was diagnosed around 7, stopped taking meds at 10/11, and started again around 21 in my 3rd year of university.   My issue is that the doctor i saw has been on sick leave for a very long time and never really advised the dosage for whichever med i chose to use, only that ritalin lasts 4hrs and concerta 12. I have no fucking clue how do schedule this shit!  Additionally, both of these meds suppress my appetite and even though i feel so incredibly productive and engaged (which i fucking love), i just cannot sacrifice eating. I am too skinny as it is and i can literally go all day eating little to nothing from one ritalin.   Can anyone help me out with advice from their own experience with these two? I really want to kick ass every day.  Also, i can sometimes feel really emotionless while on my meds, i'm happy yet i just cannot communicate with those around me.   ....Again, i saw a lot of words underlined with red up there but i just cannot be bothered to re-read. Sorry!

THANK YOU in Advance!;;;Some background:  * I am a 41 y/o woman with documented ADHD symptoms as far back as when I was 7 via a WISC test to determine psychological impairment. * I visited psychiatrists and neurologists in my 30's. Started on Wellbutrin, to no effect, even at 450mg of Wellbutrin XR. * Later, was diagnosed with ADHD and Depression. Prescribed Prozac and Concerta which seemed to work awesome, until weirdly, about 4 months later, it all fell to shit. * Tried Adderall - gave me such pain in my mouth (neuralgia, paraesthesia) I had to stop amphetamine-based stimulants altogether * Gained tons of weight on various anti-depressants. Gave up and tried to go off all psych meds altogether, both ADHD and Depression meds. * After 12 months, I am a mess. Can't do anything, it seems. Contacted new Psychiatrist who evaluated my school records, even though I asked her for anti-depressant meds. Based on my records, at 41, she says she must first treat me for ADHD, and will only later if it does not work treat me for depression. * 36mg of Concerta - her first choice for meds - isn't doing diddly for me. I take it a 7AM and am ready for a nap at 2PM. Isn't this supposed to be a **stimulant**? How does it make me want to sleep? Tried 54mg (which I tried before with another doc) by adding the original 18mg she prescribed for me, and it doesn't help.  Any suggestions for next steps? I go to see her in a week, and I don't know what to tell her. I still feel depressed and unmotivated. When I **first** started on Concerta at 18mg I felt like I could do something, and I did, for about 36 hours. Then it's been a waste. Can you start on a med, feel really amped for a short period of time, and then have it fall by the wayside effectiveness-wise? Doubling it to 36 (and on my own to 54 a couple of times) just hasn't helped. Why was it so helpful at 18mg on the first 2 days, and just useless now?  Thanks folks, for whatever wisdom you've got. I really could use it.

When I was diagnosed as a kid, my mother went to some kind of information session.  She told me the person giving the session asked the audience (parents of newly diagnosed children) how many had children who couldn't whistle, and several raised their hands with much nervous giggling.  It has always sounded off to me, but at 30 I still can't manage much of a whistle, and neither can my wife, who also has ADD.  So I figured I'd ask.

First, a little context. I go to a very academicly challenging boarding school, and love it. I thrive in a busy environment (like many of you, I don't deal well with downtime). However I am having a lot of trouble doing my junior year AP US reading, it is very dry so it is really hard to concentrate. Every night we have about 20 pages of reading, and some nights I will start it and not finish it, other nights I won't even be able to start it. This is effecting my grade, I have a C/C+ average in AP US when in every other class (including other AP courses) I am in the B+ to A+ range.   I take 40mg of vyvanse every morning at around 7:30. This has worn off by the end of the day when I sit down to do the reading. Because of the hectic life of boarding school I don't have time to complete reading during the day, only in the evening once my meds have worn off. I really don't want to take more medication in the evening simply because it would screw with my already wacky sleep schedule. So are there any tricks that veterans of this class or others like it might have to share with me?

Went to a licensed psychologist after consluting with my general practice doctor. Went through all the official testing and was diagnosed.   Tried through therapy and books and all the tricks to kick it and that just didn't work. I was adament about wanting to avoid medication. I have read all about side effects and blah blah blah. But I just don't know if my fear of meds (I essentially think I'm going to lose my personality and become a walking zombie) is rational at all.

It's confirmed I have ADHD-PI and an anxiety disorder. As the first is no surprised, i was a bit shocked by the second one.   Also, with the evaluation I received recommendations to help me out.   1- Sleep more (get the 8 hours you need) 2- Exercise more (30 min daily) 3- Take breaks more often (while working or studying) 4- Meditation  Evaluator is not recommanding meds.   My first reaction : Shit, I did all this for that!!!   I was really, really, disappointed.  There was a time in my life where I did use all 4 recommendations, it helped a bit, but... not enough.   Also, I did really well in all test, IQ test overall was above average. The tests where I did not do good because of ADHD, I hit average. That's why I pass under the radar for so long.  I fear that because I hit average on some test, my ADHD won't be taken seriously. At least my SO is, which is alot for me. I also fear of going back to work (went back to college, I'm now 33) and falling back to the same patterns (over procrastination, late all the time, working at 25% of my potential, guilt).   I also talked to my mom, who I believe as ADD-pi too, however her reaction got me evermore frustrated. I receive the "I went thru it alright, you should to". Completely ignoring my struggle or acknowledging how difficult it can be.   **If you can I'd like some word of encouragement or wisdom, if you can afford it.**   **;TLDR; Received my DX ADD-PI with Anxiety disorder. Doc gives basic recommendation. I feel disappointed but meds not being recommended.  Great support by SO, poor by family.**

I have been recommended to go to the academic coaching and tutoring center, but have never been able to at any school.  I also avoid teacher/prof meetings like the black plague.  I dont really know why but i have.  Psychologist wants me to get a person to give me a kick in the ass to start work.  dreading that as well.  any ideas why i can't stand to get help? it seems to be an ADHD thing from what i have learned.  and suggestions on how to overcome it.

He said it's a relatively common thing that's done for autistic people with comorbid ADHD, and I was mostly just wondering if anyone else has tried the combination or knows much about it.  Thanks :)  edit: obviously I've talked it over with my psychiatrist, and I'm happy that it's a good enough idea for me to be comfortable trying it, and we talked about the pharmacology of it, etc - I'm mostly just curious for "how it feels" if anyone has taken it before; obviously taking into account that everybody's different.

A:"Hell if I know…" - Giving others concrete info on how to handle your ADHD;;;I'm a typical case of a late diagnosed female. College is what 'gave it away.' And while I've made progress through therapy and medication, there's been plenty of regression and setbacks.  Recently I've gone through a 'downturn' in focusing and accomplishing tasks and unfortunately my tendency is to hide from the world to escape judgement from others and delaying consequences. It's not something I'm proud of.  The good news is that this downturn seems to be shorter than usual, and it took me longer in the semester to stumble. Increments, yeah?  But when I've had the conversations - the ones where I hang my head and explain I screwed up again - people (family, friends, professors, co-workers, etc) always ask, "Let me know what we can do to help you." And I have no idea. I'm barely keeping my own shit together; figuring it all out by process of trial and error.  This brings me to my major question: What should I tell them? Is there anything my fellow redditors of /r/adhd have found to be helpful from your environment? The people in it?

Is it related at all? I just want to know how I can help him and understand what's going on. I mean, the obvious answer is to give him space, but I also get worried when I don't hear from him for a long time, since usually we talk or hang out every day.   Admittedly I don't actually know much about ADHD so maybe you guys could help me to understand what he's going through? How can I support him in general, also?  Thanks.

The first week I was instructed to take 18mg, then 36mg the following week, etc.. (until I find the right dosage).  This week was the 36mg week, and the first 2 days were kinda OK, but on the 3rd day my heart started pounding strongly I was feeling my heartbeat in an uncomfortable way, and it was the same way the 4th day (yesterday). So my psychiatrist told me to stop taking it today and see a cardiologist.  Has anyone had similar problems with Concerta that vanished after a while?   I didn't really realize the effect it had on me until today that I stopped taking it. It didn't help me focus as much as I thought it would (the doc did tell me that 36 mg is not a large dose for an 80kg adult), but without it I seem to get tired/sleepy very quickly and I find it hard to do homework.

Around last May i started to feel like it wasn't working as well as it used to, in August i got changed from 60mg a day to 70mg, and it didn't seem to help much.  The last couple months I've started feeling some anxiety and mood swings. At school I get distracted much more than i normally would, and have frequent day dreams. A couple weeks ago I had a huge anxiety attack. Also i feel a lot more stress than i usually do, and over react about little things.  I've told all of this to my doctor... but he still prescribes me to Vyvanse.  Why does he still prescribe me to Vyvanse? Should i just ask him to change my prescription?  Edit: Thank you all for the responses, i found it very helpful and are much appreciated :)  Edit 2: Just wanted to say i think its amazing that people care enough to give their insight

At the risk of sounding like a complete tree-hugger, has anyone ever experimented with daily meditation? I've read that you can train yourself to focus more easily, but I'm wondering if anyone has personal experience?  Also, just wanted to throw out there that this subreddit has literally been more helpful and informative for me than any other source, including my psychiatrist. Thanks for helping make this whole thing a litte easier. Just shelling out some feel good.
424025fa231a7a414fde096828d6fe39d031057cf5887813a7b3ecc309dd9a42;;;It makes so much sense.;;;I'm 15, generally intelligent, but always got awful grades. I have intentions to do things and honestly want to, but when it comes time to do it I never do. I downed a 5 hour energy and a redbull a few days ago, and my friends were like, 'how aren't you bouncing off the walls?' I thought it was always like it was, being focused, i could actually read things without doing something else, able to listen to people talk etc... I found out in people with adhd stimulants do the opposite and make you focus, so i told my mom and am probably going to get a test soon. I think it took so long for me to find out because i used to not have to read or pay attention to get good grades, so it was never a problem, until i actually needed to. Anyways wish me luck.
16b409d3bc3ff9dfd48af45e961d0423d4ab13ace1b827b236ab66d6f9a74244;;;Fellow ADHDers I need your opinion on a recent situation (warning lots of writing but I really need your help);;;I'm sorry if I keep starting threads too frequently. I mentioned before that I recently had a horrible panic attack while on my second day of concerta. So here's the situation: I live on residence in my university. I was at work sunday morning when I had my panic attack, mind you I've never experienced anything like that before. My heart rate was at 3 beats per second and it was irregular. My blood pressure was through the roof, my hands were numb I could barely move my fingers I honestly thought I was gonna die.   My friend was rushing me to the hospital because we didn't know what was going on. I didn't have my care card (insurance card) on me and I needed to see a doctor. I asked my friend and neighbor to call the CA on call (the person in charge of the building I live in) and ask them to let her in to grab my care card for me. They have a master key that works for all the rooms. Here is where it went to shit. They were very rude and uncooperative and they were STRESSING ME OUT making my panic attack WORST. I called them I could barely talk because I couldn't breath properly I'm like I NEED MY CARE CARD WHY WONT YOU HELP ME I DONT UNDERSTAND. The stupid girl (CA) is like sorry there's nothing I can do. At this point I'm in rage I feel like my ears are about to pop and as if they're on fire I can't move my fingers at all at this point. So naturally I lost my temper and started swearing I remember saying something along the lines of I swear to god I'll ruin your fucking life or something like that. And if anything happens to me its on you and I hang up.   She called her supervisor who called me and said that he would go into my room and read out my card number for me. Im under so much stress now I feel like my brain is about to explode and shut down. Anyway he did so I saw the doctor she calmed me down and said I'm having a panic attack etc etc...  So TODAY I get an email from the residence office saying that IM IN TROUBLE for swearing at the fucking CA and it's a violation of community standards or some shit and I have to go to a meeting to discuss my horrible crime. I'm honestly planning on having the biggest bitch fit because I sure as hell won't be able to control my temper.   From my point of view I did nothing wrong and I sure as hell won't apologize for them being uncooperative assholes who made my condition worse.  **tl;dr** had a panic attack tried to ask the people in charge of my dorm to help me with getting my insurance card. They were rude and uncooperative lost my temper started swearing and now I'm in trouble. Am I in the wrong or are they?

I explained it to a friend like this. "Imagine that my brain is a big jar of bees. The bees are thoughts, buzzing around and smashing into each other. Then, I want to send some your way, so the bees start flying through a straw to get out of the jar. Then two bees try to go into the straw at the same time, or out of order, and I have to wait and restart the stream of thoughts."  Another time, I explained it like so. "Imagine that thoughts are wires, like power cords. Most people have them neatly coiled, waiting to be thought about, or plugged in on both ends, neatly running from inspiration to conclusion. I instead have all of them running everywhere all the time. Plugged into splitters, combiners, plug strips, etc. When you want to think a thought into words, you just grab one and pull it out. I, however, have to untangle it from all the others. It takes a moment to separate it, because my mouth can only say one at a time."    Another time, I said this. "I think about things abstractly. I don't use words in my head. When I want to describe something, I have to isolate the whole thought, then carefully translate it into English. It's great, because I can think really fast. It just means I'm slow to share my thoughts."    TL:DR I (we!) are really smart, we just have to work to translate to English.

He also wrote the book "More attention Less Deficit" AND has expressed interest in doing an /r/ADHD AMA soon! ;;;I work for ADD Resources now (previously a volunteer) and have taken the initiative to start our twice-monthly webinars with ADHD experts for our members and the public.  It would be very cool to get a few extra listens from all my friends here at /r/ADHD!   ***  ###Description:  ADHD is a neurological condition, but **neurology often drives psychology**. This is especially true for many adults with ADHD who spent **most of their lives undiagnosed** and therefore untreated. As a result of this lifetime of additional struggles, they tend to develop certain mindsets and ways of relating to others.  While this may have played a protective role before the person is diagnosed, **finally getting appropriate treatment can be a real game changer in terms of what they are capable of.**  Unfortunately, some of those older mindsets may still persist and undermine their progress in getting their lives in order. **We will discuss how three of these common mindsets develop and how to shift to a more positive and productive mindset.**  ***  *After we get diagnosed and take medication, eventually discover that our negative thinking is holding us back. Ari will help you recognize this thinking and show you how you can start thinking more positively!*  ***  **[Find out what time this is for you](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=ADD+Resources+Ari+Tuckman+Webinar&amp;iso=20121127T18&amp;p1=391&amp;ah=1)**  Sorry Europe looks like this will be the VERY early morning, but you will be able to listen to the recording afterwards.

A few days ago I went to my normal family doctor for an ADHD diagnosis. I've been convinced I've had it for awhile... don't want to go into details, but pretty damn sure. Anyway, he reffered me to specialist group for evaluation. They have sent me new patient paper work to fill out, and I'm interested in some of the questions on the paper work.  There seem to be a lot of substance-abuse related questions, such as "Have you ever used or experimented with drugs or smoked marijuana?", and questions about how frequently I drink and stuff. The truth is, I've had a "problem" with alochol... and I've tried pretty much every drug there is (marijuanna, cocaine, meth, mdma, shrooms, list goes on...).   If I answer honestly on these questions, will that effect what treatment options are available to me? For instance, if I listed cocaine or meth and something I've done before, will that keep them from prescribing me a stimulant medication (something I'm interested in trying)? Or if I indicate I've had substance abuse problems in the past?  I'm not going to treatment to "fish" for meds for recreational use or anything of that nature... but I would like to try the commonly prescribed Adderal or perhaps Riddlin. I'm afraid if I list certain things in the paper work that they won't let me try it. I'm convinced the medication will help me because I actually have co-workers and friends who are prescribed it who say it worked wonders for their life.  tl;dr: Will a history of substance abuse / alcoholism keep me from getting prescribed stimulant medication?  Thanks for reading

7b6e3d1b58ac780783f97919bc8cdc69e198bebb0157ecfc67b7374c840ec62e;;;Question about first time doctor visit;;;I've been diagnosed with ADHD by a psychologist. My GP prescribes me medication. I called a therapist specializing in treatment today, and the first questions he asked me on the phone were: have you ever had a suicide attempt and (ugg, I forgot. It just happened 10 seconds ago... I think it had something to do with have I ever been hospitalized).  I said no to both, my question is why did he ask these and what would have happened if I said yes?   ---  As a follow up one of my close friends who hasn't been diagnosed but we both strongly suspect it went to a first time doctor visit. But she had been suicidal at a point and the doctor immediately turned her down for an assessment of ADHD (citing that it was commonly diagnosed before 7). The doctor completely ruled out stimulant medication due to her infrequent pot usage and history of alcohol abuse in her family (though she does not abuse alcohol).   Does anyone have explanations for the doctor's actions in both of these scenario's? The latter is more important, because we're both convinced her life would improve from medication, like mine has, but it seems like she's going to be shut out from it. Is there a strong rational for this? Should she be barred from stimulants, or even a diagnosis path to them?

I got Concerta and Ritalin. The first two days were ok. The third day I upped the dose as per doctors orders and I had a lot of anxiety. I also had headaches like my head was going to explode. My tinnitus got worse and all sound started to hurt me. I locked myself in my room. I just waited out this horrible feeling.  The horrific part is that I still feel really, really anxious, more than before, and it feels like I'll never be OK. I still get afraid when a sudden loud sound is made. This is four days after the last medication. I don't know what to do. I talked to my doctor and he says that my side effects are really strange. He gave me short acting anti-anxiety and sleep medication. He also said that I should try Strattera and that it might help. He also said that I could try anti anxiety meds but that they take really long time to work so I had to be sure before I take them.  Now I just take anti-anxiety meds and fall asleep and sleep a lot. Then when I wake up I start to feel very anxious and I take the med again and I fall asleep again. I don't know what else to do.  My family is really starting to get worried and I hate to do this to them.  I don't know what the strategy is here. My doctor said that I'm should take Strattera 40 mg on monday and onward. We see each other on tuesday and he said that we should discuss  anti-anxiety meds then. Won't Strattera make me more anxious, since it's a NRI? I don't know what to think anymore.  I looked up clonidine and guanfacine and I read that they help more with the panicky/anxious side of ADHD more then Strattera. However, my doctor can't prescribe them to me and he have to send it to me to another clinic for that.  Will Strattera help me with this? And more importantly, will I ever be ok? I feel like it's game over at this point. I've never felt this anxious in my life. Any tips? I'm ok with my ADHD not being completely treated if it means that I don't have to feel like this.

Here I go:   1. like many on here I have trouble focusing-surprising I know right?   2. I love playing games-especially minecraft  3. The interesting part is that I have trouble focusing on a single goal, as there is no "end goal" as well as any idea I have changes over time to the point thag I end up having NO idea what I was originally going for...and I feel kind of depressed/confused  4. I don't have anyone around of which I can ask to help me directly because they either don't have ADHD or they don't have the game  5. I want to make this into a let's play (uploaded to youtube) where our difficulties are present, unedited and instantly relatable...but we help each other and maybe learn something from it.  6. The great part is that we can truly SEE what any progress we make because...our progress is right there in front of us. Even if someone does not play the game they can see what we are going through and see the camaraderie we have in focusing and helping each other.  My question is: is there an interest here for a couple others to join me in a private server and make a lets play?    I do apologize if this is not the place to post this and any questions/suggestions are welcome and appreciated! If for some reason some has something to "rage" about please preface the comment with "rage:" so I can properly prepare myself. All in all I hope you all have a great day and thank you for the community's existence, the moderators effort, the member's involvent and mojang's/notch's fruitation.   Sincerely,  Hohnsenhoff

c4329cb01fece1bdb8b5b046784f4df80ab061c6df22a602fc4d9bca1b44816f;;;Diagnosed probably 10+ years ago, was medicated for awhile, but didn't like it.  College is getting hard, looking for some advice.;;;Basically when I was younger, got diagnosed, put on ritlin, had massive apatite loss, stopped taking it.  Went on focalin for a bit but after I got to college just stopped...  So, fast forward to today, I am a senior in college with reasonable grades, figured I might have overcome my adhd, but, after a random discussion with my mom, I reevaluated that statemet.   I am in one class this semester I am taking for the second time, the first time I audited it part way through so I can't measure my effort this time in any comparison, but I really am giving it all I got, and if the midterm is any indication that is not going to be enough.  My question is what should I be doing, if I don't pass this class, it will mess up everything bad enough I will probably drop out due to how things are scheduled and how I can't afford to stay for how this would impact things.  I could probably get another prescription from my doc but would that really do me any good without more time to see if it still even works on me?  The class is a proof based class, so it goes beyond memorization and more into getting into the frame of mind which is really difficult for me (hence the second time).  The idea of having to drop out because of one class has me more terrified than anything I have ever had to deal with before (i have a pretty nice life up till now I guess) and need every edge I can get to help me get through this final.  Any advice on this matter is welcome, I just don't know what I should do.  I have been putting in more man hours on this class than anything else in my college career and all I have to show for it is 7 more points on my midterm exam than I got last year.   tl;dr:been trying to manage adhd on my own the last few years, thinking it might not be enough,  What do?

After finding this out I noticed that my mother and aunt have symptoms that could be linked to ADHD but are overlooked because they are not promenent enough for a diagnosis.  With this in mind it got me thinking about how so many people in my mothers side of the family have ADHD like symptoms and it hit me, ADHD may be Genetic.  I believe ADHD is linked to the X Chromosome and its a Semi-dominant Allele that expresses parts of itself along side more dominent alleles. With this hypothesis it would explain why ADHD is more prominent in males and why its been passed down through my family like it has.  Does anyone else have a thoughts on my hypothesis?  Edit: Words

First off, let me say that I've been a long term lurker on /r/ADHD and I've loved all the advice that people post. It's helped me realize about myself and work on overcoming it. People don't realize how difficult life can be with ADHD.  Anyways, I'm currently a graphic design student and our next project is to design a list typographically using information that may people may not know about or want to research. Obviously I've decided to do mine on facts about ADHD but I haven't been able to find any facts online to use. Would anyone be able to point me to a reputable source? I was thinking more along the lines of things that most people don't know about ADHD.  I'm sorry for the book but I've been helped a lot by this subreddit and hopefully my poster will help people to understand more about ADHD.  Edit: Thank you everyone for your feedback. I was thinking hopefully we could find a place to post things that we find. Maybe interesting facts in one place and then something I could use for a list in another. Would anyone be interested in helping me out? I promise to help out with some design work if you need any done.

Anyone ever questions their ADHD?;;;Something just unlocked my suppressed thoughts and feelings and I feel like it's time to get it out.  ADHD background: Unconfirmed. Saw psychiatrist back in college(on my last year), showed symptoms of ADHD, but unable to determine as he needed a psychologist to conduct tests in order to diagnose me. Tests were expensive, I had no insurance, didn't take test. Given adderall as a trial, was approved of refills, graduated and ran out of pills.  Here's my story: The topic of ADHD came up when I felt like I was beginning to have troubles of concentration in school and had a talk with my cousin who was diagnosed ADHD and taking medications for it. She explained to me that ADHD kind of ran through our family, through our fathers side of the family. Our fathers are brothers and they both have similar cases of short temperness and aggression, which she says is because of ADHD. Their mind can't grasp or comprehend something get irritated and therefore begin to develop a temper and turn their aggression towards others on little things. Basically she says I should check with a specialist to see if I have it too since I'm not doing well in school. After I saw my psychiatrist and was given a prescription. I really felt like "Wow. I guess I really have it, because I'm holding these pills." But reaching deeper into my feelings and thoughts I think I might have only try to justify myself getting these pills by saying I have ADHD. I remember feeling like the pharmacist at the school health center thinking "Here's another kid trying to lazy his way into boosting his scores." I feel the same thing coming from my mother and wife. Like they think that I'm lazy, unmotivated, not trying hard enough, wasting my time on certain things when I should be studying/doing homework, therefore using these pills to cheat doing something I already could but lazy to try and put effort. It really makes me feel worthless, incompetent, and all those things I think they think of me. Maybe I'm just being paranoid. Then again, my mother does ask me to try and not use the pills, just try to focus better. And my wife (girlfriend at the time), when I told her I was going to see the psychiatrist about the pills, I think she did say that I didn't need to and I just need to try harder, that I'm gonna get prescribed and try to whore out attention from my friends that I'm smart but I just have ADHD etc. (for a guy I do like bringing attention to myself, but this... if I were to bring attention to myself like that, it would just be disgustingly inhumanly low. But I don't want people to know, because I know people don't understand it and tend to think "it's not ADHD, it's laziness." and I don't want people especially my friends to think that of me.) She did say something along the lines of "You're doing ok in class, and I'm doing same as you. So if you can do better but have ADHD then what am I? Stupid?" I don't remember how I replied to that, if at all.  My realization: Once in awhile in the back of my head, I wonder and ask myself whether if I really have ADHD. Maybe my mother and wife is right, maybe I am just lazy, maybe I could try harder. I feel guilty every time I'm stuck unable to focus or concentrate and I'm thinking I need more pills. I feel like I'm a weak being. I currently don't have any more pills because I'm waiting for my insurance, and once it starts to kick in I can see a psychiatrist and get a refill. Whenever I mention this to my wife of this, I get this look and body posture from her along with a teeth sucking noise as if saying "You don't need the pills, you're just lazy and using it as an excuse." and I think "Yeah, you're right, I'm lazy."  My question: How many of you have felt like this or experienced similar events thinking everyone is judging you? How have you cope/resolved if at all?

As a result, I have had numerous written warnings and bad reviews regarding my attention to detail/work product/performance/etc. I hit bottom a month ago and made my psych appointment, I was diagnosed with ADHD and I’m now on Wellbutrin and Concerta and doing much better.   My problem, however, is that the people on the interview panel have known me for so long and they know of the problems I’ve had while I’ve been working here. I didn’t advertise my ADHD diagnosis, so for all they know I’ve just been a lazy, distractible, untrustworthy employee.   It’s still a struggle at times, but I’ve definitely been doing better since I’ve been medicated. How do I explain to the panel that I’m now worthy of this new job? I don’t really feel comfortable telling them “oh, well that was before I was medicated” in response to any questions about my past performance, but I also don’t really have any other reason as to why I’m all of a sudden a better worker.   If anyone has done this before, I’d love some advice.   Thanks!   **TL;DR**  Been a shit employee due to undiagnosed ADHD, now medicated and better, how do I explain why I deserve a new job to an interview panel of people who know me as a shit employee?

Dear Mom/Dad,  I love y'all so much and your support has been amazing throughout my life. This semester, I messed up bad. Y'all have done everything to help me succeed and i blew it. Im not blaming my performance on my ADHD, Ive gotten through 6 semesters of college without medication, but this time i need help. I want a doctor/psychiatrist to talk to me about my disorder. When i was diagnosed i was very young, and i have little understanding of my disorder. This semester, I fell apart losing the focus to clean, study, have a conversation. It was all extremely depressing. I pushed away my anxiety about the math class by ignoring it completely. My inability to focus is crushing me. I feel as if I've wasted away my potential. Im not depressed, but i have some issues i need to workout. Im incredibly sorry for my performance this semester, I wanted y'all to know whats up because you've been great at supporting me.

dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;ADHD Parents: do you find yourself projecting your symptoms on your children?;;;Last week I had a teacher meeting with my son's pre-school (he's 4 years old). While generally he got a good report, there were a couple of flags that reminded me of myself growing up. Having been diagnosed and treated for the first time at age 32, I've thought a lot about the pros/cons of a later in life diagnosis. With my son however, I'll know better to be on the lookout and will have to decide if/when to medicate (should he actually have ADHD).  The things they said which stood out aren't a huge deal, but they are things like: he's in his own world a lot, he is in a constant state of imaginative play, plays in this imaginary world a lot by himself (less so with other kids), and while he's very smart, he doesn't actually seem to be paying attention to "lessons" during circle time (in his own world during lessons, doesn't participate).  I don't know if I'm projecting my own experience (daydreamer, in my own world, didn't pay attention, bored in school, etc.) on him or just oversensitive to the ADHD criteria. How do other parents deal with these types of things as your kids get older? Thanks!
fce845b99a10c500789ab36fa149107022b989ae7c98306f5974c9c1e4983147;;;Wanting opinions. Could this possibly be ADHD-I?;;;I've been cursing myself for my social anxiousness for years now. Never talkative. Awkward as all hell. I just sit there in my own mind, while everyone else interacts and has great conversation. I sit back and observe what is going on in the conversation, and very rarely feel like i can contribute. I've been quiet my entire life...I feel like I'm a lesser level of a human...whereas normal people see each other and can communicate with ease and understand each other, when I come into contact with somebody, I feel dumb and on a lower level of intelligence with them.   Also: I used to get really nervous when talking to people. My back starts sweating and my face gets really red. This has gone away for the most part recently, unless the situation is EXTREMELY awkward. During my normal every day awkward encounters, I still get anxious and have no clue what to say, but i don't get the hot and sweaty effects.  Months ago, possible maybe a year or more, I lightly considered that I may have ADD, because of my problems with paying attention in school and forcing myself to do work that I don't want to do with no success and constant procrastination of EVERYTHING. I quickly dismissed the idea though, as I was in denial and believed I was just a lazy piece of ****, because my social symptoms were way worse and I was mainly focused on those, so I believed that I may have social anxiety. Now, though, I believe that my social anxiousness might be a side effect from a form of ADHD.  A week ago, my sister's friend came over to my house and gave my buddy a few 70mg vyvanse. My friend didn't really want them, and left them at my house. I was tired one day and kind of just said screw it and took one to see what would happen. I was surprised about the effects that it had on me..  He called them 'speeders' which I guess is the slang term for prescription stimulants. I was expecting to feel extremely caffeinated or something of the sort, just filled with loads of energy, and I expected to be very hyperactive. I was wrong.  About an hour and a half to two hours after I took a dose (I opened the capsule up and took 35mg instead, might as well be "safe") I started feeling the effects. I felt a great ability to focus on anything that I wanted to. I truly felt that if I was working on anything, or playing a video game, or engaged in any activity really, that I would not have to worry about distractions or putting off what I was doing. I felt focused and in control of my actions. This was amazing, as I felt like I could actually be productive with my time and do something with myself.  The secondary effect was that I could actually be social. Usually when I'm sitting around with somebody, or riding in the car with someone, it'll either be mostly silence, or a slight bit of conversation with a lot of long pauses in between (and that's when I'm comfortable with you.) On the vyvanse, though, I can talk fluently and effectively. I actually went two whole car rides with no silence, just conversation the whole way. In a way, it was enthralling to be interested in the conversation and engaged, it was so new for me.  Last night, I took a whole 70mg with my friend that had originally received them. He planned on speeding, and I wanted to just try a higher dosage to see what happened. I informed him prior to this that I thought the pill helped me function correctly. We played some Zombies on Call of Duty for most of the night. We took the pills at around 10:30 pm. They started to kick in at around midnight for me, and I had the same feelings as before. I could concentrate and focus on what I was doing, and I was happy and talkative. We played until 8am, and I was able to hold constant conversation until around 7 or 7:30, then I started to get silent again. On another note, too, we both did a lot better than normal on the video game, haha. I was able to think my actions through and perform better instead of relying on instinct and impulsive actions to get through levels.  So, I was just wanting your thoughts and opinions on the subject. I plan to pursue this farther. I've been reading up on a lot of the symptoms and signs of ADHD Inattentive and I seem to fit the bill in a lot of places, but lack in some others.   If you need to know anything more about me, or want some questions answered, feel free to ask. I want to have a fruitful discussion about this topic, because I feel it may be a problem for more people than just me. Something life-changing could be sitting right under my nose, I just need to know if it is too good to be true.  Edit: Also, I apologize for the essay, this is the longest thing I've posted online in my life
e181059b902ea8d09ff5fb795828880b9770097d8086fe4fdf8507cf51ac5ac0;;;Does anyone here know anything about/have SCT?;;;Has anyone here ever heard of SCT (sluggish cognitive tempo)? I was diagnosed as ADHD inattentive my senior year of high school, but most of what read about ADHD doesn't seem to wholly apply to me or leaves out my worst symptoms. This SCT condition seems to perfectly describe me so far. Does anyone know anything about it? I am having a really hard time in college, and most of the advice i find is geared toward ADHD with hyperactivity. Any info or advice you guys could provide would be a huge help.

How do I bring this up to my doctor?;;;I have had increasing issues since I was in highschool, but back then everyone just told me " it's all in your head. you are just being lazy. get over yourself".  My 8 yr old was recently diagnosed ADHD and started meds and is doing much better.  During the course of talking with his doctor, I have come to realize that a lot of his symptoms are similar to what I have experienced my whole life.  My question is, how do I bring this up to my doctor? I am on meds for depression and at first they helped, but as the weeks go on i find them  working less and less. I am so frustrated because I am at a point in my life where I feel I should be able to function in a way that I can not. My best friend just brushes it off as stress, which I do have a lot of, but I think it is more. I am afraid that my doctor will do the same thing and that if he brushes it off that I might not have the courage to go to someone else and present this.  Any help on how to bring this up to my doctor would be appreciated!

I feel kind of weird that I'm an adult, almost like I'm not ready for that (even though it's been years). ;;;I'm not even sure I can articulate that feeling, but.. maybe some of you can.  I should clarify the title:  I was **diagnosed with ADHD-PI** a few years ago(which **could be Sluggish Cognitive Tempo**).  I've had many of the symptoms and coming to this subreddit has been an incredible experience, finding people just like me.     That being said, I was recently (2 or 3 weeks ago) finally tested and found out that **I have extremely low testosterone**.    I have no idea what is causing the low T, or how long it's been an issue, so now I'm **unsure whether I have ADHD-PI, SCT, or if Low T is causing all of my issues and always has**.

I was previously diagnosed by a psychologist with ADHD-PI and my psychologist sent the write up (or whatever paper it is that says I have ADHD) to the psychiatrist. However, this psychiatrist said I didn't really "fit" the diagnosis for ADHD and I was more likely depressed or something. This was making me very mad that he didn't think that I had ADHD, and on top of that he was kind of being a jerk. He finally gave in and gave me a prescription and said "we'll see if this helps" or something along those lines.   Granted it's the first day, I feel pretty good. Much more focused and I'm less fidgety(I actually could keep still while watching TV!). I don't feel hyper, which is a good sign. My mouth and throat are slightly dry, and my stomach has a little cramping, but I think there are very few side effects. It's 1:43pm and I have a small appetite so I might have a little something for lunch, too.  I was pretty scared to start taking it because I thought it wouldn't work and I didn't have ADHD, but it seems to be working great. Hopefully it continues to go well.

I generally suffer from "nice guy syndrome" but hell, sometimes if I feel wronged I can't even stop to think about whether I should rage about it or not. i can become scathingly bitter at people, and after I've usually jumped to the conclusion that I need to let someone know they're being an asshole I end up having to apologize for being an asshole...  -medications other than weed and caffeine consistently make me feel like shit physically and emotionally, and often times I can't get into the right state of mind before I take them and then I'll end up focusing on some bullshit like reddit or videogames or cleaning my room  -whenever i'm doing something really important that requires a lot of focus, I'll constantly be bombarded by thoughts of how what i'm doing isn't worth my time and there's probably an easier/better way to accomplish some sort of success in my life, and then I'll suffer from cognitive dissonance, either sitting in a state of limbo, accomplishing nothing, or instead running with my novel ideas of doing things differently, getting completely off track while feeling like I may have "figured it all out" but usually i just end up feeling very off track  -generally feeling like people don't understand my problems/think they aren't real problems  -communicating with people can be difficult sometimes, especially in person. for some reason typing messages to people feels like i'm making much more sense. I think sometimes I'll just let words fly out of my mouth before I've entirely thought out my idea, especially if i'm ranting.  -i'm always terrible at talking at the right time in conversations,especially in big groups but even just one on one. i can't help but blurt out my thoughts before the other person is done talking, and in a big group i'll normally just end up staying quiet because i can't find the right time to jump in.  -i always feel the need to rehearse conversations in my head before i have them with people. i can't just walk up and talk to someone, i have to meditate on it before i feel comfortable.  -in the relative quiet of the evening i find my mind becomes extremely restless and i can never fall asleep, often ending up researching everything and anything that makes me feel like i'm "on to something" that is going to be my key to success. i'll usually end up watching netflix to distract myself from these many thoughts that almost plague me at night.  -spacing out constantly, all the time. constantly falling into daydreams. i'm so good at this people don't even notice, often causing me to miss out on entire conversations as i just nod my head at those who think i'm listening to them.  -i crave the state of hyperfocus, and i don't know if it is healthy  -i usually feel scatterbrained or fixated  -i tend to rant about things  -it takes me a LONG-ASS TIME to do paper and pencil tasks, especially math, and writing papers, and the anxiety i experienced from this in school caused me to be math-phobic which sucks because now i feel like a functional retard. it makes me want to go back and take a long-ass time to go and learn that shit from the ground up but i don't know if it would be a waste of time or not. i think i will though because i think i need to. also all my math tutors made me feel like even more of a retard because i was so goddamn slow with them peering over my shoulder the whole time, the anxiety made it worse. so i just gave up and scraped by with D's.   -i'm an insuffrable perfectionist to the point where i'll just not do, or give up on  things that i don't feel i've completely mastered  -lately, when i'm not in a state of manic novelty driven focus, or sluggishly depressed about blowing my parents money on failing miserably at school, i'm just bored as hell.  ....YEAH that felt good  can anyone relate? i don't care if you can, it still felt great to get that out.  edit: thank you for all your words, you beautiful souls.

After recently taking more than prescribed on many occassions (1 extra b/c was either not "feeling" the effects, or was just in a poor enough mood resulting in not noticing its effects), and being left at the end of the month with 10 days without pills, thus increased amounts sleeping and getting little-to-no work done at work...I've decided to ask my doctor--based on my family's suspicions, opposite my own--if we were right with the diagnosis in the first place.  So...I've been given a name and number to call tomorrow to setup an appointment with a doctor who will administer a 2 hour computerized assessment to see if my issues are ADHD related and/or if there are other problems therein.  **If I see an interest** in a follow-up on the details, assessment, results, med change, etc...**then there will be more on the story as it develops.**  Stay tuned...**and feel free to ask questions in the mean time!**  *Also*...I've made the switch back to Vyvanse 70mg, *once-a-day* again, just until we get the test results.  **FINAL EDIT: I finally scheduled my appointment tomorrow, at 1pm. I'll follow-up after testing is through, or as questions are posted.**  **Ok...I guess *this* will be the final edit until I get my results. THE TEST: *see "My psych eval" comment* below.**

I do exhibit mild OCD behaviors daily, especially around organizing very specific things like those plates, which I have to stop and rearrange anytime I find he's put them in the wrong order.  I read that there's some co-morbidity between the two disorders, but mostly in men, not women. Does anyone have any more anecdotal experience, or even just good articles?  I don't understand how my brain and house can be such a mess, but something as little as the colors of stacked plates are so important I can't let it go for five seconds.

The whole "12-hours of euphoria and motivation" effect that I had when I started out with the medication has basically completely subsided at this point, and I've been having a very difficult time coping with it.   Recently, I've been having a lot of trouble both concentrating on and just starting my school work, in addition to avoiding exercise. I still feel some of the intended effects such as concentration, but only for a period of 3 or 4 hours after the pill fully kicks in (which usually take about an hour and a half for me). After that, the effects basically aren't there. It just feels genuinely as if my dose of Vyvanse has simply lost its effectiveness, even though I know that the highest prescribed dose is 70mg.   I've read a fair amount of experiences online in which people notice that taking multi-vitamin supplements have increased the effectiveness of their Vyvanse. I couldn't find any specifics as to which are more effective, but the general consensus seems to be to just take a multi-vitamin.   My question is, to those who take or have taken Vyvanse with a multi-vitamin supplement, does the supplement actually increase the effectiveness of the medicine and/or help in treating your ADD/ADHD? If so, are there any specific supplements that you'd recommend for someone experiencing a decrease in the effectiveness of their 60mg Vyvanse prescription?  Thanks, /r/ADHD!

Backstory: I recently got up the courage to tell my dad I was seeking treatment (ie, meds) for ADHD, because all the coping strategies in the world and self-regulated behavioural conditioning never worked - I seriously tried everything, nothing ever improved. My doctor agreed and gave me a referral. It took me several months to tell my dad this, because the entire family (both sides) are fairly anti-medication.  When I told him, he was shockingly calm about the subject and only requested I speak to his father (who is a medical doctor) about the possible side-effects of medication before starting any. I agreed. Tonight after speaking to my grandfather, he simply laughed it off and told me the very idea is ridiculous and I don't have ADHD. His reasoning? Because my university overall GPA is a 3.85. He even said, "Now if it was something like 1.35, then we can talk."   Only me, my roommate, and a very few select friends know how HARD maintaining a good GPA is for me; it's only doable for now because so far, most of my classes have been gen eds and I'm reasonably intelligent enough to get good marks in spite of NEVER starting a project or homework on time, ALWAYS frantically finishing said projects/HW the night before it's due (and I frequently have to request extensions), and BARELY skidding past finals with As. It's nerve-wracking, yet I'm not able to fix it myself, even if I get my roommate to frigging mother me and stand over me to force me to do work.  I seriously want to scream. I'm tired of my concerns about my own health (and sanity, I feel like I have no control over my own life and relationships) being dismissed because someone bloody knows more than I do. Well it's my body, don't I know more about that?!  We're all meeting over at grandpa's house tomorrow for a pre-New Year's gathering, and grandpa said he'd talk to me (more like AT me) more about it then. Reddit, help me - what do I say to advocate for myself? I don't need his approval, I'm an adult and will ultimately do what I think is best for me, but I don't want to alienate him or dad by acting completely dismissive of his "expert advice".  **TL;DR - I have ADHD, grandpa-the-doctor doesn't agree since my GPA is high, how do I stand my ground without insulting him?**

What are some of the tips you would like to share.   1) I am hitting a wall with my advisor, who is annoyed with the procrastination.  2) I almost always hit the deadline paper submission deadlines without completion. The I either send a paper unfinished or dont send it at all. It has been very frustrating.  3) I have always end up over committing to a number of projects and end up disappointing people.  4) I have maintained a list of ideas that I have had. The problem is I have never published any one them.   Its my 5th year and I want to finish this and get on with a real life and real job!   EDIT: I am not yet officially  diagnosed, although I have had the symptoms growing up until now. The psychological counsellor at my university has asked me to join the  group counselling esp for ADHD in my university in the coming semester   I am specifically looking for advice on coping with the symptoms without medication.   EDIT 2: Thanks you r/ADHD for such wonderful advice. I think I have found what I was looking for . [EricKnow's](http://www.reddit.com/user/EricKow) [ADHD toolbox](http://kowey.net/adhd-toolbox/) has a useful set of things that will work with getting things done.
ed61d288f52a64da350f3a54a5968ea19ac65da8259c528cae0249e2f144ca96;;;If i'm not allowed to "self diagnose"myself, then how can i expect to be diagnosed? ;;;(Its late and i'm a shitty writer so you can just skip to the TL'DR if you want. And I'm sorry for all the spelling mistakes, i really don't want to correct them all right now, i'm sure you will manage.)   I am almost certain that i have ADHD-PI, but no one else believes me.    Ironically enough, it started when i was reading an ask reddit post about how people with disorders like ADHD hate it when people self-diagnose. while reading I realized that i really did not know what ADHD was, so out of curiosity I serched it up on Wikipedia. with some more research i realized that i could relate to every single symptom of ADHD-PI. I then started reading about it on other sites, and sure enough, i felt like i had written down the symptoms myself.    Anyway, i eventually started telling people that. The usual response is:   me: "im pretty sure i have add, i can relate to all the symptoms"  them: "where did you read about these symptoms"  me: "websites on the internet"  them: "half the things on the internet are fake you know, stop being lazy and just do work"   or   me: (ditto)  them: You know, anyone can look at a list of symptoms and say that it sounds like them. thats why they dont   let people self diagnose themselves, because then everyone would say they have it."   or something like that.    Needless to say, it annoys me very much.    the reason why i want to get some sort of treatment so badly is because i feel like i could be achieving much more than i am right now.    I feel like i understand concepts that are taught to me so much quicker and better than other people. During a lesson in school, everyone else spends the time moaning about how hard or complicated it is. even though i find it easy to understand, i still mess up everything though. as a result, i have an average of 77 in grd. 10, but i feel like i should be getting 90s, considering the fact that i usually dont start assignments until 10:00 the night before, nor do i study for tests 90% of the time.    i could go on about all my problems but as I have stated before, they are clearly outlined in every website explaining what ADHD is.   sry for the ramble, what im looking for is ideas. I may not have ADHD, but what I just want to make sure. I dont want to beat myself up trying to concentrate on everything just because other people dont want to listen to me. So back to my original question, how do i convince my parents to get me an appointment with a doctor so that i can know for sure?    TL;DR: I am almost certain that i have ADHD-PI, but no one else believes me. How do i overcome this problem?

I take meds for both and they help a lot. However I can never seem to get myself to do work at home. The thought is something near terror at the thought and I feel it would be better if I played video games instead. But this also causes an issue because i become conflicted and depressed. I choose games over work because it is easier to do. I always understand work and if i don't I don't have an issue asking the teacher for help. I have issues telling other people directly want my problems are and try to drop hints best I can but never can get it out quite right. Shear terror ensues if i do try to directly tell someone.

But my boyfriend does and since he started medicating for it I'm worried our relationship is dying.;;;The title basically sums things up, but here are the details. Due to difficulties with work and school, my boyfriend (in his early 30s) started taking Strattera in early November. He quickly improved in work and school, and life was wonderful.  But alongisde improvements there came a whole list of side effects - constant lethargy, decreased appetite, but the ones that are killing me is that his affectionate and sexual sides are basically gone. We had a talk a couple weeks ago that ended in an ultimatum - either we find another solution to his ADHD or I was done. A couple weeks ago he switched to Adderall, but his ability to be affectionate hasn't come back. We've had sex twice since early November.  To put it mildly, I'm having trouble dealing. I'm doing my best to be patient and supportive while the old medication flushes out and he gets on the new one, but all this makes me feel completely undesirable. I need to feel like things are going to get better, like the guy I was with the last year is still in there and what I'm seeing is just side effects that will go away. I've talked to him about it, but I feel lost and in this alone.

Feel free to read only the bolded text and/or the tl/dr at the end!**   **I'm on a waiting list for a psychologist &amp; psychiatrist in depth assessment** for possible ADHD. At least 4 weeks until they call me to set up an appointment. After doing quite a bit of research, **I highly suspect that I have ADHD as well as some depression &amp; anxiety.**  The thing is, I am really struggling, have been for at least a year with ADHD like syptoms. I have huge demands at work, and despite religious use of todo lists I can't get anything done (or started). I'm constantly forgetting things at work, sometimes with disastrous consequences. I can't find motivation to do anything but the simplest tasks (and if I try to tackle anything big, I can never finish it).  Home life is similar but not really bothering me since I live alone. **Work life scares me because I've been given huge responsibilities over the last year and I'm not sure I can handle them.**  **I'm pretty sure I could see my family doctor and have drugs-in-hand by tomorrow** (for depression, anxiety, ADHD, whatever I ask for considering my symptoms). He went through the classic ADHD check-list when I asked him for a referral and checked just about everything off (except hyperactivity). **But that just doesn't seem wise**, given the possibility of misdiagnosis, and the fact that I have a much more in-depth assessment with ADHD trained professionals, if I can just make it through the next month or two.   4+ weeks seems like 10 years to me right now. **Can /r/adhd give me some helpful suggestions, feedback, anything** to help me get through the next few weeks, when it feels like everything is about to come crashing down on my head?   **tl/dr; assessment in 4 (or more) weeks. Not sure if I can wait, not sure what to do!** (not looking for self-medication, medical advice. Doing this all 'by the book').

Whenever I talk to people about it, its almost always talked about like its not a real serious problem, or its not a real thing at all. Almost like a term for someone to use if they think someone is stupid, or not paying attention.   I feel like this may be attributed to how add/adhd is/was over diagnosed. or maybe the term itself has been so overused.   even on reddit, ive seen topics in other threads where add/adhd is just treated like some unreal thing, an excuse. idk any one else get this?  edit: not trying to say people should feel more sorry for people with adhd. but for example, if someone notices something different in my work habits, and i attribute it to my add, it usually seems like not a good enough answer for most people.

I was diagnosed with ADD as a child, but ADD doesn't cover all of the mental issues I have.   Now, I take one 10mg instant release addy a day, since last year, as a senior in high school today. It used to be on weekdays only, I'd use the weekend as a short break from its heavy effects on me. I used to deal with the teeth clenching the robot feeling etc. etc. etc. side effects. Now I'm left with the cold hot sweats in the middle of the night and I'm balanced out on it, and now I pretty much need it to function. I spend all of my time on school at the sacrifice of it, and I'm starting to realize this wasn't worth it, it wasn't worth the graduation of high school to erode and decay my mind. I'm not on it today for the first time in a long time. I'm afraid to get off of it, because then I won't seem normal to everyone else. That, and the last time I was off of it for three days, I had scary thoughts........ok....I don't feel like writing anymore.

What was the etiquette for doing so? I know if you just switch doctors for other reasons, they can send over all the notes and medical history from the last one, but since this guy technically isn't a doctor anymore I'm not sure if that would work, or if I would just need to start new...The latter makes me nervous as I'm two days from starting college again.    The reasons for him losing the licence are pretty unrelated to his medical practice by the way, not like he was giving out bad diagnosis or anything.

I was diagnosed as a kid with ADHD and I stopped taking meds on my own volition around when I was in 7th grade from hearing a lot of hubbub about the medication/ probably feeling weak about it. I've had a couple more experiences trying to get back on meds. Anyway, I just wanted to say it's really nice seeing that I'm not alone in how I experience the world!

Please share (positive or negative)!;;;I am 25 years old, had ADHD since I was a kid but just got diagnosed. Once I acknowledged I had ADHD I began to realize that certain behaviors really impacted my relationship.  I am dating a really sweet girl, but she is so calm and a home-body type  etc I can't stand it some times. She is wonderful, but doesn't have that same need for stimulus that I have.   As I look back, most of the things we disagree about (or very rarely fight about) stem from this in some way.   Has anyone else with ADHD experienced this, and do you have advice on working through it? Any thoughts on perhaps needing to be with someone with a more energetic nature?
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Nicotine works better than any prescription ever did for my ADHD.;;;I was first diagnosed with ADHD when I was around 9 years old. In middle school and high school, I went through a variety of prescriptions, including Strattera and Adderall. The Strattera it turns out made me suicidal, so I got switched to Adderall until I couldn't take the emotionless zombie effect and I stopped taking it of my own accord junior year in high school.   I'm now a sophomore in college and have been struggling with my symptoms ever since I stopped taking the meds. I managed to earn good grades, but it would be a constant struggle for me to focus and stay on task, especially in classes where there was no set structure. Completing homework assignments in a timely fashion was nearly impossible. It would take me forever to fall asleep at night because I couldn't shut off the damn static.  I never smoked, but about a month ago, I tried what's known as an electronic cigarette. It is meant to be a healthy alternative to smoking cancer sticks, it contains only vegetable glycerin, propylene glycol, nicotine, and flavoring (which are all recognized as safe by the FDA) thus there are no carcinogens and it won't damage your lungs. Additionally, without the MAOI's and other chemicals in cigarettes, the nicotine in e-cigarettes is only as addictive as caffeine, so you won't develop an addiction or feel deprived if you go long periods without using it.  Anyway, I found that the nicotine cleared up all my ADHD symptoms as well if not better than Adderall, without the terrible side-effects. For the first time in years I have been able to focus on a task I wanted to do and complete it without distraction. My mind is so much less cluttered and I can think and focus clearly. When I go to bed now, I fall asleep 5 minutes or less after my head hits the pillow. This discovery has improved my quality of life so many times over.   Well, that is my story, just thought I would share.

Anyhow, I saw a commercial (when I was a Junior in College) about ADD and thought that I had a lot of symptoms, pressed the issue with her and she confessed that I had been diagnosed with it when I was younger.  Anyhow, I went on and off meds, I was never really able to have a consistent doctor and thought that I could take myself off scripts on my own when I got frustrated with my doctors.  As I've gotten older, I've realized that it is still a major problem and affects me significantly. I feel that I'm mature enough to see a doctor in the proper manner and get real help.  The only down side is now I've gotten to the point where I have a job that doesn't provide health insurance and highly doubt that I can afford to get proper treatment.  I've had comorbidly with depression, alcoholism, and possible brief periods of mania (but they may or may not have been related to Delirium Tremens)   I've taken Adderall in regular and XR forms, it helped a bit but I ended up taking myself off of it because I didn't like the side affects.  I've also taken Zoloft, Wellbutrin and Effexor for depression without a lot of success.   I haven't had adequate resources available and partially irresponsible when I was younger which led to not having developed relationships with a mental health provider with whom I felt I could trust and work through the side effects of various drugs.   I realize that my coping mechanisms which have gotten me through my ADHD-Pi burdened life thus far aren't enough and that if I got proper help that I'd be able to become a lot more successful.  I'm not broke, but I don't take home a ton of money. Ideally I'd like to keep the expenses as low as possible, but I could pay an initial evaluation as well as monthly expenses of $200-400 I think.  I'm kind of pharmaceutical adverse but would be willing to keep trying some new meds, preferably non-stimulants or even alternative therapies that people have gotten help from.  I live just north of NYC.  Do you guys have any suggestions of where to start?

(Sorry it's so long!);;;Hi, I have an appointment for my son to get an insurance referral, but in the meantime I wanted to see what you folks thought about my son, it's also a way to help me get my thoughts in order. Please ask Q's and I'll edit this part as necessary!  I'm not asking for a diagnosis-I'll let the docs do that, just looking for any thoughts.   -Orphaned shortly after his birth in China, most likely due to his cleft lip/palate  -lived in an orphanage until 19 months when we were lucky enough to adopt him and bring him back to the US  -Cleft lip/palate surgeries were successful  -Has developmental delays due to orphanage life (that's normal) and no apparent cognitive disabilities at this time (can sing his ABCs, has a big vocabulary, etc, can be taught to do things)  -Went to speech therapy for a year and is now "caught up" to his peers  -goes to physical therapy because he favors one leg, but is evening out there.  -has a "lazy eye" that has been getting better through strengthening (Wears a patch for a few hours...he hates that)  -has a big sister (7 years) and a new baby brother (5 months)   Now for the ADHD part:  We have always kind of wondered if he might have this, but he was so young and so new to our family, was going through so many changes, that we wanted things to settle out a bit.  A lot of people say "3 year old boys are fidgety and crazy, that's normal" but my gut tells me he's not.  He is not a mean person or malicious, I should point that out.  All of his annoying/obnoxious behavior really seems to be an unconscious decision for him.  He doesn't abuse himself (bang head on wall if he doesn't get his way, etc)  -Constantly interrupts.  We will politely remind him no to interruprt and then continue our conversation and he can usually "hold it" but he can never remember to do this.  -Always says "what?" when you ask him to do something or give him an answer to a Q he asked, but it's obvious that he heard you.  We will say "I already told you" and then he'll acknowledge it or repeat our answer.  it's maddening to hear him constantly say whatwhatwhat, but we're getting better about not repeating ourselves.  -When we need to ask him to do something, we have found that we have to say "look at me" and then say what we need as soon as he looks at us, he only looks at you for about 2-3 seconds and then his eyes are already roving. I watch his eyes closely and it looks like he has googly eyes sometimes, it's not like he's focusing on the toy he has or the food he was eating, he'll look at you and then just start looking everywhere.  -Unless he is completely exhausted, it takes him about 30-60 minutes to fall asleep at night, no matter what bedtime we have tried. while falling asleep he talks and sings to himself almost nonstop.  Every night.  We tried moving him into a room with his big sister but it didn't work because he was keeping her up at night, and waking her up every morning.  He cannot lay in bed in the dark and be quiet.  -Has constant crying fits.  Gets frustrated easily and then devolves into laying down on the floor on his belly screaming and crying.  If I tell him to stand up and act like a big boy and stop crying he will more or less do it. (an example: trying to shove a nerf ball into a too-small box: *shoves and shoves and is grunting and his face is all twisted up while loudly saying "c'mon!"*  If my daughter had ever done that she would have realied that the ball just won't fit and would do something else.  There was no reason to put the ball there, he just wanted to do it.    -He can sort of dress himself, but if anything goes wrong (sock gets twisted while foot goes in shoe, or shirt-sleeve is inside out) he will give up and start complaining and might even cry if things haven't been going well already.  I will show him how to fix it, and assist him in fixing the issue and he goes back to being perfectly fine.  -When we have family staying with us, the kid is ecstatic and gets personalized attention (since I work and my wife has to split her attention).  He goes to a preschool a few morning a week and does fine there.  those days definitely seem to go better as a whole (weekdays when he goes to school vs no-school).  It seems like he can "get his attention fix" much better than at home with just mom and the sisters.  -Very hard to get him to comply with requests: he has never covered his mouth while coughing, despite being asked to every-single-time.  -Can't/won't tell us when he has to go to the bathroom, so he's still in diapers.  Tried potty training, can't get him out of diapers: He CAN hold it for longer now, and if we ask him to go potty, he starts crying, but we put him on there and he'll start peeing in seconds. Tried wearing "big boy" underwear, he peed through all 5 sets in one day.  -hates having his hair cut, going to the dentist, having his ears examined, etc.  -He is finally "okay" with brushing his teeth and likes to do that himself.  -Can't really sit still (I realize this is common for 3 year old boys but it's pretty bad). If we play a "game" to see who can sit on the couch and not move, he will last about 5 seconds, max.  -Is an eating machine.  Gets RIDICULOUSLY excited when it's time to eat.  Jumps up and down and screams with a  big smile on his face. Is always hungry.  Thought this was related to not having enough calories as an orphan, and he may have an eating disorder, time will tell.  -If people are sleeping and you ask him to be quiet, he understands and will be quiet for a minute or so, but inevitably will go back to his loud volume.  Tell him again, he quiets down. Repeat ad nauseum.  -loves to look at books and be read to.  He will fidget and move around the whole time you're reading, but is glad to do it for very long periods.  -He has destroyed god knows how many books. I'm talking broken bindings, ripped pages, etc.  We don't allow him to have "regular" paper books, he has to stick with cardboard books.  He doesn't rip the pages or break the bindings maliciously...in fact, nothing the kid does is malicious, it's like he just. doesn't. get. it.  -Will sit and look through the books by himself for an hour with no problem. just sits there reading.  -likes to dance to music, have piggyback rides, go to playground, etc. likes to watch tv (we only do about 1 hour a day, max on the weekend, and maybe 2 weekdays, so 4 hours of tv per week total)  -he loves his family and can be very sweet and laughs his head off.  We love him!  But the gravy train seems to jump the tracks pretty frequently...but then get right back on.  Sooooo...this boy had some issues to begin with: mental, emotional and physical.  He has been through a LOT: abandonment, culture shock (he was only 19 months), surgery, lots of poking/prodding. I feel bad for him, but he is a damn handful!  We had already adopted some of the ADHD parenting tips without knowing them: not punishing him unless he is outright naughty (which is very rare), not repeating ourselves, asking him to look at us when we need him to hear something, etc.  What's the crowd think about this whole situation.  TL;DR: is my kid ADHD or is it just the universe playing a sick prank on me?

I wanted to know how to go about this. My current doc keeps prescribing the newer meds and I suspect she does this only because the patents on them are haven't lapsed. What's more alarming, though, is that she threatened to stop prescribing different meds to me if this one does not work and rescind her ADHD diagnosis. Though this current med is working--certainly much better than anything before it that she gave me--it has its side-effects and other issues that I would like to try to address with other medication that she obviously pre-empted me from. So......what do I say to the new doc about this? Will the older doc talk to him? Send him her notes and reasoning and telling him that she no longer thinks I have ADHD? Thanks for your help...

1e0a396c9fc93ee28baa16864fb9d683e041aeeb964d016c0d089cc86fbc625a;;;Money management issues - at work Help?;;;A quick bit of background: Not diagnosed with ADHD, highly suspect I have it, appointment scheduled for 4ish weeks from now. Due to job circumstances &amp; a huge increase in responsibilities in the last year, it has been a huge struggle.  A tiny part of my job is managing a large (in my mind, ~$500K) budget, including purchasing hardware, software and services. I get many invoices from many vendors, some of whom are pretty sloppy with the details (double billing, not sending invoices, messing things up royally). I have to sign off on 50+ invoices a month, and I have to scrutinize them in exacting detail. I have to budget and forecast for 1 &amp; 3 years and it all has to be perfect down to the penny.  I constantly miss/forget invoices (they come by mail &amp; email). I miss vendor mistakes and I make my own (paying invoices from the wrong budgets, double paying etc). I can't keep what's been paid and what hasn't straight in my head (and one vendor is _horrible_ for splitting up one order into many, shipping them separately and invoicing separately). I can't do anything consistently so I'm making different mistakes every time, and most times I have to re-figure out how to do everything like it's new. As stuff comes in, I try to keep track of what's been received and what I'm waiting for, but I often lose track, some times we don't get stuff and sometimes I just outright lose stuff.   **Once a month, I'm pretty much reduced to tears trying to pay invoices.**  **Mint.com and pre-authorized payments have really helped me at home, but at work I'm dealing with an issue several orders of magnitude larger.**  Any thoughts? Suggestions? Anyone else dealt with this?  I lay asleep at night worried I'm going to make a million dollar mistake some day.   **[edit] 10 minutes ago, I found out I went over-budget on one item by $3,000. Not a disaster, just another in a year's worth of screw-ups.**
b6da8dc54b9fa62ac30f0f2a7c97b062d7afeb32da70dcfd12fbcaa33eb5016e;;;Never "tested" for ADHD, Diagnosed by my GP and now I'm too far away (college) to visit him for Vyvanse refills. What can I do?;;;My family doctor diagnosed me with ADD and has been writing me prescriptions for Vyvanse for the last 10 months. However, now I'm away for school and in two months I'm gonna run out of meds before I can make a trip back home.   My college's doctors won't write prescriptions without a formal ADD test. I've been told this test is four hours long and requires a week without meds. I'm in honors engineering, I can't afford to miss a day of classes for this test, or to go without meds for a week.  I recently just got tested for narcolepsy, and am awaiting the results. Vyvnase has been helping me manage the sleepiness, so if I am diagnosed with Narcolepsy (or if I qualify for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) I might still be able to get Vvanse through the college doctors with this diagnoses. Otherwise I will have to find an off-campus doctor to get Vyvanse prescriptions from.   So I guess I have a few questions:  **1) Did you get formally "tested" for ADD/ADHD? Or were you just diagnosed by your GP or a psychiatrist? Which one?**  **2) How likely is it that will I be able to find a doctor to write me prescriptions for Vyvanse in my new city just for the school year? Do you think they're going to require this formal test?**   If you've had this problem, or if you have even a minor solution, any help would be appreciated!  **TL;DR:** Is it likely I can go to a new doctor just to get ADD med's refilled, without getting a formal test, if I've been on the medication for 10 months..?  **UPDATE:** My results from the sleep study are that I am officially Narcoleptic. Yay! (I think?). The treatment for narcolepsy is stimulants. I see my GP tomorrow morning, and I might be prescribed a whole new medicine, or I might stay on my Vyvanse. I go back to school in 3 days, and hopefully an official diagnosis of narcolepsy with some sort of ADD/stimulant medicine such as Vyvanse prescribed as treatment will let the University doctors continue to fill my prescriptions when I can't get back to my GP.  It's kinda stupid that the only way I can get my University to treat me for ADD is by treating me for Narcolepsy. *sigh
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Sensory overload in busy new places - tips and tricks?;;;Sorry in advance for a long post, I'm not good at keeping things brief.  I've only recently been diagnosed with ADHD (I'm 23 years old), and a dysthymic disorder that is most likely a direct result of undiagnosed AD(H)D.  Before my diagnosis I'd already booked a lifelong dream trip to Tokyo, for a month. Super psyched about it (still am), but also slightly worried due to the following:  In the summer I was in New York for a month (vacation, on my own) staying with friends of my parents'. At some point I had a complete meltdown: I felt numb, lifeless, like everything was too much and my own brain was driving me completely insane. I just wanted to shut my head down, pause everything, but I couldn't get away from myself.  I wrote this off to all sorts of exterior factors, but have come to realize, or I should say accept, that this was a good example of the 'filter not working' while in an environment full of new input. A sensory overload, so to speak.   While in New York I felt pressured to go out each day, because I would feel weird sitting in someones house all day while being in a fun city. And I won't have this factor in Tokyo as I'm staying on my own. But I'm still slightly worried about experiencing something similar, as I've realized more and more that it's not something you can "think away" or just shrug off.   The thing is, I am starting my medication (methylphenidate) after I return, both because I don't have a big enough time window to get the paperwork in order (and don't want to travel with illegal substance without the right papers), but also because my psychiatrist suggested it might not be a good combo to have to familiarize with new medication while in a foreign country, and have no proper communication with her for a month. There wasn't really a good option here, but the paperwork issue really decided it for us.     So my question is: What do you guys do when you're head is exploding and you just want to pause it (apart from meds)?  Do you have a certain type of meditation that works? Books? Certain teas? Is there something you tell yourself? Or do you have a way of preventing this, for example staying in bed one day (or afternoon) a week?     TLDR; Recently diagnosed, one month trip to Tokyo (alone) soon and starting meds after I get back, afraid of another sensory overload experience, looking for tips &amp; tricks.

I'm going to be taking some intro to Computer Science with the intention of focusing on programming. Computers are the one thing I have more knowledge about than anything else and this feels like my last route to try to make something for my self. I was diagnosed with ADHD in 7th grade and am now after several years all through schooling of being on and off again on all sorts of medicines back to being medicated for this "last ditch" effort at going to school again. Soooo  **TL;DR** -  I've heard some people say that Programming is a good career for others that have ADHD or ADD. (I'm assuming that is for someone with the condition and being treated)  I was wondering why that is?  If anyone of you have ADHD/ADD and are programmers?  How long and hard was it for you to learn?  Do you have tips for someone interested in going to school for programming?  What can I do to get a head start as someone with no prior knowledge on the subject?
d27f04858cc28109e6888fef19845b5af81fe70eb1ea81f2c066ca6e9a28c3fb;;;Need help adjusting to university life.;;;So, I got through A levels with three A's in Chemistry, Physics and Maths. To be honest, physics and maths required little work, and I even got a C for my last physics test yet got high A overall. Chemistry took a lot of work to drag my grades up from a low B to the A I needed, and involved a bunch of retakes along with my last set of tests, but I put in the work, it paid off, and, as well as feeling really proud with myself (chemistry is tough as nuts, an A is an achievement for anyone) I made it into the top University for Mechanical Engineering in the country.  So I thought everything would turn out great: I'd overcome my ADHD at a medication level I was happy with (I no longer felt too messed up when on Ritalin) and overachieved, and made it into a course at a great university where the course was all about the things in physics that I am most interested in, maths (which I would say I am naturally talented at, I always finished my work in class, and was prompted by the Head of Maths to do an AS in further maths, even though it was completely unnecessary), and also electronics (which I have kind of taught myself since year 9, for hobby projects).  However, since arriving, I found it increasingly difficult to turn up to lectures or classes, and within a month was proud if I turned up to one lecture that day. I find it really difficult to get up in the mornings without my mum nagging me (I did buy an alarm clock with powerful vibrator that goes under the pillow and shakes you awake, definitely gets me awake in the morning, but I still can't stay awake), and have found it impossible to get to sleep at night. Even though before I was prescribed melatonin to help me sleep, recently it's been much worse. I've even ended up staying awake all night several times since starting at uni.  It's been really tough to get any work done, which is out of character for me even with the ADHD (considering this is the stuff I read about for **FUN** throughout secondary school) and as such have missed like half of my coursework. Also, I am seriously behind on my maths, where we are supposed to study a module then do a test each week (I  mean, they're getting us to teach *ourselves* maths. Fuck.). So yeah. Since starting in October, I have ended up learning very little, and I hate that I'm fucking up so badly something I was good at in the past.  Lastly, something that has turned into a real bitch, is my inability to eat. It's like, I'm really hungry and my stomach is really shouting at me to eat, but there's this really weird mental block that I just can't put the food into my mouth, and if I did, I couldn't eat it. I think what helped me to eat lunch in the past was the routine, that it was lunchtime and everyone was eating, so it was easier to force down food because it was an idol process, but there isn't a "lunchtime" anymore. Seriously, I could take a stake into a 4 pm lecture and eat it if a wanted.  So, I guess any and all advice would be awesome. It really sucks that I thought I pretty much had ADHD under control, then have it come back with a vengeance. But, I am really struggling with this, and I'm not really sure what to do.

I am almost positive that I have ADHD but I am afraid to go to a doctor and get diagnosed with it because of the cost of the medication. I really want to get my ADHD under control because my grades are suffering greatly but I'm worried about the cost of the medication. I fear that it will cost too much and my parents will not be able to afford it every time I need to refill my medication. What is the general cost of medication, and are there any cheaper forms of medication to keep it under control?  TLDR: What is the general cost of medication, and are there any cheaper forms of medication to keep it under control?

How do I tell her I think I can change her life?;;;My mum had a bit of a crap childhood. It made sense to me that she's an intense person because she felt abandoned by her own parents and experienced some childhood trauma. But, having discovered ADHD myself and seeking a diagnosis, I believe I got it from both her AND my dad. Unfortunately, she's so oblivious to anything (inattentive) that she's never admitted that our family was a bit strange. She has incredibly low self-confidence and fears ending up as a crazy old woman in a dark room watching tv for the rest of her life. Yet, she continues to do nothing about it, instead drinking a bottle of wine by herself several nights a week. I've been seeking help in the past and I opened up to her about it, and she, showing some concern simply said "there's nothing wrong with you". This is because she hasn't grown up in a stable environment with normal people so her perception is skewed. I've ordered Driven To Distraction, so far my idea is to sit her down, no TV on in the background and say "Mum, I think I can change our lives" and talk to her about how I think I have ADHD and how I think she and my brother might too. Does that sound good?

Even back then, most people (the evaluator included) was surprised that I came up as ADHD because I was pretty capable.  Fifteen years later, I'm going to grad school and decide to get on meds. When I went to the school counseling office, the people there clearly didn't believe me, mostly because I'm continuing my education.  I've since switched to a different counseling center and to a counselor that believes me, but even now I still can't shake the feeling that I'm cheating by taking meds. My last evaluation from 8th grade stated that I had no issue finishing problems in the allotted time, and that I often did above average or very well on my tests.  I know there's more to being ADHD than being able to finish a test. I've set up a whole bunch of coping mechanisms for myself and have comorbidity like many experience (anxiety, depression), but what if it's all in my head? What if I'm just too lazy to get my work done by myself? How do you really know?
3390882cbc63aae9ba4c027ac2af35ebd77096f8e51b1dd777b67025764ad0fc;;;Nail biting cessation ;;;I've been a horrible nail biter since I was about three or four years of age. My fingers were disgusting to look at, as I would chew them so short that they would bleed. Throughout my life, I've tried countless times to stop biting them &amp; never had success. Even when I would get acrylics put on, I'd nibble at those.  Anyway, I was diagnosed over the summer &amp; after being put on on Concerta (on Ritalin LA, now), I stopped without trying. I think I was about 3 weeks into my medication when I looked at my fingers &amp; noticed that I hadn't been chewing my nails. The fact that I quit a 28 or 29 year habit (I'm 31) without even trying blows my mind. I mentioned this to my doctor &amp; he said that he had never had a patient mention this; just the opposite. Has anyone else experienced this?
b68b282371c077dfac68be970d71b96430807035d85c161b17f1cd3a4ca1bd15;;;Driving analogy;;;After reading the spoon theory I thought about how could I explain what  it's like for me living with ADHD.  For me, it's like driving an electric car that can only hold a charge long enough for a 10 mile drive without a gas hybrid engine for backup and no GPS navigation system.  I just have some vague directions with things like *at the 3rd lamp post turn left, then look for the tree that seems to be dying and drive about 50 car normal lengths past that onto the 3rd or 4th unpaved road on the right, I forgot which one it was, but a few weeks ago it had road kill right at side of the road, not sure if its still there.*     If I don't remember I have to charge my car before 10 miles are up, my car stops and I can't go anywhere.     Having a low battery light is helpful, like tasks lists are.  But if the light isn't bright enough or there are too many other indicators on my dash lighting up, I might not notice it in time.  It makes me anxious that I am always worried about the battery being charged (forgetting the things I need to do) while trying to look out for the landmarks to get where I need to go.    Eating right, adequate sleep, and exercising feels like it gives me additional batteries to hold a longer charge, but other cars are all gasoline with the ability to fill up anywhere where as i need to plan my route so i can charge when i need it.    Taking meds is like having a GPS system in the car, adding a hybrid engine for greater fuel efficiency and gasoline backup, and a turbocharger.  Normal people don't need to worry about filling up gas every few miles, they just fill up once a week or so and never think about it.   TL;DR it's like I drive a car that can only go 10 miles at a time.

Establish a new, fix up an old, spice up an existing.  ;;;Lots of us have a hard time getting up in the morning, or doing what we need to do in the morning to get out the door in a timely fashion.  #### Let's work on our morning routines this week!  Simple things like:  * Put on all of my clothes (including shoes) before I do my hair, that way I can just pick up and go if I realize I'm running late.    * This one has actually helped me a lot.  Before, I'd spend a lot of time making my hair look right, but I didn't have my shoes on!  Then I'd realize I was running late and I'd still have to do the basics and then I'd miss my train.  * Segregate blocks of time for like activities    * In my bag I have a tablet, a bluetooth keyboard, a sweater, my screwdriver kit, and a pair of headphones.  Before, I'd be running around packing this stuff up while also getting dressed, brushing my teeth, feeding the cat, etc.  Lumping these activities together has saved time and resulted in a more organized morning.  * If you take public transit and have a smart phone or active computer, make it a habit to check the times until the next bus/train comes to your stop.   * This one is dangerous, so be careful.  I've often found myself checking the next train time on my phone only to be sucked into facebook or reddit or the chatroom.  But by checking how much time remains until my next train, I have a keen idea of when I need to be out of the door and what I can still do before I head out.  _Not all of these will apply to everyone of course, but these are just a few that I have found useful for my mornings!_  Share what has worked for you to inspire others, tweak existing routines to be more efficient, come up with brand new things to do if you find yourself with some free time!  If you want, break down your morning from when you wake up until you have to walk out of the door and assign activities to specific blocks of time based on _realistic_ predictions of how long each activity will take.  ### Keep an eye on the clock throughout each morning.  The best way to gain a sense of time, a sense of how long things take, is to look at the clock before and after (and maybe during).

On the reading comprehension test (read a couple of paragraphs, answer a few quetsions). I'm in the 70something (I forget) percentile for words per minute, but the 33rd percentile for reading comprehension.  My psychologist told me that the test results were good, and nothing to worry about. But I'm worrying, obviously. Can someone who understands 'percentile' explain to me what this means?  I read a lot for liesure and this kind of rocked my assumption, but I've been doing a lot of reflection, and it seems that I'm only skimming; I could hardly recall 1/10 of the books I read last year, and of those I'd be hard pressed to tell you what they were about, or who the main character was.  **tl/dr; So... any suggestions for increasing reading comprehension, mostly for liesure reading? And how is your reading comprehension?**  _note: Currently undiagnosed, unmedicated, for the next 4 weeks anyway_

I was diagnosed with adhd, anxiety and depression. Concerta/ritalin definitely has been overall good in terms of school, but i've noticed my anxiety and depressive symptoms seem to be heightening and occurring more often.  I have addressed this with both my psychiatrist and therapist. My psychiatrist thinks i need more CBT. My therapist agrees that my anxiety and depression are worse after starting my meds, but stressed meds help with functionality (which i acknowledge) but that doesn't stop unaddressed issues from still affecting my moods.  I'm not looking for a shortcut. i've come so far from where i was when i initially sought therapy (adhd was not even a consideration at the time), but i don't know whether i should push for switching my adhd med or possible adding an antidepressant or anti-anxiety med or just give it more time.   for what it's worth, i was initially treated for depression with wellbutrin for five months which had no effect. i've been in talk therapy for 1.5 years and on concerta for one year.

I had always gotten by with A-/B+ grades by procrastinating a lot and leaving everything for a couple all nighters. I barely studied for tests and didn't read the books we were supposed to and was known as the kid who never really did his work but still did pretty well.   However, during second semester I had a lot of other personal things going on and ended up going to see a psychiatrist who pretty quickly diagnosed me with ADD and started me on vyvanse. It made a huge difference and I was able to pick up my grades which had fallen to mostly B+/B-'s.   Since then I've taken medication off and on, partly because of the side effects, but mostly because I still feel like I'm cheating somehow by taking medication. I know I can get by without medication, but I get so much less out of school when I do and it's so much more stressful. I feel weird about the idea of taking a pill nearly every day for the rest of my life to function properly and I can't seem to stop thinking the braver route is to move on without medication.   How does /r/adhd feel about this? Are there any personal experiences/things to read or watch that you think would be helpful and might clear this up for me?

I am beyond standard "therapists" these days. I already know the cognitive behavioral issues that stand in my way. I have worked through my "mommy issues" and all that crap in past years. The last time I tried a therapist I told her all I have done and frankly, after two sessions she had no other suggestions.  So now I turn to the topic of **ADHD Coaching** which is a varied and wild world. I have tried an ADHD coach, and for the first month this person was fairly useful. The issue is that my coach has first-hand experience with ADHD, as they had it themselves.   This caused issues for me, because we would agree on the coach reaching out to me for "accountability" things, and well, for the first three days it worked. Then we both fell into our usual habits of "forgetting". My coach also rambled and switched topics a lot, so we were in essence, floating along the ADHD spectrum trying to stay on topic and find focus but not really getting there in our weekly discussions.  I will say I did learn **a lot** from this person, and I feel that they prodded me forward to change several key behaviors that I had, and those changes are still holding strong, which is wonderful. But once I got through those major issues, I am feeling like the 'finessing' of my concerns and issues are falling by the wayside. So, I have asked to discontinue services from this person, and either it's true ADHD, or they really don't care, I haven't heard from them one way or the other. I presume I won't get a Paypal bill in 3 weeks and if I do, I will burn their phone lines up complaining that we haven't talked in that much time.  So my question is this: What types of ADHD coaching are out there? Are there people who aren't ADHD providing coaching? The folks who **do have** ADHD are good at intuitively understanding my needs, but then the general characteristics of our disorder make it tough to really get what I need from them.  Does anyone else have an ADHD coach who really works for them? What's that relationship like? What do you learn from them? Do they also have ADHD?  The things that make us empathetic to each other are also the things that prevent us from structuring and following a plan for improvements. It's truly the blind leading the blind in this world, as far as peer coaching from other coaches who have ADHD is concerned. I need someone who will truly hold me accountable, help me change my behaviors, and help me understand what I want - as everything distracts me and it all seems interesting until I really get into it.  Thanks for any advice or thoughts you can provide, netizens of /r/ADHD....

dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Instead of being a disability, I think of ADHD more as a different way of learning and a different way of seeing the world.;;;It's not so much that I think of it as a gift, as I think of it as a different way of thinking.    Approximately 5% of the world's population has ADHD.  While that is a large number (a *huge* number in fact), it is still only 1/20th of the world's population.  The rest of the world (the 19/20ths of the population) learn in a totally different way than us.  What does that mean exactly?  It means that they expect us to learn the same way that they do.  The thing is, we don't learn that same way.  We learn in our own way; the way our brains were hardwired.  I hate that people without ADHD think that we are stupid and lazy.  We aren't, we just *think differently*.  Why don't they get that?  I cannot say.  What I do know is that we cannot think of ourselves as being stupid *or* lazy.  Guys, we are *smart*!  Don't feel bad about yourself, because they have no right to put you down.  Teachers, parents, bosses, friends... they just have a different way of thinking than you.  Meds are good because they allow you to function in this hostile environment that we live in, same with therapy, but don't think that you *have* to use them.  I recommend medication, very highly in fact, but don't be afraid to *embrace* your ADHD.    **TL;DR** : Don't feel like you are stupid, lazy, or disabled because you have ADHD.  ADHD is a different way of learning and a different way of seeing the world.  Don't let those jerks who call you stupid, annoying, or lazy get you down!

Diagnosed as an adult, reading this may help if similar.;;;I have seen this on occasion, and perhaps more often since I have paid more attention over the past week.  I am prescribed IR Adderall, and I took my dosage (30mg) around noon (I take one in AM also but woke up late, so skipped it).  Around 5pm, I saw my monitors look something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/4CurbbG.png).   Yeah, meds are wearing off for sure...noticed a loss 15 minutes earlier maybe, but that much open is a sign for us all, of course.  **At this point, I'm still wanting to be productive, but now my mind is racing even more than when not medicated (or on, mind races a bit on meds but I can control much better) but the hyperactivity, at least physically, was manifesting itself.**  I'd curse and stomp if (minor) things like my computer freezing occured.  I'd get fidgety while sitting down.  When typing, I would make typos because it almost felt like I lost full control of my extremities in random bursts.  I was diagnosed as an inattentive type, however--so maybe this is a form of the inattentiveness manifesting itself as a hyperactive symptom?  I say this because after my introspection and such, I became comfortable with my diagnosis (at age 20, 6+ years ago) because I was a quiet hyperactive as a kid--that is, hyperactivity led to consequences so negative (few friends, verbally and at times physically abusive parents) that it manifested as inattentive.  I know this is a common thing with adults that struggle with their (late) diagnosis, so wanted to point a couple personal examples like that out.  There are other hyperactive things I likely was doing before I took my afternoon dosage around 6pm, which helped kinda...but it's half the AM/noon dose because I like falling asleep easily.    I will ask my doc about this when I see him next month, **but is this the same with anyone else?**  I was curious if there is a correlation either through anecdotes or a study if someone can find such a thing for me to look at.  Also, **can lowering dosage alleviate this?**  My dosage (75mg--30-30-15 at am-noon-afternoon respectively) **is quite high** but lowering it will take time to get used to, as I have been at this dosage for 6+ months.  **TL;DR--I am a diagnosed inattentive that gets hyperactive on occasion when meds wear off, perhaps even when on meds.  How can I stop this?  Is this common--hyperactives becoming inattentives or vice versa?**

She has majorly struggled in school and just recently started homeschooling (I am her homeschool tutor and I have ADD as well so we make a great pair haha). She is super behind, she barely knows how to read(we're working on that), she can't get any work done on her own. She gets really overwhelmed really easily and is crying at least once a week, and throwing hissy fits nearly every day. She is also physically handicapped from Polio, and she seems really depressed.  She has had some horrible teachers and my parents just want to sweep her problems under the rug. They've tried to get her treated in the past but there were a lot of problems with it and they just can't afford it. She has been ignored and treated like the bad kid her whole life. She is so beat down. I tell her that she is not stupid and that she is good at other things, but it doesn't seem to be enough.   What can I say to her? I'm thinking of maybe writing her a special letter or something. Really, I'd do anything to help her. I'd even try to pay for her treatment myself if that is the only option.

I started taking Adderall XR 20mg, but it didn't have the effects/benefits I was hoping for.  I was still struggling to understand and cope with my ADHD.   A couple of years later I found out Adderall and my birth control weren't agreeing with my liver. To top off the liver problems, I discovered that I have Hashimoto's disease.    I was advised by my doctor to consider diet changes such as going gluten free. However unless someone told me I had to, it wasn't going to happen... Well had an allergic reaction to something, which cause my boyfriend (now husband) to push me for a food allergy test...   TADA! Gluten and casein were on my list. Now I realize that those blood tests aren't the gospel but they certainly do raise red flags.  So I went the course of cutting out gluten and casein from my diet to see what would happen.  I have to say I've experienced MAJOR improvements! My focus and thought process is clearer. I'm able to work through the noise better than I ever did on Adderall.  I won't say that I'm perfect. I still have fluxes in energy levels, but I don't get sleepy like before. It is easier to maintain more consistent levels in everything, which is the key for me to be able to manage my ADHD. Seriously I feel great!   So I'm curious if anyone else has tried changing their diet. It hasn't been easy to be true to (damn you, McDonald chicken nuggets), but the benefits for me have outweighed the desire to cheat.   TLDR: Going gluten and casein free has improved ability to combat ADHD symptoms

3a952d8232f2a3fc4a18803975b926be26fc18641459201e1edfac8b28de17a9;;;Living with my ADD/ADHD boyfriend is killing me.  ;;;I love him dearly, I wouldn't have stayed this long if I didn't think he was a truly wonderful human being.  But our relationship is killing me, literally.  When he first moved in with me, I understood that he had to move across the country, giving up his (part-time) job that he'd had for 3 years.  He lived with his ill father then, so I thought the part-time, no car, no home of his own was just the result of taking care of his dad - after all, I took care of a parent and understood the challenges (although I managed to also keep a job, a car and a house).  Fast foward five years and the longest he's managed to keep a part-time job is 7 months.  He's been fired from 5 jobs - after 2 days, 3 weeks, 2 months, 3 months, and 7 months.  At one point, he spent the better part of a year sitting at home smoking and playing video games, all while telling me he was working on his book.  Well, yes, he was working on a book (the same one he'd been working on for years), but I was struggling to go to school, work a job, and come home to take care of EVERYTHING - dishes, laundry, shopping, you name it.   We've talked and talked and talked and fought and fought and fought.  Each time I've been persuaded that things will get better, and they do, for a while.  But then something important gets overlooked, or I come home from a 17 hour day of work to find he's been on reddit all day, or the door was left open and the cat got out, or that the only thing accomplished in the last 17 hours was making a pile of dirty dishes, etc, and I lose it.  I'm physically and emotionally spent.  I'm working two jobs to keep a roof over our head, taking care of my mom, trying to fix up our house, and feel like I'm raising an adult child.  I have blinding chronic headaches, chest pain, back spasms, frequent colds, severe depression,  you name it.  I've pointed out that his self-medicating is not helping his ADD, but he doesn't believe it (because for him, it FEELS like it helps).  I ask a question and get no response and he wonders why it pisses me off?   Nobody like to be ignored.  I went from being sad and lonely to being angry and bitter.  The problem is, kicking him out won't actually fix things - it's not like he's just lazy and needs a kick in the butt.  He's ADD and needs help that he refuses to get.  I don't know what to do, but as I feel a migraine forming, I wonder how much longer I can survive this.  Anyone who's been the partner of an ADD/ADHD person have any advice they can offer?  I would like to work things out rather than end them... uPDATE 1: I just watched a link to the Russell Barkley video. It doesn't change how completely overwhelmed I am, but it does give me a bit of hope, namely because I can now see that my boyfriend is trying. He sucks at it, but he is trying in his own consistently inconsistent way (Like today I reminded him that it is frustrating when I'm talking to him and he's completely non-responsive, so he's made an effort all day to acknowledge that he's listening. He'll forget tomorrow, but that he tried today says something, right? ) So maybe there really is hope if we can find the right help...
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Finally going to post my issues: I pick at self, and I think I have constant anxiety as well. Is this possible?;;;One of my symptoms to lead me to getting diagnosed, treatment, and medication (currently on generic adderall) is that I constantly am picking at myself. Yes, this sounds like I am sort of meth head (trust me I did this before ever doing adderall so its not the drugs).  It all started with chewing my nails. Fairly normal habit to have, especially at a young age. Do it cause of nervousness Ive always been told and in my head im thinking... But im not nervous right now? And still, I have never stopped.  Since then I have found that I chew cuticles, pick skin (especially scabs+zits if they are there), chew on inside of my lip, at one point I counted my teeth with my tongue over and over again (yes, I got the same amount every time...), and a few years ago I developed the worst thing yet. I yank out my eye brows. Started out slow, filled in a couple gaps when I did too much and for a couple years now I basicically draw on my brows... This is really hard to talk about because I am so insecure about them.  But basically, with a little more info than just my constant picking, I went and got tested and got medication. Things have improved, but the picking not necessarilly. At least it hasnt gotten worse.  Then I tried really really hard to pay attention to when and why I would pick. And honestly, its all the fucking time. And im starting to wonder if maybe I dont have as much ADHD issues, as anxiety issues. I have grown up being a very busy and involved child. I do have my breaks, so its not that I just need to "slow down". Even on vacations/breaks I do this. And right now, I have school and a job and am in a play, but I have some nice hours to myself quite a few times a week and yet I never stop the picking. And if I somehow tell myself to NOT FUCKING touch my brows, I will go to my nails. Then my cheeks, etc.    Anyway, is the picking a form of anxiety? Im afraid to ask my doctor for both but I dont know about giving up my adderall precription yet either, cause it helps too.  Thanks for reading this far.  **TL;DR: I constantly pick at myself and absolutely cant stop. Pretty sure I have constant anxiety but I also think I have ADHD. What the hell do I do??**

After failed attempts of trying to cure depression or cope with nonexistent Asperger's I have a concrete enemy I can fight against. Except the diagnosis was long, and ate all me money - and for the next few months I won't have the needed cash for therapy. Don't want to use medication for now.  I'm in desperate need of methods how to cope with loss of concentration. I'm talking about the case (dunno if it's common) where you're trying to focus on something, and it sort of slips away from your grasp. And all energy you put into it gets wasted, only makes you more tired and irritated that you can't do a simple task. The problems it generates for me are huuge.  So, are there any methods you'd recommend? Books to read? Or won't I be able to tackle this problem unless I take meds?  TL;DR: I can't cope with loss of concentration and it's destroying me.

Is that still working for you?;;;A few weeks ago, some fellows here started trying moving to stand-up desks and apparently for a lot of them it was working.  Someone said that it might just be a thing from the novelty of it, and we all know that that's true, we get really stimulated by new things.  So now that time has passed, how is that working for you guys, do you think is it worth it to modify a desk to work standing? How do you deal with standing all the time?  Thanks!

On which they will judge if they should test me or not. I'm so scared at the moment, that they won't be able to help me. There's questions popping in my head like: "What if I don't have ADHD, what if I'm really just lazy, where do I go from here"  It's not like I want to be diagnosed with ADHD, I just want help for my problems. My life is a total mess, I have so many great ideas, but I can't seem to start on these projects. Everything I start never gets finished, even though I start enthusiastically, it always ends in failure. My friends don't even listen to me anymore when I got this great idea, because they already know I won't do it anymore. I can't even finish a video game. I spend to much money on things I don't need. My paperwork is a mess. My school is a mess, I missed all exams because I was too scared to go. When I started learning I got these panic attacks, and couldn't concentrate at all. It was like I was reading but nothing went through me. My house is a mess. Dishes almost never get cleaned. I can barely get myself to feed my cat (but I do). I always forget so many things, where I put my keys and such. I can't concentrate on much, if watching a movie I get distracted. When I'm enthusiastic about something, I'm unable to sit still. I go to bed late, feeling really tired all day.  And it's not that I'm depressed, I know that I'm not depressed. I've being this way all my life.  I'm sorry if this text doesn't make much sense. So what my question actually is.  If I don't have ADHD, can the Psychiatrist help me get my life back on track? And If I do can they also help me?  Is it too late for me to start chasing my dreams, and become what I wanna become? I'm 22 at the moment.  EDIT: Thanks for all the answer guys, the appointment is just a few hours away!

I have severe back/body pain issues, i am 25 years now, and been coping with these pain for 10 years.  Besides pain through my whole body i have some severe concentration issues. I can not concentrate on pretty much anything unless i like it very very much. Writing long stories like this is difficult as I think many can relate.  Last december i went to some big tests and got diagnosed ADD. Finally some things fell on their place.  After medication (methylfenidate) i felt i could acceive so much more and my emotions where more in controll and i am so much happier.  I had some extra motivation because of this and decided it is time for change.  I started with simple walking, 2,85km i came home and was complety broken. My back hurt alot and i was tired as hell. But i kept pushing myself everyday.  I stopped eating fat/ sweet food and drinking alcohol. And starting to eat more healthier.  Somehow last month i started to trust myself more an more and saw my own potential which i havent seen in 10years.  I can now walk easily 8km and run 3,5km. The pain in my body went from a 9/10 to a 4/10. And lost almost 8kilo.  I will continue and i will not lose.   I wanted to share this story as i am recently new to ADD and writing this will also help me.   TL;DR: recently ADD diagnosed, got medicine which helped me excersise and gain more controll over my body and life.
e9659dfc5fc2c437ef7fefb651d3f2bb3043c496f344b9f92c80cba69f766e61;;;ADHD Inattentive: What is Common?;;;Heya everybody.   A couple years ago I was diagnosed with ADHD. I believe it to be the Inattentive type. During school I procrastinated hard, wouldn't remember what happened in class, and would get B's or worse after Junior High (Last year of Junior High I was honor roll 3/4 terms). I assumed it was because I got a computer and decided it was way more fun/important. I also loved to Daydream, live in my own fantasy world for a while. That died down around my mid 20's. I kind of miss it.  As I got older, though, I found I was still circling things, lot of dreams... not a lot of follow through. And it always seemed like I lived in a semi fog, that I couldn't remember what happened day to day (I read about Slow Cognitive Tempo, but that's very extreme for my issues I feel). My college tries were B's or F's. "I'll do that homework later. Okay, I didn't do it this week.. but I'll really hit it hard next week." Doing anything that took sustained mental work was hard as hell for me (Can't stand most puzzle games like Scrabble or Bejeweled). Even the things I enjoyed doing was hard, like it was breaking through a wall. My memory was and is atrocious most days. My father would tell me to get him something, and I'd forget. Sometimes I'd remember walking towards the house, other times when I saw him, and then other times.. not at all. Things seemed to happen around me and I don't remember them much on my own.  At 29 I found out I had ADHD after my wife was diagnosed as combined type and well, a lot of her issues seemed really familiar. I went on Adderall and it was a huge difference. My memory, focus and drive was very good. For awhile. Now, it feels like it barely does a dent. As I was reading up on ADHD-I I read that Strattera seems better for ADHD-I than stimulants, and most use a combination. I also feel like the stimulants destroy my random sense of humor, and I become far more serious to a point that it worked for work.. but I didn't really like it for the normal me. Also made me a bit more alpha, which was okay. I am far too okay being stepped on normally.  My question is, does anyone else have any advice on this type of ADHD? If my situation and experiences seems on the mark or not? I have an appointment with a new Psychiatrist tomorrow.  TL;DR: Talking about my experiences with ADHD-I, and looking for feedback/stories/shared experiences/advice with medications.

My supervisor said she had to meet with the senior team to see about the termination of my position and that in the meantime I had to do a few things. That was at 9am. It is now 1pm. I am still waiting. I am working on my grad school application (nothing like the fear of unemployment to get me to finish my application) and I feel like I am in hell.  I went on vacation this week and simply forgot to tell ANYONE that I would be gone the whole week. I seriously forgot. I mentioned i would be gone monday and tuesday but FORGOT ABOUT THE REST OF THE WEEK.  Now you may ask yourself how could I have forgotten such an important task. I have been asking myself that same question and I JUST DON'T KNOW. 3 missed workdays are a good reason for termination. I am about to get fired from a job I love.  I don't know what i did, i don't know what to do. I even thought how great it would've been to get in a car accident as I was driving to the office this morning. I am fucked.  EDIT: The HR person is not in the office today so they told me that we would talk tomorrow and figure out what needed to happen then. I almost wish I would've been fired, now I get to go home and wonder whether i will get fired tomorrow or now.

Thank you /r/adhd, you guys have made all the difference, thank you.;;;Starting from over one month ago, I found out about adhd, learned about the symptoms, everything clicked, my childhood makes sense, my present, and my future all make sense.  With the realization that I have adhd, I told my parents. This is a road that i was met with doubt, and anger from my dad. He claimed that i am simply lazy, and need to try harder than to find something to blame for my performance. This soon turned into my dad in denial, and started to say just deal with it, and ranted about medications for a while. He took no effort in helping me find a psychiatrist to evaluate, he instead found reasons to blame me for the adhd symptoms, and that i took no intiative in order to "fix" the adhd.  This is where the subreddit helps the most, having no other outlet or intake of information, i found first hand information and knowledge about the adhd ,and its treatment options. Without /r/adhd I don't think I would be where I am right now.  Anyways, with continued posts, comments and browsing i was able to keep trying to find a way to get diagnosed with my parents approval.   I called so many places, so many resource desks and various psychiatrists, they were either full or cannot take me because i have no insurance, so after about 30 calls i was finally able to find a doctor who would take me in.   After 1 week of making the appointment, I went in, talked to the doctor about my symptoms, dangers, behavior, and school performance. Despite me being very anxious i have to say it went very well and I was on my way with a concerta 18mg prescription in about 45 minutes.   Thank you so much, reddit for helping me through this process!   (for those who are wondering i deleted my other ADHD_Confucious account and made this one)

My doctor prescribed me 10mg Adderall XR and suggested I try taking one at first, and two if need be.  Now I've been taking one 10mg in the morning, and the second in the afternoon because I feel that works best.  However, my doctor told me that adderall is designed to be taken once a day and suggested I take 2 x 10mg at once.  Is this something of concern?  Does spacing out the dosage even make a difference?  I feel uncomfortable that taking such a large dosage (for my body size) may have unforeseeable consequences and I rather remain in control by spacing out my dosage.  Thanks in advance -- I've been a longtime lurker in this community and just wanted to chime in on how supportive this sub is.

[Kick-Start Monday] and Kick Your To-Do List's Butt!;;;First of all, let me apologize profusely for forgetting to post this yesterday. I guess I know what my first high priority item should be.  ***  Kick-Start Sunday is where /r/adhd shares the goals, tasks, or habits we want to accomplish this week.  You will be held gently accountable (which is a good thing!) and we can check in with you...helping YOU get things done.  *I suggest you read the whole post to be MORE successful, so put in the little extra initial effort and continue reading....*  *** ## Choose the participation method that works for you: * **Most important task** - Share one (or a couple) **HIGH-PRIORITY** tasks that you really would like to finally finish.  *(Ex. Set a doctors appointment, finish assignment, clean the kitchen...whatever YOU think is most important.)* * **Make a list** - Post a list of all the things you want to accomplish this week.  *(I highly recommend identifying the top 3 priorities.)* * **Feed your soul** - Sometimes by relaxing and having fun we have more energy to get more done. **List a couple FUN items to make your list more exciting.**  **Need/Want to copy last week's list *verbatim*?  Absolutely DO SO!**  *Those might be your keystone habits. Once you start doing those regularly you are able to do more. soon they will be automatic and you can put your focus elsewhere.*  *** By sharing our goal(s) with this understanding community, we can keep each other **accountable**...and **celebrate our successes**, large or small!  **Don’t forget to return for [Win Wedenesday] to flaunt your successes!**  ;-)  By getting one small task done it creates **momentum**, **trust** in yourself, **confidence**, and you will feel like doing more.  *** ## Suggested Guidelines * **Prioritize your list.** One thing you want to get done (or start). What is the most important thing for you? (If making a list works best for you feel free to do that too!) * **Add a finish OR start deadline.** By committing to a date/time, we can check on your progress. * **Edit your comment when done.** - Come back and edit your comment when you have finished your goal. We can celebrate that (and then people won't check on you). * **Small start.** - Share what SMALL (under 10 minutes) commitment you can make towards your goal.  *I found when my clients didn’t reach their goals 90% of the time they never started...this will help you break through the initial barrier.*  *** ## Tips * Your tasks/goals should ideally be S.M.A.R.T goals: **Specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound** * **Measurable** - Make sure you can be able to say YES I DID THIS. **Study enough** is not measurable.  Study 2 hours is. * **Break it down** - Instead of saying clean my room...it might help to say, “Clean room for 10 minutes or pick up trash in room.” * **Write it down elsewhere** - Sticky note by computer.  Google calendar.  Agenda.  Write it down so you don't forget.  Our working memories are flaky.... * **Start small...build up slowly** - We want to build on small successes so committing to cleaning your entire house might be a bit too much to handle.  Pick a room (or a task like ‘pick up dirty laundry’)  instead. * **Want to study for 2 hours a day?** *Commit to studying 30 minutes to make it easier on you.*  *** ## Examples from previous weeks: * Tidy room. * Buy car. * Go to work. * Attend all my classes on time. * Reschedule appointment. * Mornings: brush teeth &amp; meditate.  Evenings: brush teeth, meditate, journal. * Pay bills. * Plan vacation. * Go to the gym 3x this week. * Break down chores by days so I can have 'a day off with my darling' before he leaves. * **Start** *[something]*. “Spend 5 minutes on writing my paper.”  *** ## *It’s now easier to respond!  Just copy/paste the below into your comment.*      ## Daily Habit / Procrastinated Project / Soul-Feeding     * **What?** -     * **How much time?** -     * **When?** -     * **Potential Obstacles?** -     * **Check in on me? When?** -     * **Small Start** -     * **Reward** -     * **Something fun you want to do this week** -     * **Daily Habit** -  *** Daily list template, if that suits you better.      ## Monday --       * Item     ## Tuesday --     ## Wednesday --     ## Thursday --     ## Friday --     ## Saturday --       ## Sunday --  *** Don’t forget to **brag about your accomplishments in Win Wednesday** on Wednesday.  **Celebrating/acknowledging your wins is just as important as actually getting stuff done.**  *** **TL,DR: Share what you want to accomplish this week and how you will do it. Having people check on you via Reddit is extremely helpful!**

I don't think I've seen a single down vote towards someone who is posting about their troubles or mini-victories.  With that said, I think it also needs to be said that there is a bit of a sampling error here. I was fortunate enough to have been diagnosed a very young age, and as a result, I have been taking medicine for a long enough time to the point where I don't recognize myself as ADD on a regular basis. I know a lot of people who are ADHD and have known for a while who feel the same.  And because of that, we don’t generally look for answers online too often.  We generally know what the problem is already.  I actually found this Subreddit as a fluke.  However, I know a lot of people come here because they are looking for an answer.  And as a result, there are many posts here about how people have fairly recently "discovered their problem" or "have finally been prescribed medication". But this is dangerous.   If troubled people come here and see a high concentration of people who swear by medication, they think it’s the only answer.  Extremely heavy narcotics should never be the first resort.  Please, if this is your first time hearing about ADHD or first time thinking you might have it, don't think the only answer is in pill form.  While it may seem popular here, it may not be the only answer.  It truly breaks my heart to see a post saying "I think I have ADHD, and I'm going in tomorrow to my psychiatrist to ask for medication." Trust me, there are many other highly functional ADD people in the world who have learned to cope without medication.  Don’t get me wrong, medication is a perfectly viable option, and it works for many people including myself, but I really wish someone would have help me differently. *tl;dr:* **You aren’t broken.  There isn’t a thing about you that is wrong.  You don’t need to be fixed.  Society is designed for a certain type of person.  Everyone outside of those bounds is just different.  That’s who we are. Medication is a way to cope for those differences, not to make us “normal”.  Our brains aren’t designed for these drugs, rather these drugs are designed to make our brains fit in society.  The problem isn’t that you don’t work, it’s that society only has one option.  Find the other option.**

He thought I had add and prescribed me ritalin 5mg. But I don't know what's the deal with doctors here he just wanted to get the appointment over quickly and I was diagonised within 10 minutes. WTF? Anyway, I wanted to ask him about physical symptoms of add but I forgot + he was in a hurry. Now I want help from you guys. I feel like every muscle in my body is troubling me. Like I need to twist my hand leg and keep feeling extreme discomfort in other parts of body. I feel like poking my eyes out and hitting my rib with a hammer. It' not physical exactly but I feel the need to move my hands  and feet and eyes and stomach and everything. It is soo frustrating. Is this anyway related to ADD? if not what could it be?

When I was younger I was diagnosed with ADHD, I was prescribed 40mgs of ritalin (from 1 dose to 3 doses daily before meals if memory serves me correctly). This was between the ages of 10-15, at which point I asked to stop taking the medication as I felt like there was no point too taking it. At that point, my grades toke a dive into the ground and my parents (for what ever reason) did not make the connection. Hell, I didnt even make the connection until writing this now.  I always realized that I may have ADHD and it was affecting me to some degree, I never really fully accepted that it was a bigger apart of my life until after college and until after me and my SO bought two amazing kittens. They brought so much needed focus to my life... something to play with and love that I was able to start thinking about myself a little more... then I discovered this subreddit.  Everything that is described by others in these forums fits my life exactly. It isnt until now I realize that EVERYTHING That makes me ME, every quarkiness, every little thing that I do... my randomness that people at work accept because its who I am... is all one big lie.  And why do I call it a lie? Because If I were to go on medication I feel as if everything I have been through all these years will disappear. I have worked REALLY HARD at maintaining myself through a multitude a methods WITHOUT medication... but it is only now I realize that I simply can not go further with my life without taking something.  You may call it fear... fear that I may change the very facet of how I am if I were to take medication... but to me I feel like I have defined myself SO MUCH on the basis of AHDH, I have to try to reinvent myself... I simply dont want to do that... maybe I fear that Ill become something I dont want to be... and its more likely that I am just over thinking it all.  I dont know what I am seeking with typing this out, but I always imagined that if I were to really have ADHD... that I had full out right control of it... and when it came a time when I tried forcing myself not to act out... when I forced myself not to be quarky or tried to just get up to do dishes only to have a massive pain in my brain...  gawd. I feel hopelessly not in control of myself. For the first time I feel as if I am not the captain of my ship. -_-
7616bdb869c3bf1eedb604d403559b839ce03c3a6cdecd2489a9805fb04f6f9f;;;...the results are in.;;;I met with my physician today and it turns out as I suspected I do in fact have ADD. To be specific it was the ADD combined. I am relieved and ready to start the rest of this process and get myself to the place I need to be. I am starting out with a 50mg Vyvanse script that I start tomorrow morning.   I do have a bit of a gripe with the general attitude toward ADD. I went to the pharmacy to get the script filled and they said since I was over 18 my insurance company has blocked it! I know have to get a preauthorization form approved by the insurance company in order to cover it. Luckily, I have a bit of spare cash in the bank account so I filled my script out of pocket ($200.53) but when the authorization comes in I will get a refund down to whatever the insured amount is. Needless to say, I am all but a little bit pissed at my insurance company. What does it matter if I am over or under 18 years old? It has nothing to do with anything other than age, and if I was 17 years old I would have been covered. Why do they pretend this isn't real? How can that be ethically right? Has anyone ever taken any action against the discrimination (this is discrimination) that they are blatantly engaging in? /Rant  Either way, I am excited yet nervous to start my treatment tomorrow and I am hopeful that I am able to notice the effects. I have already made a mini agenda of things I really want to get done tomorrow so hopefully I can accomplish most of my list and judge the effects of the meds.   TL;DR- Met with the Dr. today and was diagnosed with ADHD-C. Insurance companies suck. Start Vyvance 50mg in the morning. Nervous and excited.
09937afabfad14ef8c7c1fb12f66974af68935131b2b248716caff99a9aaa980;;;After spending months on testing, assessments and appointments finally saw a psychiatrist and he thinks I have depression, not ADHD;;;Warning, wall of text:  About three months ago I read a post on reddit where someone talked about how their ADHD medication helped them resolve a list of issues. I'd never read about ADHD and had a pretty typical "most people are faking for meds" attitude and didn't have any understanding of the disorder aside from some vague notion that it made kids hyper. When I read that post, it was like reading a diary entry I'd wrote and forgotten. I was floored.   I started searching for symptom lists, took iffy internet quizzes and started to really think there might be something to it. I read the first few pages of "Drive to Distraction" and bought it a few days later (I still haven't finished it yet...). Reading it was haunting. Out of the self assessment questions in the book there were only two that didn't jive with me or my situation. I knew I needed to have a professional assess me. I called to schedule an appointment with my GP, but Kaiser has a mental health branch so I was directed to call them instead. I made an appointment for the soonest opening they had (a month out) and waited.  When my appointment finally came, I saw a therapist who asked me questions and took notes. She gave me some family/parents/coworker assessment forms and told me to return to take some standard scantron bubble test with 500+ questions and a attention test you take by hitting a spacebar when specific letters do or don't show up. I returned a week later to take the test and turned in the assessments. The assessments (to my untrained eye) appeared to make a pretty good case for ADHD, but I was told the scantron test was the most valuable diagnostic tool.  I waited two more weeks for the results to make it to a psychiatrist (not someone I've seen or will ever see, they could be anywhere on the planet for all I know) and another week for the letter to come back that said: "Your results suggest that although other issues may be present as well, there do seem to be features of ADHD. If you would like treatment, please call..."  I thought, "Okay, let's find out what the treatment is. I'd love to be able to start, finish or focus like a normal person." I get an appointment for a week after I got the letter.  I went to the appointment and the psychiatrist asks me why I'm there. I've never been to a psychiatrist before, so I figure it's just a way to get me talking about my problems. So I start talking about not being able to focus at work, being distracted really easily, about getting distracted in the middle of a conversation and he starts interrupting me, asking if I feel sad, if I ever cry etc. I'm thinking at this point "Okay...". He then starts asking me if I ever feel depressed and I answer honestly, that yes, in the last 2-3 months every few weeks there's been a day of depression caused by some major stress in my life but overall I'm a happy person. He then asks me if I'm ever bored or if anything holds me interest and I tell him that no, I'm actually *too* good at being entertained. Then he asks me if I get mood swings and I answer, "No." After that he asked me if I was irritable and I replied "Only when I'm interrupted, and just for a moment. It quickly goes away."  After the very weird questions, he says that he's going to prescribe me an anit-depressant. I'm pretty bewildered so I ask him why and he said it was to help me with my mood swings and irritability. I started arguing with him telling him that I'm not depressed, struggling to figure out where he got that from what I said. He then asks me, "Why are you here?" And I tell him because I think I have ADHD. He then tells me that no, I don't have ADHD and that that I read the letter wrong. It doesn't mean I have symptoms of ADHD, it means I have attention issues that are caused by depression. I asked him, "So I've been depressed my whole life?" He started going on about the scantron test and how it was analyzed so I asked him about the assessment sheets I was given (Utah criteria) and he said "Everyone is going to think they have ADHD from reading that."  After all of that, he gives me a prescription for my depression and I ask him "So that's it, I just take the medication?" "Yes, we'll see if you've responded in 6 weeks." The entire time I'm talking to a psychiatrist about how he thinks I'm depressed and there's not one attempt to talk to me through it or give me some guidance on how to deal with depression. Just a prescription for Bupropion.  Is my experience normal?

A woman asked me "so tell me why you called" and I said "well I think I might have ADD or ADHD, but I'm not sure because I don't know what is and isn't normal behavior."  She said "we can offer study skills coaching but we don't do diagnostics or prescriptions with that sort of thing."  I said "why, because of kids showing fake symptoms?"  She said 'yeah they sell their medications and that sort of thing.'   I'm at a top 100 secular American college.  This is so weird.  I'm really scared because I think I'm gonna flunk out of college if I don't get this fixed.  Already looking at community colleges back home.    When you go to a diagnostic session, are they supposed to ask YOU questions?  Or is it a "present your case" thing?  Should I prep?    I don't know what to do..  It's not like a physical thing where you go "my arm hurts."  I've never done a mental health type thing before :(
83341726c41afe4937f1633140f7b5c877ae602f703783f4ae3d6821bc1354b7;;;New relationships/dating?;;;Ok, so last Friday I met a guy (I've known him for half a year, but I haven't seen him in that time), we were drunk, and I slept over. We only kissed, we were too drunk -luckily-. I've wanted to kiss him for that half year, and finally I did it.  And I should realize it didn't mean anything, we were drunk, had fun, but it was only for once for him.  But Jesus Christ, I'm really obsessing over that guy. Thinking about him, wanting him to send me a message, all that stuff. I don't even know if I like the guy. He's nice and good looking, but maybe not really my type?  It just feels like a distraction from my schoolwork, which I have to sort out on my own for this week and the beginning of next week, so I'd rather do something else.. like obsessing over the guy. And I hate it, why can't I be normal and just 'see what happens'?  And because I'm like this I'm afraid to go to events he will be at as well.  Maybe anyone else experiencing the same thing? Or any advice how to get back to my schoolwork, and not checking Facebook all the damn time?  I'm sorry this is just a stupid story and not something contributing to the community, but I have to get this off my chest.  Cheers!  Edit: and oh yeah, I feel like he doesn't talk to me because I'm stupid/ugly/whatever. I know this is an anxiety and I'm gonna get treatment for it, but I want some tips how I can ease 'the pain'.
d9c1353909d44300b49c0811195fce7f3a90fa46d3a85e8e4f349a4f827008ab;;;Rock Bottom: Going back on my meds for good this time. ;;;Backstory.  I've struggled with uncontrollable focus since I was a child.  In High School I finally came to the place where I recognized I had something going on, and then came the ADHD diagnosis, and the drugs.  At first I was excited by them, and I got so much more done.  My writing improved, my life improved; my room stayed neat and organized, just how I'd always pictured I could do.  My homework?  Done.  AND I still had time left over for video games.   Then I quit.  I felt like a fucking bum taking the damn things.  I felt like I was cheating.  Somewhere between my acknowledgment of my limitations and my American inability to accept defeat I gave in and stopped taking the pills.  My symptoms returned in force, but I knew they would and I was prepared.  I became obsessive about time management techniques, breathing exercises, had various stints with exercises like running and boxing (boxing is amazing btw), and I kept my life in check.  Without the aid of the meds I not only increased my GPA I have been on my school's Dean's List every single semester.  I'm earning three degrees in parallel and I graduate this May.  Thanks to all my techniques and methodical planning, I accomplished what even regular people seldom do.   ADHD was, at best, an inconvenience that made my days a bit irritating, and a bit of a struggle, but goddamnit I beat the shit out of that ADHD.   Until I didn't.  I definitely still struggled.  Looking back I see that.  But it'd always been an inconvenience, never dangerous to me or anyone else.  That changed a few days ago.  I play music on my phone when I'm in my car, so it's always in front of me and sometimes at stopped traffic I play with it.  I was being particularly fidgety with my phone that day, and I kept coaching myself to put the damn thing down and pay attention to the road.  I did.  I beat my phone with self coaching, just like I've always beat my distractions.  But my mind was in a frenzy, the car wasn't keeping my attention, it seemed like every second I had to steer my eyes back to the road and off of the newest billboard or house rental advertisement or pretty girl driving a red — **WHAM**.  I rear ended a car that stopped in front of me.   I had time to stop.  I even saw them stop in my periphery.  I couldn't control my focus enough to hit the fucking brakes in time.  Fortunately, the road was in town and the traffic was stop and go (another reason I should have known to pay attention) so I wasn't even up to speed.  I probably hit them at about 20.  $2400 in damage to my car.  I've never been in a wreck before, and definitely never hit another car.  I drive professionally for crying out loud.   I've always been mad at my ADHD.  It's nagged me, cajoled me, stolen my focus and made relationships difficult (Yes, honey, I'm looking at the phone but I'm also listening to you promise), but it has never endangered my life or someone else's.  Now, I've never been more terrified of it and I would do anything to make sure I never put myself or someone I love at risk because they're in the car with me.  I already lied to everyone about what caused the accident, so I'll never be able to come clean about this to the people close to me.  Inside, though, I'm doing everything I can to make sure it never happens again.   **TL;DR**  I stopped taking pills because I'm a proud asshole, thought I was winning until I couldn't control myself and ended up rear-ending a car.  Scared shitless.  Going back on the meds.

dde61eecfc668ae1f460c714ed43cb9d578ec3926b905a4c90b817e6ff881b78;;;Anyone else find written communication easier than spoken? How can I improve my off-the-cuff speaking at work?;;;I've always been better at organizing my thoughts for writing than for speaking, which is great when I'm writing a chart note in a patient's file. It might take me a bit longer than most, but the notes are at least clear and relatively concise. But when I'm speaking, I have a really hard time getting to the point quickly and making a strong case for myself unless I've written everything out first. That no longer works because I just don't have the time at work - things move too fast and I'm already noticeably less efficient than my coworkers.  So, how can I get better at organizing my thoughts in a way that translates to speech well? This question came up last night when I was trying to make the case for a patient to get an operation. I was confident in my diagnosis but I was overridden by my boss. This morning of course, it turns out that my diagnosis was correct. I think if I could have articulated my thoughts more clearly and made a stronger case for my thoughts, things would have gone differently. No harm ultimately came from this situation, but it's a skill I know I need to improve. "Because I just know, ok?"isn't very convincing. :p

My sophomore year of high school, I peaked with dosage increases, and hit my proverbial rock bottom.  Depression, anxiety and irritability ran rampant during those times.  Since then, I've been reducing my dosages in an attempt to get off of the stuff. Right now, i'm on a fairly insignificant dosage compared to how much I weigh.  But even still, when I don't take my meds, I'm an unproductive zombie that can barely keep from drooling. Part of that is to be due to some kind of medicine dependence. I'm just not used to not being on medicine.  My life has been a perpetual struggle with mental disciplined.  I feel like I have accomplished a lot in the field, but still I wonder if medication is carrying me through it.  And, probably as a function of my type A personality, I feel like the end goal for me will be to be able to function completely fine off of medication. Anybody else going through the same thing who can give any advice?

I get really REALLY frustrated while doing school work, particularly homework as many classes I have use some kind of online homework system.  My frustrations come from the fact that, while I do the problem, I make some kind of mistake and when I submit the answer and the program basically goes "lols, you got it wrong. -5 points of your score," and that's it, no help nothing.  By the time I figure out my mistakes (usually on the 2nd or 3rd time) I am getting half credit for the problem and despite doing ALL of the homework, it's tanking my grade.  I get frustrated because I know homework should be an easy 30%-ish points on your overall grade and because I don't do so well on my exams I need every point I can get and it gets bad that I quit doing homework because, I'm getting basically the same grade with out the frustration and headache.  Is anyone having a similar problems and how did you fix/get around it.  TL:DR: I am getting frustrated with a homework system that seems to be tailored to be the bane of my grades

I constantly pinned this on my ADHD for a few years, but then my mom concluded that I was just being a little bitch who used ADD as an excuse not to do work. She said that if she could overcome her ADD and be the most fucking organized person on the damn planet, I could do my work. (which at this point, I seriously think she was misdiagnosed with ADD because she shows **no goddamned symptoms**)  Here's where I made the fatal mistake.....I believed her.  Enter the worst years of my life. Constant self-loathing, hating myself over my compulsive need to be doing something not productive even though I know I should be doing something else, and even kicking myself (literally) to get my stuff done.  Onto the medicine. One time my mom took my medicine to make sure it was safe for me to take (more reasonable than it sounds, I had been on a medicine that completely ruined my ability to sleep just prior to this medication), and she claims that she felt "extremely productive", and actually cleaned the entire house and half an hour. She said that if it could do that to her, I should be able to get my work done.  This time, I did not believe her. I had never felt anything like what she described, and I'm pretty sure she just went full-on wacko on Vyvanse. Despite this, I still hated myself for not getting my stuff done.  I found this subreddit today. I realize now that this is not entirely my fault. My medication doesn't work the way it's supposed to, but that isn't the problem. My mom always told me to "quit bitching" about my ADD, but I realize now that those weren't just complaints....those were my cries for help. I've lived with ADD my whole life and my entire family has been everything but helpful about it.  In mere hours, you guys have shifted my entire paradigm about what I'm dealing with now. This isn't some stupid excuse I use not to do work- this is a **real problem**, and some people on the Internet who I don't even know have helped me more in two hours than my own family has over the past five years. I just wanted to say thanks.
d1ba3780776087fb2b648c3ea964cd9f1ddccc527db8b1cf72f6b3af15cacd4f;;;How do I talk to my parents about ADHD?;;;My parents are very loving and supportive people. Despite all the problems I've had in life, they've been encouraging and wonderful to me through everything.  Except when, several years ago, I tried talking to my parents about ADHD. I tried to explain that all the problems they continually notice about me follow the exact outline for ADHD-PI, to which they responded that ADHD isn't real, it's a trick for parents to drug their children instead of teaching them discipline, that if I even tried talking to a doctor about it I would end up addicted to methamphetamines, etc.  It was probably the worst single event of my life. I don't blame my parents, because I love them dearly and I know they think they're doing the best for me... but I saw an ADHD specialist last week, and after talking for a few hours he told me he thought I should try taking 10 mg of Adderall XR, and to talk to my parents about it afterwards.  So now I need to talk to my family about this, but I don't know how to. I've never been more depressed or self ashamed than when I mentioned possibly seeing a specialist years ago - and I can only imagine their reaction to this will be much worse.  I don't know how to talk with them. I think they will tell me they'd rather I fail college off medication than ace it on medication. I think they will tell me again that it'll lead to a life of drug abuse - despite my doctor giving me only 10 mg of the extended release.  I don't know what to do, because I know they firmly believe ADHD isn't real. Can anyone please spare some advice on what I can even do at this point? I'd really appreciate it - thank you.  *Tl;dr, Parents don't believe ADHD is real, got incredibly mad at me and over reacted when I considered seeking help. Now I've been diagnosed and have no idea how to tell them, help?*

Being diagnosed with ADHD/ADD and all?;;;I understand, this might probably be the last thing you want to hear.  Sometimes this thought might come across your mind when you're struggling with work or when you are thinking about yourself as person; using ADHD/ADD to define yourself, your thoughts, your actions, and everything about you. I do it too.  But recently, I got really tired of it. I wasn't mad at myself, I wasn't mad at my teachers and the people around me, I wasn't even mad at my ADHD/ADD.  I was mad at the fact that ADHD/ADD has become the answer and reason that has prevented me from reaching my full potential. Yeah, having accommodations at school help, having understanding teachers and family is great, but it seems like I'm the only one who doesn't want to say, "You know what? Fuck this ADD. Why does it have to put me on another platform without anywhere to go. Why does it have to be some sort of characteristic that I am bound by, with everyone around me treating me like a special human with special needs, unable to go left or right, up or down?"  I see posts here all the time saying how nobody understands what they're going through, as if they are restricted by an idea that they are and *always* will be slower than others.  What? Really? Doesn't anyone want to overcome their ADHD/ADD? Is everybody just relieved they've found a reason?!  I am not saying ADHD/ADD is false or a real thing, we have all experienced these symptoms as they are very similar and relevant to one another, but can't we have a sense of initiative and drive?  Does ADHD/ADD settle things with one single diagnosis? Has your fate been sealed?  **NO**.  I am tired of going through these struggles and being placed on another special platform. I want to pave my own path according to my initiative and drive; in this way, let ADHD/ADD be an obstacle, not a burden.  LET ADHD/ADD BE AN OBSTACLE. A TEMPORARY HURDLE. NOT A LIFELONG BURDEN.  It would be so easy to dismiss this post and go about your day, being another human with ADHD/ADD. Wouldn't it?  It's not about being lazy, it's about being indifferent and unmotivated. That shouldn't be related to ADHD/ADD shouldn't it?  **TL;DR I'M TIRED OF BEING HELD DOWN BY ADHD/ADD. WHY CAN'T WE TRY AND OVERCOME IT INSTEAD OF ACCEPTING OUR FATE?** ***LET ADHD/ADD BE AN OBSTACLE, NOT A BURDEN.***

In reviewing my case,  he mentioned that generic Concerts is pretty much crap.  The reason: although "bio-identical"  the time release function of the generic is virtually nonexistent. That means that it spikes and fades over 6-8 hours, vs. giving you a 12 hour dosage.   This also explains why moving from 72-108mg made my heart race and why I tend to crash in the late afternoon. I'll be filling a new prescription tomorrow - for the real thing.   Something to think about if you take a generic time release med.   And for other Canadians here - Safeway offers Concerta at the generic price. They have some deal with the manufacturer, according to the shrink. Just FYI.

Thanks :);;;So like I said I just got diagnosed two days ago. I'm going to set up an appointment with my doctor and talk to them about medication and that kind of thing and do a bunch of research. I was just wondering if anyone had any general advice, or anything that I might not realize having just been diagnosed.   I really don't know what this diagnosis means for me right now, just trying to figure it all out. I don't really have anyone I can go to for advice about this so and I'm kind of unsure how to even talk about it with people so that's why I came here. Thanks!
49eec904308590f6ab35e69e42d9fa1eb3cef85df2fe6acce5037a1c541dda40;;;Ritalin saved my grades last semester, but lingering symptoms starting to infuriate;;;A brief history of myself: I was originally diagnosed with ADHD in 2003 and more or less forced onto Adderall by my school, purely to combat behavioral issues. After 3 years of daily medication I had finally learned to shut up (and have always been regarded as extremely quiet since,) but not before going through major issues with anxiety and depression that ultimately ended with me dropping the Adderall and only taking an antidepressant, followed by several years of no medication.  For years I thought I had been misdiagnosed, as I always did well academically throughout high school and freshman year of college. Sure, my mind wandered quite a bit and I spent waaaay longer on assignments than I should have, but I figured it was basically normal and I left it at that.  Fast forward to fall of sophomore year. The difficulty of my classes shot through the roof, and I was already committed to some extremely time consuming extracurriculars. I couldn't take it and and eventually became depressed to the point of mentally shutting down. A couple of days before I'd done a little research and taken some online tests, and everything pointed to moderate to severe depression. Big surprise there. In doing that though, I stumbled across a lot of information about ADHD, including this subreddit. Practically every symptom I read about applies or has at some point applied to me. I can relate to a disturbing number of "does anyone else...?" posts.  Well hell. That explains a lot.  Went to the doctor and was started on antidepressants (Wellbutrin) first to make sure that wasn't the whole problem. It did help, but the main problem I was experiencing remained (focus - I could seriously stare blankly at a statics problem for 2 hours without writing a single thing down - either I would continually start to do something and forget my thought process, or the gears just wouldn't turn.) So I got a prescription for 20mg of Ritalin to be taken as needed, and I couldn't have been happier with the results. It was still a tough semester, but I made it through and actually got pretty good grades.  So that was last semester. I'll avoid going on another tangent explaining why, but last week I got to thinking about how my meds were doing after a few months. I think I've built up some tolerance, but the Ritalin and Wellbutrin have been working pretty much how they should be working. I did, however, realize some areas where the meds are still lacking.  - One minor thing is that even though I know taking a Ritalin in the afternoon (after the morning one has worn off) will IMMEDIATELY get me to work, I have a hell of a time convincing myself to do it, sometimes after hours have been wasted. I'll just chalk that up to self discipline.  - By far the worst issue I have right now is listening comprehension, especially in an instructional setting. I can focus directly on a professor and hear every word they say, but I physically cannot process what is being said. If there are notes on a PowerPoint or blackboard that I need to write down, I can't even hear them. What really worries me though is how this will affect me in a professional environment. In a classroom, it's annoying, but I can survive. In an actual job though, I am terrified of being immediately labeled an incompetent idiot because I can't process or retain spoken instructions. I am absolutely awful at labs for this exact reason, and it's all resulted in a massive inferiority complex that affects the HELL out of me because I see it as completely justifiable.  - I experience something similar to the above with reading, but it's much less severe and debilitating. If I'm reading for pleasure, there's no issue, but even with Ritalin I cannot for the life of me read a chapter out of a textbook or any sort of lengthy technical document, which I generally consider a waste of time anyway because I retain next to nothing unless I spend huge amounts of time dissecting and srudying. Again, I can mostly get away with it in the academic world, but being able to read and understand specifications and other kinds of technical works are going to be a fairly important part of my career, and while I think I'll slowly get better at it with time and experience, I still don't want to add to the notion that I am unworthy of employment.  - Even when I know what I'm doing, I'd say I'm generally slower at doing it than most, which, when I'm around other people who are doing the same work, adds to the inferiority complex.  So that was way longer than I had intended and I realized about halfway through that it's the middle of the night and hardly anyone is awake to read this, but basically what I'm asking is, has anyone else been through a similar situation? What did you do about it? I was refered to a doctor who specializes in ADHD and am in the process of making an appointment, but I thought I'd check here while I'm waiting to see if there are any other meds or coping strategies I could look into.  **TL;DR** Ritalin will get me through college fine, but I'm afraid I'll be woefully unprepared for the working world due to some issues that remain.

When I stand up or do much walking, I get a tiny bit lightheaded.   I've also had two episodes so far where my vision sort of shifts and I start hyperventilating.   The first time (last Friday), I was feeling a bit of GI discomfort (odd because I hadn't eaten *too* much that day) and when I bent down and sideways in a funny way to type on my laptop, I suddenly felt like I was about to puke. By the time I reached the toilet with a cooking pot in my hand, ready for leakage from either end, my vision was twisty and dark. I'd just managed to bark out to my mom that I wasn't feeling well, and I'm surprised I managed to get that out. I sat on the toilet with my face in my hands, elbows on my knees, breathing hard through my nose, for next five minutes or so.  The second time, last Sunday, I was enjoying a nice shower when I felt the feeling again (minus the nausea). *Oh no,* I thought, and I went to grab my towel and run for my bed, but it was not to be. I either lost balance or caught my flip-flop on the wall of my bathtub and went down. Oddly enough, though we have a tile floor, it didn't hurt and I only have a colorless bruise. I spent a few seconds on the floor before I could push myself up and put some towels on the toilet so I could sit. I spent the next five minutes in the same position as before, then stood up, washed my face, and wobbled back to my room.   This hasn't happened since Sunday.  More info:  These both happened at about 1am, so would tiredness have something to do with it? My appetite has been kinda low, so I thought blood sugar might play a part too. I'm also on Celexa 20mg, if it helps. The first incident also happened a few hours after I took two capsules (not sure of the size of them) of sodium docusate. I've had some difficulty with urination in the past few days too - I just peed for the first time in at least two days, maybe more. It didn't hurt or anything, but it seems like I've gotten a bladder of steel. I've got a normal build-5'6.5, 150lb, female.    Does anyone have any experience with this? Does it go away after a while?   Thanks!

I believe that anyone educated on ADHD could have spotted my behaviour was typical of ADD. Of course, this is not the only symptom I have, but after chronic procrastination, this is the one that bothers me the most.   I stumbled upon an ADD article about 3 months later, procrastinated 3 months before calling a doctor, who didnt know much about ADD - he recommended me to a specialist - procrastinated again. Then, last october I started working on a new project, hyperfocused, leaving aside everything else; quickly, I got many demands for my service - I think it's the only reason why i didnt give up like i did for my other projects.    So, i created a company in december, felt overwhelmed with everything associated with it, and after realizing i wasn't even able to keep up with the quote requests (wouldn't even take me that much time: I get about 2 per day, and sending a quote takes me about 30mn max), I realised I needed help. I took an appointment in January, went last week and got diagnosed with ADD - no surprise at all (i had no doubt, i have many symptoms of the inattentive type), I just felt relieved.  I'm on Concerta 36mg (I live in Spain, and I think Adderall is not legal here), but it doesnt work, at all! Today (4 hours ago), i took 2 pills, just to try (i know, i shouldnt, etc.. I won't do it again tomorrow). It still doesn't work. As a proof, I have 10 important quotes to send, waiting for days, weeks, even a month. it's my only objective for today, and im posting this thread to reddit instead.   I don't even know why i post this, i have no question to ask you. I'm just desperate, I really need this business to work, it's my only source of income, and with this irrational behavior of mine, i'm just shooting myself in the foot.

Looking for input!;;;Background: I am also diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and still trying to get that under control for which I take 30 mg of buspar( for 15 months) three times a day and klonopin (for 1 month) in the morning and evening.  I had to switch psychiatrists due to my age to be able to get treated for ADD.  He thinks i may also have OCD and started me on 10 mg of paxil last week. I took 5 mg of Ritalin at 8am &amp; 12pm for one week and am now taking 10mg twice daily.  My insurance won't pay for the ritilan BC of my age as well.  I am a junior nursing major and in the last year there has been a significant decline in my grades and ability to do homework and perform well in clinical. I withdrew from my clinical class (maternity. And pediatrics) this semester to try and get everything under control. I am now only taking 6 credits.  The psychologist that diagnosed me said he thought I would be put on concerta or adderall.   Because I am new to all of this I am just looking for some input on what meds are good and what bad side effects they come with. Also open to any suggestions for daily life.

We all have to start somewhere.;;;##### WIN WEDNESDAY!!!  *Just wanted to remind people to **upvote this post**. Recently, our weekly threads get pushed off the page pretty quick. More upvotes = more wins = more people getting inspired (it is a cycle).*  #####Science behind Win Wednesday  * Scientists think our brain has a built in negativity bias by reacting more to a negative stimulus. In effect, our brain is like velcro for negative experiences and teflon for positive ones.   * Painful experiences are usually more memorable than positive ones and lasting, good relationships typically need at least a 5:1 ratio of positive to negative interactions.  * By **tilting toward the good** you are leveling the playing field.    * **Instead of positive experiences washing through you like water through a sieve, they’ll collect in the implicit memory deep down in your brain.**  * **Soak in the positive events in your life**   * By pausing and holding that positive feeling for a BIT longer, you are slowly changing the wiring of your brain.   *I have much more information on the neuroscience of recognizing the good, let me know if you want more info.*  ***  Win Wednesday is a chance to focus on our accomplishments for the week. Doing this enough WILL change your brain for the better!  ###***The Sacred Creed of Win Wednesday:***  * **Each and every one of us have victories every week, be they great or small. But in Win Wednesday, *no* victory is truly a small one.**  * **Whatever "level" you happen to be at, progress is *always* a cause for celebration!**   * **Please don’t discount anything you have done. The whole point is to share how YOU won, and did not let your ADHD win!** Check out the examples to see what we mean!**  *** * The point of Win Wednesday is equally **to share our wins AND celebrate the wins of others!** If you do or don’t have a win, feel free to give positive support and cheer to those posting (not just upvoting)!  * **Each week Win Wednesday gets hundreds of views, but only 5 people replying to the winning comments...let’s change things this week!** Just saying “good job” means a lot to someone who has been struggling!  ***  ##### PHENOMENAL EXAMPLES FROM PAST WEEKS: (updated 2/27)  * All the dishes are washed, dried and put away, and have stayed that way since Saturday * I asked a girl on a date and she said yes. * I cleaned out my fridge and organized leftovers! * Agreed to participate in a very challenging dance performance that I very likely would have declined in the past. * have kept impulse buys to a minimum * Learned how to make bullet points on Reddit:p * No heroin or sleeping pills since thursday I think. Planning on going until forever * Made a wedding decision about the officiant (finally)  ##### We love you, /r/adhd! BE PROUD and celebrate with each other! -- *your community managers.*  #####  *** *Sorry I don't have time to update the recent wins this week! I am stoked to be back to /r/ADHD after taking a break for a month (missed you guys). Hopefully we can get some new blood posting today!*  -computerpsych
0b365913cda168889c79c3ad316d7f2ce240a0917fbd9ed1c171bb241dcfdcb1;;;You guys have any fun hyper-focus stories?;;;The idea is, as I'm sure most of you know, that people with ADHD can focus on something so intensely that it drowns out everything else. This is apparently something exclusive to us "blessed" with ADHD. Anyway, my favorite time it happened to me was in 2nd grade when we had a reading time in the middle of the day. I got so enveloped in my book that I didn't even notice the teacher telling me to stop reading. I only stopped reading when I finished the book and the class was in the middle of a math lesson.
eda305ef8901409ae82731621293605a79f690dcd0ca6701e146e6723b649403;;;Friend is convinced ADHD doesn't 'exist'. Believed it is a result of poor diet/exercise/too much TV. How do I respond to them?;;;I will keep this as short as possible.  So, friend of mine is convinced that things like depression, anxiety, bi-polar, ADHD only exist because of consequences of lifestyle - poor diet, exercise, lazy habits, etc.  They do not believe that prescription medication should be given to people with ADHD and that that "fish oil, exercise, hardwork and structure" should be able to reduce the symptoms of the disorder. They also claimed that "If I was doing something I loved then I wouldn't need to take medication" (I won't exclaim why I started to take medication but it sure as hell is for more reasons than being able to study).   I showed them a Russell Barkley video to try to alter their point of view.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyDliT0GZpE  They responded by saying: "So in giving them more accountability, you're conditioning them (their genes) to react in a different way. I like the way he looks at it."  While this is somewhat true, (external organization is necessary to lead a cluttered mind) is it me, or did they just twist Barkley's lecture to reaffirm their stance? (controllable disorder)  This infuriates me because although I'm open to the potential that neuroplasticity is capable of strengthening frontal-lobe regions responsible for the deficits associated with ADHD via external structure and organization techniques, I resent that statement because it implies that my social gaffes/inattentiveness/lack of motivation were under my control all along. I refuse to believe that my failures/shortcomings are a result of some controllable characteristic. I refuse to believe that I am equipped with an unquenchable drive to fail, welcome stress and disappointment, or be as mediocre as possible in life.  So, do we tell someone with cystic fibrosis to exercise and eat well and think about breathing "properly" that they should be able to, in time, cure themselves?  "Conditioning their genes to react in a different way"  I don't know where to begin with this.  I would really appreciate any advice regarding how to respond to their viewpoint and hopefully change their stance. (Although, I realize this battle may be futile). They have a little brother with ADHD and this friend constantly blames their parents as being responsible for their ADHD. I don't want this kid to grow up being told that they are a failure, lazy, etc.
b763b57e209209d21e29bcd9d1ad3d7387da1bd1a51a6ed7ef6d57556048454d;;;I am going to write a letter to my university's administration asking them to change their policy of refusing to treat or diagnose ADHD at the campus health center.;;;The health center at my university is not allowed to treat or diagnose ADHD. Due to the rigorous nature of college, it is one of the places where people with ADHD are most in need of access to treatment.  Is it fair to deny them the right to medical help because of the possibility that a small number of them could end up selling or abusing their medication? Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, and borderline personality disorder are all treated and diagnosed by the psychiatrist on campus.  I feel that people with ADHD are being discriminated against. Many students do not have health insurance, so their only access to healthcare is through the university. These students don't have the money to see a doctor at a private practice. And why should they have to?  I haven't looked into this very far yet, but I feel very strongly about it and I want the letter to go to the right place and I want it to be persuasive and accurate. Does anyone have any suggestions as to where to start, or what I should write, etc? Better yet, does anyone have a counterargument to bring up?  **TL;DR:** My school won't diagnose or treat ADHD. I feel this is discrimination against people with the disorder, so I'm going to write them a letter asking them to change their policy. Any thoughts?  **EDIT:** I should clarify a couple of things:   1) I already have a diagnosis and am being treated. I had originally tried to do this through the health center, but was denied. I had to wait a long time until I could go home, six hours away, during winter break and see my psychiatrist. My insurance provider only operates in certain regions.  2) My university does provide accommodations for people with disabilities, ADHD included. As a student with ADHD, I can take tests in a separate location and have priority registration, among other things. It's the health center, a separate entity, that does not provide diagnoses or medication for ADHD even though it does so for other psychiatric conditions.  **Also**, thanks for all of your responses! I'm sorry I can't provide better answers for those of you who are just as curious as I am about the situation. I posted this so I could get your advice and opinions before I launched into research and then writing a letter. When I do the research and find out what's what, I will definitely do a follow-up post!
dcf783d59a1b7fcac1f80e60800474d55b34e974a797e20905e1dbd63fca81ea;;;I'm sick of taking medicine. Is there an Alternative?;;;Hey everyone. I'm really nervous about posting here. Knowing how harsh the internet can be. But I'm giving it a shot.  Since the 3rd grade, I have been taking medicine to help cope with my ADD and Anxiety. ADD runs on my dad's side of the family and Anxiety is very common on my mom's. Anyway, i have been in and out of medication after medication, pill after pill after pill after pill and I'm sick of it. I'm 19 now and i took my first year off of medication halfway though highschool and I can say, I've never felt better. I feel like myself, I'm more creative and happier.  I wish I could say the same about my grades, though... My first HS semester was awesome. After i went off my meds, they dropped so hard i barely graduated. Now I'm in college and I can't do a single fucking thing. My stress gets the better of me and I can't focus for more than 5 seconds without drifting off into nowhere. I can't sit in class without moving or doing something, anything to change my attention. I, without a doubt will be on academic probation after only taking 2 damn classes.   My parents don't give a shit. They both work great jobs but never went to college. And they are trying to compare and to tell me they know what it's like. They tell me I'm lazy that I need to grow up and im making eveything up.   Telling this to a kid that can't even play a video game if he wanted to, really fuckin' kills. Yes, i cant focus on a video game.  I have tried everything from a shrink to hypnotherapy and I'm pretty sure sold my soul to satan to have a normal mind. But nothing is working. I've been changing my diet to high-nutrient foods. Nothing.  I needed to rant somewhere. I just want to know if there is an alternative to drugs  TL:DR Sick of using medication, is there just as an effective alternative?  Thanks guys  EDIT: I'm active 24/7. I play high-level hockey, run all the time, gym, airsoft, rugby. So physical activity does not help me.
8331f5abe93d976f31ed8e9fbc6def59da58404389399891ffbfea763ae45f44;;;I just want to give up;;;I just can't do school. Or, homework and classwork for that matter. No matter how hard i try to get on top of my work; no matter how many sleepless nights spent slaving away on homework that was assigned three weeks ago, pertaining to a test I already aced.  Other kids in my classes, classes full of "over achievers" who make it all look so easy. Well you know what? I am an over achiever, just not in the same sense.  While I've seen many people just give up, not even bothering showing up to class because their learning disabilities are just too cumbersome, I stay strong.  I've earned my GPA of a mediocre 3.17.  Where to others, school work just comes so easily to them; but for me, it doesn't.  I simply can't sit down and tackle my personal mt Everest homework when everything from all angles around me scream for my attention, gnawing away at my sanity.  Whenever a teacher ridicules me in front of the class for I am the only one who somehow failed to complete the mostly insignificant assignment, I have no other choice but to slump at my desk and absorb their condescending remarks.  Now, to them I'm just a slacker, who doesn't have the work ethic to make it in society.  Oh, could they ever be so wrong.  They try to give me accomidations, like I am somehow below my peers, so that I develop into what they think that I already am, a wasted heap of cells, unfit to work at the same standards as everybody else.  NO! I can learn to live with my ADHD, find ways to work around it, not just in the form of a toxic pill that is supposed to fix it all.  I CAN improve. I MUST!  Just now, I completed an entire unit of math without missing a single assighnment, where often I can be lucky to complete half.  Within a week I have brought my grades for this quarter from a c- average to somewhere near a B+.  I am only a sophmore, I have room to improve, the time to do it in, and ever so much the burning desire to do so.  I need to start small, taking shorter and less frequent breaks while working on homework, completing class work as it is worked on in class instead of hurriedly copying someone else's moments before it is collected.  I will be an A student by the time I kiss my wretched high school behind, proudly wearing my cap and gown because I will know I worked ten times as hard to get there then most of theses awfull fucks. I WON'T GIVE UP!   Wow, it feels so good to have written this.

My parents paid someone for this?;;;I was doing my physics homework and i had a thought, and subsequently was not doing my physics homework. My parents paid a therapist to do this with me. Twice a week or so (Idk i was like 8), i would go into an office and clap in a rhythm for like 4 hours.....   http://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/video/interactive-metronome-adhd  I can't remember if it actually helped, but i know i have a better concept of rhythmic timing than most other musicians. What i do remember, is that in that damn waiting room, some twisted son of a bitch convinced me to trade my Ampharous, that i slaved over to evolve from a Flaaffy, for his stupid Entei that he renamed "Exodia" and taught like 3 HMs. I treated him like Jon Snow.... That's a two-fer with references. i should get a a medal............  I should probably get back to physics.......
e215bcaec0c43e8c21fb92b78ec81a5c63cdff295e218c5381811c2343cf6364;;;Un-diagnosed 26 year old male needing some advice.;;;Hey guys, I am glad I have found this subreddit as I need some guidance/advice on my situation.    I don't want to be that guy who says "I think I have ADHD" but I want your opinion on whether it is worth looking into and seeing a doctor about it.    First Some background:   I am 26 year old male working as a professional software developer.  My career is fairly good but I always feel like I got where I am from a combination of luck and a fair amount of bullshitting my way through.  Growing up, both my brothers were diagnosed with ADHD (I am middle child).  My mum also has some form of it but never diagnosed.  I was never diagnosed/never taken to even see if I had it however I have always had most/all the symptons of ADHD:     - inability to focus on anything for more than a few minutes   - extremely disorganised and forgetful even when I am trying my hardest to not be     - inability to control my emotions and extremely self destructive behavior.  I find it really difficult to take criticism and I have explosive anger that results in me doing things like (breaking my hand punching a wall, punching myself in the face, slicing my wrist to elbow with a razor blade, etc).  This is often caused by being really frustrated but luckily it does not escalate like this unless I am really pushed.    - my inner dialogue is very loud and often distracts me from listening to basic conversations to the point where my current girlfriend is getting fed up and thinks I never listen to her.  In meetings at work my mind wanders elsewhere within the first minute of the meeting even when I am trying hard to focus on what is being said.    - i am an extreme procrastinator (ironically I am typing this at work), I will leave all tasks till the absolute last minute and then I am able to hyperfocus and get things done.    - i pretty much forget everything that I am supposed to do such as last year I forget to setup my council tax direct debit and after 6 months of letters to fix my direct debit and me forgetting to fix it EVERY day i got a summary warrant and had my council tax moved to a debt collector with the threat of jail time if I did not pay it.  I will forget things my partner tells me on a constant everynight basis and it infuriates her.  I have tried to organise myself and set up reminders but I can never stick to being organised for more than a few days at best.    - I am pretty impulsive as well, since the age of 19 I have racked up 75,000 dollars of debt.  In 2009 I got made redundant at my company (probably for turning up late to work everyday) but they gave me a 40,000 dollar payout.  Not only did I blow though that money in 2 years, i also racked up 20,000 dollars credit card debt ontop of that.  I never check my bank statements and never been able to save any of my money despite earning a good salary.    - I have an addictive personality but I don't know if this is related.  I have been addicted to smoking for 10 years now and I also struggled with alcoholism for about a 5 months in 2011 where I was drinking about 35 pints of beer a week consistently.     - I always feel tired and worn out like I have not had enough sleep despite "getting" 8 hours a night.  This has caused me problems at work because I often am late.  I got a written warning for being late at every single job I have worked at.    Anyway, my partner is suggesting I go see a doctor and I think there is some merit to doing so.  I am curious how I even broach this subject to a doctor without sounding like one of those dickheads that's just in it for the legal stimulants.  I feel there is a stigma attached to thinking you have ADHD these days before you are diagnosed with it.   Do you guys think it sounds like ADHD or do you think I have something else, or nothing at all?  I really want to be sharp like a fox, and not be like the person I have described above.

What is that booster?;;;I'm finding that vyvanse doesn't really last for my lifestyle, i need it to last around 14-16, its only lasting from 8-10.  What booster are you using? I'm thinking of either using Adderall or Dexedrine. I'm learning towards the Adderall for the kick for the afternoon slump.  Are there any dangers of mixing the two medications? (L and D amphetamines)   Thanks!
a90bd3953db50232148c13a8c94fdfb6f5046e5bc6fabe71ae527559cfe03629;;;anyone else?;;;alright so I was diagnosed with ADHD I guess as a child, my parents, mom/dad whoever had me on medication's practically all my life (untill the age of 18 where I said I was not going to take them anymore) I'm also left handed :D, anyways I'm somewhat disapointed a little in how things are? I'm a very energetic young man who likes to have ALLOT! of fun, i.e. it is quite hard to maintain a job, and some other things.. wich I have not yet expereienced... also in advanced feel free to spell check me because I'm not googleing any words for I dont really care XD (quite the good speller/talker when I want to be... or whatever) the reason why is because I like to talk, I talk allot and try to make people my friends while also doing my job.. but everyone likes 2 have a problem with me, wich is fine but gets quite anoying when you have to find a new job every 3-4 months because you cant hold a job down (currently 21 and have had no more then 5-6 jobs, current is mc.donalds), I honestly really dont know right now haha, but I was just wondering if anyone else get haters for doing you.. I Guess! meh whatever just a random rant I sapose  OH also! what is a throwaway account?
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Saw a psychiatrist for the first time yesterday. She believes I do not have ADHD based off a 5 minute meeting and two questions. I whole-heartedly disagree with her, but then I'm not the professional here. Really need some help on how to continue, details inside.;;;So the meeting started with her asking if there is any history of mental illness or disorder in my family. My mom was with me and she said there was none, even though she's admitted to me that she had ADHD as a child, but it went away as she got older. I don't know why she said there was none, it didn't seem helpful.  Anyway, the second question was how I performed in elementary school. I said I never really had a huge problem with grades, but I remembered getting in more trouble than others for things like fidgeting and moving too much and a lack of attention. I also remember having weird quirks. If a lot of people were at my house, I'd need to isolate myself for a while due to sensory overload. I never had a big group of friends, maybe 2 or 3 really close ones.  After that, the psychiatrist said she doesn't believe I have ADHD. With no family history of mental disorder and no apparent issues with academics at a young age, it doesn't seem likely that I have it. At this point I began to angry at what seemed like a half-assed, rushed diagnosis. Two questions? Neither of which seem like deciding factors? What kind of diagnosis is that? I realize she's the professional and I'm a 21 year old student, but still...  She said it's more likely that I have a high level of anxiety (a common comorbid disorder of ADHD), or simply developed poor organizational habits over the years. By this time, I had started to dismiss her diagnosis as it did seem anywhere near accurate, very rushed, and very assumptive. I kept my mouth shut, but I was upset. I told her that my family doctor diagnosed me with ADHD 3 months ago and prescribed me Adderall XR, which I've been taking since, and that it has noticeably improved my life and state of mind, while decreasing the ADHD symptoms. She said that even if the Adderall improves aspects of my life such as productivity, motivation, and confidence, that is not indicative of the presence of ADHD.  Now, I realize that non-professional self-diagnosis is not very reliable and can be dangerous. However, I have every single symptom of ADHD-PI. Every single one, at a chronic level. As in, they negatively affect my life nearly every hour of every day. Not just sometimes when I don't feel like doing an assignment or when I forget to pay a bill or something. I'm saying that even the things that I enjoy doing are put off and unintentionally ignored, both very simple and very important tasks are forgotten routinely until the 11th hour, anything past ~48 hours in the future is essentially static in my brain (i.e. meaningless, unorganized fuzz), nearly all motivation in my life is external (i.e. fear of the consequences for not doing something), I'm horribly at maintaining relationships (never had a girlfriend), no ability to delegate and maintain focus on what's important (insert "Wall of TVs" analogy here), and the list could go on forever. These are not common issues for most people.  At this point, I've done all I can think to do on my own to change myself, but nothing's worked. I told her this, and she said would recommend talking to the psychologist at their clinic. I was happy with this because I feel like a psychologist will want to ask more questions and really dive deeper, while her two questions barely scratched the surface.  I have some questions. Was she correct in saying I likely do not have ADHD, and more likely have high anxiety or bad habits? Will a psychologist be more in depth? If the psychologist decides I don't have ADHD and just lack organizational skills, could that nullify my prescription? That would be devastating considering how much it's helped in the past 3 months.  Thanks for any help.

Looking to get one.;;;Hey, I was diagnosed with ADD several years ago, one of the many counselors I spoke to over the years HIGHLY recommended I get a wrist watch. He said it was almost essential to make sure I can keep track of what I'm doing, to make sure I stay on task, etc.  Anyone ever do that? I never got one. But I think I will now. I figure these days there's gotta be something cool.   I'm hoping maybe there's one we can put a calendar on it, sync it with our cell phones, maybe it'll vibrate to get your attention, etc.
9fd8e6387db7e248d42f5eb455071bb7a304804f7222901c0a7f2889d416926b;;;I just can't put myself to work on important things.;;;I've been struggling with concentration for about 4 years now. When I graduated from high school, I tried to follow a university course about Psychology. I failed, since I just could not put myself to work. Around that same time I was put into a therapy group with other young adults  who had depression and anxiety disorders just like me. (to be more precise, I have Dysthymia (a mild chronic depression disorder), social anxiety disorder and a avoidance personality disorder).  I went to a new school about game design, where I still reside on now, and tried to make the best of it. But also there, I delivered everything at the last possible moment, even skipping some lessons. Luckily I had a school councilor there who cut me a lot of slack due to my mental disorders. But school right now still isn't going great for me. I can't concentrate and focus on my homework.   I did the therapy group for about 2 years and have now stopped.  That's a bit of my history. Now my current problem:  About a month ago, I was offered a freelance job that would earn me around 1500 euro's, which is a lot of money for a poor student like me. I need to make a couple of digital video's for a company in order to earn that money.  But, the problem is, is that I just cannot put myself to work on this. This is not something that is new to me. I have struggled to work on important things like school or other things that would earn me lot's of money. I put them off till the last possible moment, and deliver a thus mediocre job.  This is really frustrating. I know exactly what I have to do, but I get distracted very easily (by the Internet mostly).   For example, I would start up my video editing program, would start up Youtube so I can start a playlist with my favorite music aaaaaaaaaand my attention is gone from my project. I now browse Youtube for about 30 minutes, which brings me to new stimuli that I get distracted by and before I know it it's 3 hours later.  Another aspect is a very sickening feeling when I try to go against this feeling and try to work on the project. But it makes my stomach twist. I suddenly really really really don't want to work on the project. This is strange, since when I now think about the project, I love video editing, I love to create something from scratch.   So for about a month now, I have tried and tried and tried to work on this project. But I haven't gone past some words written on paper about how the video needs to look like. This video is due next week, and it's far from finished. I basically haven't even started yet.  This week I went to my doctor, explained to him my lack of concentration for the past 4 years. He told me I might have ADD. So I am going back there next week to test for ADD. He said that if I have ADD, I would probably get Ritalin, to help me concentrate.  I really really hope I have ADD, it would explain a lot. I can't live like this any longer. I hate my lack of concentration. I am pretty smart and I want to show it to the world, but right now I just can't. I tried ritalin once, and it made me able to concentrate for 5 hours. I felt euphoric, like I could finally make all the homework I want! I was so happy. But at that time when I tried the ritalin, I still was in therapy, and my group psychologist said to me that I probably don't have ADD, that I should stop taking Ritalin. So I stopped. But I've always felt that something was wrong with me and I feel very strongly that the psychologist was wrong about me too. I think she mis-diagnosed my ADD. I think I have it. I did a few test on the internet that all said I have ADD. Guess I will find out if I have it or not next week at the doctor's office.  ---  Does anyone recognise themselves in the small story I wrote above? I would love to hear your perspectives.  TLDR: Have a big project coming up, want to concentrate, but I just can't. Doctor things I might have ADD, but my previous psychologist doesn't think I have ADD. This make me confused. I want to know what's wrong with me and I hope I have ADD so that I can focus my energy upon trying to learn live with that, via Ritalin and what else.

As a caveat for the rest of my post, I was diagnosed with a mild manifestation of the disorder, and have done pretty well up to this point - Master's educated with a good job and wife and house.  And herein lies what I've thought about in the last month.  I feel like because I've waited until 30 to receive a diagnosis, it forced me to develop coping mechanisms that have enabled me to achieve before medication and therapy.  Things like PDAs and (later) a smart phone, forcing myself to find private spaces for focus, and a willingness to accept imperfection have helped me significantly.  If I had started some kind of regimen in middle or high school, would I have developed those skills?  I'm not sure.  I feel our modern culture does everything possible to avoid struggle and pain, and so we often medicate ourselves with whatever we can.  I think the last thirty years have made me a better person, irrespective of the times I screwed up because of distraction, didn't pay a whole lot of attention to friendships and certain conversations, and decided to ignore boring paperwork.  In essence, I dealt with struggle and found success in spite of what I had an inkling of my whole life and know for sure now.  Now, as my life continues to grow and become ever more complicated, trying to find more approaches seems to be valuable, and I want to try medication NOW, and not when I'm trying to develop scaffolds in learning at a prime time of growth.    Anyway, I figured this was as good of place as any to get some feedback from other thoughtful people.  I'm just curious to know what you all think - if you were a late diagnosis, do you think the struggle was worth it?  If you were diagnosed early and pursued medication first, are you satisfied with that?  Thanks in advance for you thoughts!  TL;DR - Glad I wasn't diagnosed until 30 because I had to work through my problems and dealt with my shortcomings square on.  DAE think that's a good strategy for people under 30?

Still figuring out medication and the like, but so far things are going pretty well on that front. However, though medication is helping, it's not fixing everything.   The biggest problem is insomnia. Most nights without any sleep aids I take anywhere from 3 to 8 hours to fall asleep. Sometimes I simply don't sleep until the middle of the next day. I will reset my sleep schedule for a while, only to find it quickly spiraling back out of control. So I can't realistically take any morning classes.   I'm still trying to find some sleeping medication that works; Ambien and Lunesta might as well have been placebos for all the good they did. I just started Vistaril, we'll see if that does anything for me. I've tried lots of the non-drug treatments as well; meditation helps some, but is difficult and doesn't do all that much.  To cut to the chase, though, my question is this: Are there any pre-med, current med students, residents, doctors, or students in comparable programs who have ADHD and have any tips for me? Is it even realistic to want to go to med school with ADHD? It already caused me to fail out of undergrad once, and I'm still recovering from that; I'm terrified of failing again, especially in such a high-visibility and high-stakes kind of place.   I know being able to be awake in the morning would be necessary, so I'm not going to even apply until I have figured out the insomnia at least a little. But there's other stuff I can see being a problem, and studying that amount of material for that long seems like an enormous challenge even for someone without ADHD.  EDIT: I just started on Vyvanse 60mg, have taken Ritalin and Strattera in the past (but not simultaneously, obviously). The Vistaril is up to four 25mg capsules, taken at bedtime.   **TL;DR:** Med student hopeful with ADHD including major insomnia. Is med school realistic, even possible? Any helpful anecdotes, tips, experiences, etc.?

dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Do I have ADHD, or is it just anxiety?;;;So, I know that I have anxiety, and this could just be restlessness from the anxiety, though, I'm not quite sure. And yeah, I know that you can't diagnose people effectively over the internet, but I'd appreciate some feedback.   I feel restless way too often. I feel like I need to constantly check for updates on YouTube, Reddit, Facebook etc. This can be really frustrating when I just want to watch a movie, or a video on YouTube.    When I attempt to learn something new on guitar, or the piano, I spend about 30-50 minutes before I just have to stop. I don't know why, but I have extreme difficulties learning pieces, even though I'm pretty good at actually playing the instruments. It's like learning the piece takes away the magic - it becomes boring, and I lose my will to learn it.  When I sit in class, attempting math, my brain just clocks out after about 10-15 minutes, and I just sit trough the entire class restless.   Now, this might not sound like it's too bad, but it's plaguing me every day, the restlessness, the compulsion to check for updates. You should see me when I order something I really want online.   Now, I'm not spontaneous in the least. I'm calm and logical, I don't get easily exited. I can spend hours doing stuff I'm interested in. I also know that I have anxiety, and depression. I've seen a therapist about that for about 8 months in the past.   Hopefully my post isn't completely ignorant about what ADHD is. Or ADD.

Next thing I know, he has his OWN prescription, an ADHD diagnosis, and is pulling all-nighters fueled by adderall.

Let's get this done!;;;Kick-Start Sunday is where all of us here at /r/adhd share the goals, tasks, or habits we want to accomplish this week.  You will be held gently accountable (which is a good thing!) and we can check in with you...helping YOU get things done.  *I suggest you read the whole post to be MORE successful, so put in the little extra initial effort and continue reading....*  ***  ## Choose the participation method that works for you:  * **Most important task** - Share one (or a couple) **HIGH-PRIORITY** tasks that you really would like to finally finish.  *(Ex. Set a doctors appointment, finish assignment, clean the kitchen...whatever YOU think is most important.)* * **Make a list** - Post a list of all the things you want to accomplish this week.  *(I highly recommend identifying the top 3 priorities.)* * **Feed your soul** - Sometimes by relaxing and having fun we have more energy to get more done. **List a couple FUN items to make your list more exciting.**  **Need/Want to copy last week's list *verbatim*?  Absolutely DO SO!**  *Those might be your keystone habits. Once you start doing those regularly you are able to do more. soon they will be automatic and you can put your focus elsewhere.*  ***  By sharing our goal(s) with this understanding community, we can keep each other **accountable**...and **celebrate our successes**, large or small!  **Don’t forget to return for [Win Wedenesday] to flaunt your successes!**  ;-)  By getting one small task done it creates **momentum**, **trust** in yourself, **confidence**, and you will feel like doing more.  ***  ## Suggested Guidelines  * **Prioritize your list.** One thing you want to get done (or start). What is the most important thing for you? (If making a list works best for you feel free to do that too!) * **Add a finish OR start deadline.** By committing to a date/time, we can check on your progress. * **Edit your comment when done.** - Come back and edit your comment when you have finished your goal. We can celebrate that (and then people won't check on you). * **Small start.** - Share what SMALL (under 10 minutes) commitment you can make towards your goal.  *I found when my clients didn’t reach their goals 90% of the time they never started...this will help you break through the initial barrier.*  ***  ## Tips  * Your tasks/goals should ideally be S.M.A.R.T goals: **Specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound** * **Measurable** - Make sure you can be able to say YES I DID THIS. **Study enough** is not measurable.  Study 2 hours is. * **Break it down** - Instead of saying clean my room...it might help to say, “Clean room for 10 minutes or pick up trash in room.” * **Write it down elsewhere** - Sticky note by computer.  Google calendar.  Agenda.  Write it down so you don't forget.  Our working memories are flaky.... * **Start small...build up slowly** - We want to build on small successes so committing to cleaning your entire house might be a bit too much to handle.  Pick a room (or a task like ‘pick up dirty laundry’)  instead. * **Want to study for 2 hours a day?** *Commit to studying 30 minutes to make it easier on you.*  ***  ## Examples from previous weeks:  * Tidy room. * Buy car. * Go to work. * Attend all my classes on time. * Reschedule appointment. * Mornings: brush teeth &amp; meditate.  Evenings: brush teeth, meditate, journal. * Pay bills. * Plan vacation. * Go to the gym 3x this week. * Break down chores by days so I can have 'a day off with my darling' before he leaves. * **Start** *[something]*. “Spend 5 minutes on writing my paper.”  ***  ## *It’s now easier to respond!  Just copy/paste the below into your comment.*  	## Daily Habit / Procrastinated Project / Soul-Feeding 	* **What?** - 	* **How much time?** - 	* **When?** - 	* **Potential Obstacles?** - 	* **Check in on me?

4fbafaa64456d3c82efbd788151a792efb87593fd2857f4f156beabc2fed5afa;;;Getting Medication?;;;I was diagnosed with ADHD back when I was in school. I have been off meds for quite an while. However, I am having trouble performing and focusing at work and at home, so I spoke with my doctor about ADHD meds.  He told me that I would need to speak with a psychiatrist in order to get a prescription for something like adderal. He then prescribed me welbutrin and said that it should help, since he thinks that I am depressed. I tried to tell him that if I am depressed it is because I cant focus due to ADHD. However I trusted his opinion and took the welbutrin. It has not helped.  Is this normal, and do most of you guys need to see a psychiatrist to get prescribed ADHD medication?
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;3 Weeks in on Adderall. Time to switch?;;;Background:Been using Adderall for about 2 months now. 30yo Male. Diagnosed first when i was about 8-9 and slapped on Ritalin. Didn't do much. Recently went and saw a psychiatrist after therapist recommended it. Diagnosed with inattentive type with a healthy dose of comorbid depression. Started me on 10mg IR in the morning, then after about a month moved me to 20mg IR in the morning and a 10mg IR in the afternoon. Side effects are still there, though not nearly as strong as they were initially. Problem I'm having is I still don't feel like anything has changed. I see all these other people talk about Adderall and the moment of clarity when they take it as life changing, yet I still haven't experienced it. So here I am two months later and am actually feeling even more depressed as I had such high hopes. Should I push my psych to up my dose? Will that make the side effects worse? Or should I ask to be switched to vyvanse?
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;ADHD meds affecting ADHD people differently;;;I am uncertain if I have ADHD, but that isn't really what this is about. I had the opportunity to try Ritalin(concerta) from a sympathetic friend. I know it makes everyone focus better, ADHD or not, but is it actually verifiable that it makes only(but not all) ADHD people calmer? Last time I took it, I dozed off for a few hours in my chair, and I felt more rested than ever before.   Stimulants help me to sleep, I take pseudoephedrine or ephedrine frequently to help my sleep. It lets me feel comfortable. As far as I have observed, the stronger the stimulant, the less social anxiety too.  It is a strange reaction. I have heard mixed opinions on whether this is significant at all. I know this isn't a way to diagnose someone, but I am wondering if this means I should legitimately pursue a diagnosis. Attention problems are only 2ndary to social anxiety, and I am afraid of SSRIs, so I am cautious of psychs, but if this indicates that the attention problems are primary, I would be willing to go and try to avoid SSRIs.  Just wondering how normal this stim reaction is in the non-adhd population.
2c1a81c2f42c1c25e0829f5c93896e5cc7f0f468c1916daf6bacba50411b92c7;;;Little positive outlook to my future. No more med options?;;;So I have tried Ritalin, Focalin, Vyvanse, D-amp, and Adderall, and nothing seems to work enough or gave me horrible side effects that caused me to stop taking it. I won't take Strattera because honestly that's the stupidest idea for ADHD medication and won't put that into my body.  I don't really know what to do at this point. I'm currently prescribed Adderall 20mg twice a day (Max I can be prescribed a day says my Dr) and its not doing enough. I currently take 25mg in the morning, another 5mg an hour later, then the last 10mg around 2 or 3 hours after my first dose. Thats about 40mg in less then a 4 hour period and it's not really doing too much for my executive functioning, focus, attention, etc. Also, for me personally which seems to be the ONLY person to have this issue, redosing past this 4 hour mark does NOTHING for me. Absolutely nothing in terms of my ADHD symptoms. I have tried 20mg at once, then waiting 4 hours and taking 20mg again and it does not extend the first dose nor bring me back up anywhere close to my first dose. I can't fathom how anyone else can take 2 doses (or more) a day with 4+ hours apart and say it works for them, let alone taking below 20mg a day and it working for them. Do they REALLY have ADHD? Am I alone in this situation?  I really have nothing left to try and don't really know what to do from here. I used to feel like Adderall was working enough to not complain about it even though it wasn't fixing everything (not that it should or could, but you know what i mean) but now I have little positive outlook on my future. Considering Adderall is no longer working how I need it to I guess i'm gonna see about switching back to D-amp because its cheaper until something gets figured out.  Anyone else in a similar situation or been there?   **TL;DR** I feel like I have these MAJOR Executive Functioning issues which no one else has had to deal with and medication isn't doing enough, but at the same time feel like maybe i'm just a "lazy useless piece of shit who can't do anything" and nothing can fix it. Either way, it's rather depressing to say the least.

I need advice!;;;I started ADHD medication in mid February.  I started off with 30mg of Vyvanse.  This worked well for about the first three days and then tapered off.    I was then upped to 50mg, which didn't work at all.  Then I was prescribed 60mg of Vyvanse, which worked wonderfully.  It only lasted for about 4-4.5 hours, so halfway through my day I was back to not being able to focus or remember simple things.  When I went back to the doctor, after 5 days of the 60mg, he just upped and switched me to Adderall XR.  I explained that the Vyvanse worked wonderfully, but it didn't last all day like I needed it to.    He said that because it wasn't lasting the 8-12 hours it is said to last that it wasn't the right medication for me.  I've been taking the Adderall XR 20mg for four days now and there is no effect.  None.  Zero.    My doctor and I already decided that because Welbutrin didn't work when I was misdiagnosed with Bi-Polar II years back that it wouldn't work now and so the same thing of Straterra.  So he took me off of Vyvanse, the Adderall doesn't work, Welbutrin and Straterra are out...  I told him I was frustrated because the Vyvanse worked great... just not all day.  Then he brought up another medication that he wants me to try, and that he wants me to think about it.  He said its brand new, but it needs to be taken for 2-4wks before it starts taking effect and then there may need to be dosage changes; that its a non-amphetamine medication.  I started having a meltdown because I can't go 2-4wks without medication - I can not function and its completely disruptive to my life.  He told me to just think about it, never said what it was, and handed me the scrip for Adderall XR 20mg.  Because the adderall isn't working, I'm terrified he's going to write me a prescription for the build up over 3wks medication.  I'm so upset.  I loved the vyvanse while it was working.  I was actually expecting to be given a prescription for an IR for later in the day, like I've known so many others to get.  I don't understand why he would take me off of something that worked.  I've never heard anyone say that Vyvanse lasted for 8-12 hours. I don't think there is a medication out there that if you take just one dose in the morning that its going to last 12 hours.     I'm angry and upset and confused.  Does anyone have any advice?  TL;DR - went through three different dosages of vyvanse - the third dosage, 60mg, worked great but only lasted for about 5 hours.  I got switched to Adderall XR and it doesn't work at all.  My doc told me about some new medication that is non-amphetamine and takes 2-4wks to build up in your system.  I'm terrifed thats what I'll get next and am upset because the Vyvanse worked.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Exam Issues: How do I respond? I'm failed three exams this semester, not because I don't know the material but because I cannot get what I know onto paper.;;;To give a little bit of context. I have two classes currently. One, I actually know all of the material I only took it to get an A. Two exams in this class have passed and I've gotten 50's on both. Part of it is I cannot convey what I know in a way that makes sense. I'm normally not one to blame professors, but part of this is his test wordings confuse me to the point that I cannot clearly convey my knowledge because I don't know what he wants. My exams have turned into trying to figure out what he wants, not what is the right answer. Yet, I'm still failing. I wrote a paper for this same class, it is worth 25% of our grade. I received a 98. I just do not get it. This plays into my other class as well    The other course is one I'm fairly knowledgable. First exam I basically failed (75). I went up to the professor and said, "So I got a 75...?" He said "Yes, this exam is not a reflection of your knowledge ." He knows I know the answers. He said I give him extra information that does connect, but I don't actually give him the whole answer.    In both classes I think the problems stem from I know **too much**. Here is the catch 22. My program (sans the first class) views grades as: You give the right answer, B. You give a good answer B+. An A is reserved for those who are exceptional students and display critical analysis in answering questions. This may be done by bringing in knowledge from course discussions or outside of the course. Both these exams are short answer. The first class I had the same professor last semester and our exams were multiple choice. I also did poorly, despite writing a paper for that course (got a 95). The way he words his questions I get confused and I can't think. I don't know what the answer might be and I over think it. I get the test back and I knew the answer (or accidentally marked it wrong).   I'm actually a senior graduating this semester. However, I was only officially diagnosed (again) last year. I wouldn't care too much about grades, but my GPA is awful. I want to go to vet school and every assignment counts. I work full time and have for 5 years, so that doesn't help. What strategies do you guys do? My professor in the 2nd class said I should spend less time studying material and study how to answer questions for his exam. The problem is if I do that I already know the answer. Our textbook doesn't have like "review questions" so that's not an option.  **TL;DR: I'm in several classes now where my ADHD is causing me to screw up. I know the answers, but have an extremely hard time interpreting and responding to both short answer and multiple choice questions. I'm not new at college, but I'm trying to focus even harder.**
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;How does getting a new prescription work?;;;So after what felt like a massive struggle, I managed to find a psychiatrist and schedule an appointment. Ended up being diagnosed with ADHD and was prescribed 50mg Vyvanse.   I have a 30 day supply and my follow up appointment was scheduled for a month later (30 days on the dot). I was afraid of having finals that week and being busy, but was told I could reschedule. Turns out I do have finals that week, and won't be able to make it to the appointment.  If I reschedule to an earlier date, will I still receive a refill for my prescription? Let's say my original appointment was on the 3/25 and I reschedule for 4/18 - will I receive another 30 day prescription or will I be told I have to wait, since I obviously still have 7 or so pills left.  Sorry if this is a stupid question. These past few days that I've been medicated have been amazing - I feel normal for the first time in my life. I actually have some self-worth and feel like I actually could be something in life, instead of feeling like a failure.   I remember all too well what my life was like pre-diagnosis and I'm terrified that I might have to back to that, even temporarily. So, if possible, I'd like to prevent a lapse in medication coverage. I've never been prescribed anything, so I don't know how it works. Thanks guys!

How did your day to day well-being and functionality differ from before?;;;So, I'm starting to suspect more and more that I may have ADD. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety around a year ago(might have been two) when I was 17 (or 16), and I thought that was the end of it. After therapy I got a lot better, and now I'm on Zoloft, keeps the lows away.   Also, how do I discuss this with a doctor? It took me thinking I was dying for a few weeks to actually get some help.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Care to share some success stories and maybe give a girl some hope here?;;;This is mainly just a rant post, so please don't even try to read it all of it except the TLdr, I just need to vent and get it all out somewhere and hopefully hear some success stories from you guys as motivation.  I'm 22 and only recently (as in maybe 4 months ago) was diagnosed with ADHD so I'm still in the experimental stage trying to figure out which medication will help.  I know this and I keep trying to remind myself that it will take time but I am starting to get so very discouraged with the whole process.  I've tried vyvanse, ritalin, strattera (good lord, the worst experience of my life), and now concerta.  So far vyvanse is the only thing that has helped but not only wore off within four hours but made me such a miserable irritable person to be around.    I'm in my last semester of college with an exam every day this week and next fall will start graduate school but I'm terrified I won't be able to handle grad school, since I feel like things have only gotten worse since my doctor and I have started experimenting with different medications.  I'm not giving up and I know it will all take time, I'm just starting to feel zero hope for this situation and don't have a great support system.    TL:dr- I'm not looking for a pity party, so if you feel like sharing your success stories please do...maybe it will give me a little more hope!

That ADD/ADHD results from our "instant gratification" society and a tendency to be inactive. So I believed this is the truth, because we do live in a society that pushes pills as a fix for most every problem. We do love instant gratification.  I am an undergraduate student, about the start my SEVENTH year as an  undergraduate. I was an art major because it was all I was good at, but didn't want to have to churn out uninspired works and hope to be paid for it. So I switched to something else, and then switched a few more times--all majors completely unrelated and requiring courses that did not pertain to other majors. So I am really far behind now in pursuing a chemistry degree with the hopes of going into nursing or maybe medical school if I get this all sorted out and can fix my course grade history.  I knew something was wrong (I have for a long time, but didn't know what to do) and so I looked up info on ADHD/ADD and found a video by a college-aged girl who talked about how she saw someone, got help, and now is doing very well at life. At all of the things I fail so miserably at and can't figure out why I do, because I WANT to be so good at them. Organization. Punctuality. Memory. You all know, I'm sure. So I saw in my city there was an ADHD specialist and now I am seeing him. I have accepted the condition is real, and am hoping that is what my issue is and that I'm not just a lazy person waiting for my breaks in life and hoping for reward with no effort on my part.  The main point of this was to say that I am so thankful to have found this sub. I teared up when I started reading through the posts... that there are people who struggle with the things that I do! A guy posted a picture of how he prepares for the morning so that he doesn't forget anything. Someone has the same problem as me and wants to help everyone who also struggles! That is just amazing. What a good human being. I am so thankful to have found you, r/ADHD!
876427e0e431952fa13d54fc9f7db2126e33bb349bfe0b0478fcf8cf95909e39;;;I've had ADHD for nearly 20 years, a majority of the time un-medicated.;;;Just wanted to share my story, and hopefully provide a perspective on what it's like for someone who doesn't, and hasn't, taken ADHD medication for most of their life.  I am 23. I was diagnosed with severe ADHD when I was 5, not sure what led up to the diagnosis, but I was swiftly prescribed Ritalin. This was in the 1994-1995 era, so ADHD diagnosis and treatment were fairly new/uncommon(from what I assume) and I was given a heavy dose. My parents were worried because when under the influence of ritalin I was practically a zombie, and would often had heart palpitations.   Over the next 8 years or so I began taking ritalin and aderrall on an inconsistent basis, due to both me spitting the pill out in the morning and my mom abusing them. I was pretty much completely off medicine by the time I was 12.   School, man.... I was always ALWAYS in trouble. I was pretty much always the first one in trouble during the day, taking frequent trips to the principals office. They must have been extremely understanding at my school, because despite the amount of time I spent in the office, I still passed every year. My dad ran the family, and he didn't understand ADHD very well. I would often be beaten for my antics at school. I grew up in a pretty abusive household, so not sure if this contributed to my problems or if it doesn't even matter. Anyways, I continued the same pattern of always in trouble, always running around, never being able to pay attention, never being able to commit, etc. until 11th grade.   During the summer of 11th grade going to 12th, I joined the Army and shipped to basic during what they call, Split-ops. I would do my basic during the summer, come back and finishing high school, then ship off to AIT and all that jazz fun stuff. I guess I matured pretty well during the summer, because during my senior year I was completely chill/calm and didn't get in trouble at all. I had a full time job after school and had a lot riding on me graduating and doing well. If I had to describe it, I'd say that my ADHD had turned into ADD. lol. I had pretty much assumed that I had outgrown my ADHD.  After graduating from High School I joined the active duty Army and was stationed in Hawaii. Life was normal. None of my symptoms were all that apparent during this time, for some reason, but now looking back I can spot them pretty easily. I deployed to Afghanistan in early 2011 and returned early 2012, followed by an Honorable discharge in late 2012. My last few months in the Army I started to notice my symptoms again. I had been diagnosed with PTSD, so when I started keeping a log and conscious thought of my thought process and mental health I began to notice very apparent ADHD symptoms. I made an appointment with a Psych to try and get some meds and was re-diagnosed with ADHD, called Adult ADHD in my case. The psychiatrist mentioned that I had a pretty severe case, constant fidgeting, poor memory/forgetfulness, among other things.  Now that I have been out of the Army for about 6 months I have been able to really focus on my problems and take care of them. I am able to set myself up for success and prevent a lot of the problems associated with ADHD by sticking with routines, lists, and the help of a wonderful girlfriend. I am still extremely horrible with money due to impulse purchases, but I am getting better. I still make lists for pretty much anything of importance, other wise I will forget them and they will not get done. And most importantly, I still have to set up everything the night before work so I won't forget anything, which still happens at least once a week. I have an appointment on the 22nd with a psychiatrist, so hopefully I can get some meds to help out a bit.  Anyways, just wanted to give my perspective.

I can compile the responses in this post and we can all have a chuckle at our absent-mindedness.  I'll start  1. See things that are theirs in places they shouldn't be (IE shoes on the stairs, hair ties on the ground in bathrooms, magazines on the floor in front of the house) and completely ignore them repeatedly every time they are passed. Often they don't get picked up until someone ELSE comes and says "Hey, this is yours, are you gonna take it?" and often your response is "Meh, just leave it over here." and continue to ignore it some more.  2. Forget to take your medication for ADHD repeatedly, or go through large spans of time where you forget to schedule appointments with your psych/therapist until you're either out of medicine or are going through a mini-crisis  3. Root for the wrong team at the sports event because you forgot which side of the field they are on and aren't paying attention to their jerseys.   4. Falling for a significant other quickly and on the other side of the spectrum, not having interest in romantic feelings for a long period of time  5. Not being able to empathize unless having a direct visual or auditory stimuli of the event, or on the other hand, not being unable to empathize with something which contradicts your own views/opinions/perception of the matter   6. While on OR off medication, craving substances/vices (IE Cigarettes, Weed, Coffee)  7. Not being able to maintain eye contact; finding it easier to talk to others when not looking at them  8. In social situations, having the tendency to blurt out your thoughts without regard to how they fit in the conversation  9. When having a conversation, jumping from topic to topic due to a train of thought when they don't seem to relate at all  10. A lack of drive to do things which are required but also perceived as "a waste of time"   11. Having lots of ideas very suddenly, obsessing over a new idea, only later to completely forget about it and not care anymore  12. Having a thought, but immediately forgetting what it was.   13. Writing Walls-o-text to get your point across but refusing to read other walls-o-text :P  14. Defiance of order and rules  15. Over analyzing EVERYTHING  16. Doing something quirky to snap someone out of their auto-pilot or to make others think  17. In the midst of not saying anything, blurting something out thats completely random. Other people look at you like, O.o  18. Having to re-read paragraphs multiple times due to skipping ahead/not really reading; having to read slowly and carefully to retain information  19. Mind wandering while reading/doing other things  20. Spending too much time in the bathroom, due to imagination  21. CANNOT for the love of god pay attention in class.   23. When they were younger/children, combat boredom by playing with normal items (ie, pencils, erasers, etc) and imagining a different situation; or just have a very vivid imagination that would make it difficult to pay attention   24. Blackout during a conversation; completely stop paying attention and zone out  25. Walk away in the middle of a conversation because you got distracted by something  26.

I'm 22, college student, been diagnosed for awhile. Recently I got back on my medication (36mg Concerta) and I've come to terms with something I've known for awhile. I'm addicted to the internet, more specifically Reddit and online tv/movie websites like netflix, hulu+ etc. and facebook...   Obviously this is having a negative affect on my life. When I'm not in class, I'm online... When I'm not hanging out with friends, I'm online... When I'm watching TV... Well you get the picture. I'd estimate I spend 8+hrs/day everyday on the internet.   I know it's going to be hard, but I really want to change. As strange as it sounds, the internet is getting in the way of things I enjoy. I don't even play video games anymore, or go to the gym or read or spend time with friends as much as I would like to. If you guys have any suggestions, pointers, personal insight you would like to add that would be wonderful.   Now that I'm back on my medication, I feel like a new person, but I think this issue is still interfering with my personal life and productivity.
a311f6897443730308f21e882b33e97c3bf2b903ee6ee65bf8c6992df0dfebff;;;I just got arrested...;;;| I posted this in [r/Adderall](http://reddit.com/r/adderall/) too.  Hey everyone!This morning, i was getting out of my car in the school parking when two cops asked me to stay there.. I knew I was in trouble because I had Adderall in powder form, 1Xr 25mg and a 30mg XR...The male cop started by looking at my seats, he finally asked me why there was marijuana residue on them. I answered that I'm smoking sometimes... They then processed to a huge search everywhere in my car BAM! He found the powder and the wooden box I keep all my stuff inside. I told them that I had my prescription(little paper with your name and info,inside your meds bottle) but anyways, they are bringing me to the station where the interogatoire lasted for a good 45minutes. My presc. was for Adderall XR 20mg only, but I had a 25 and a 30 that a good friend gave me last week...  The officer asked a lot of question about my friend and how it could be consider as illegal substance traffic.I told her that we both have a prescription for Adderall and she asked for his name but I didn't told her because I don't want him to have trouble with this.I was polite and using a profesionnal language when I was talking about Adderall all the time of the interogatoire. She finally told me it was over! I asked her if she could lift me back to my school and she did! :) Back at school I had to meet the direction to explain what happens because they knew I had been arrested, like everyone in the school --  *I'm posting this only for prevention because I don't want any of you to get in trouble because of a similar situation. I was lucky that the prescription was in my car(I had the idea to keep one in my car YESTERDAY!!) because it is illegal and ,where I live(Quebec, Canada), is on the same level as Cocaine.  So,please everyone ALWAY HAVE A PROOF THAT IT IS A PRESCRIPTION WITH YOU(in your pocket...)WHEN YOU HAVE ADDERALL ON YOU!... but it is only an advice!  TL/DR: Got arrested with Addy powder and some pills in the parking of my school when getting out of my car. Thet took me to the Police Station, where I was freak! I had a prescription for it but some were given by a good friend. They finally released me and I ahd to explain everything to everybody at school! I'm also giving a good advice up there that could save a lot of problem.
6f7af82b15ee0dab160ae51f882cc91858e2b4f81db9a9ccbf442f9cc36bf906;;;Pointed this out today.;;;The topic of ADHD came up, and the guy said he thought it was bullshit lazy people claim. I asked him what his stance was on abortion and he said he wouldn't go into it because he didn't have a vagina. I just asked him to think about that for a bit..  Edit: I didn't expect this to go anywhere, so I suppose I should clarify more as to why it really pissed me off.  I was kicked out of university a year ago for poor academic progress. The last year I was at the university, I was getting help through the campus medical center in the form of Ritalin. That did help a lot, but I still did not have the organizational skills I needed to do well. Then after I was dropped, since I was no longer at the university, I could not get access to any medication and I did not have good experience with the doctors outside of campus, so I decided to go without. So I have spent the last year and a half now working hard to get good grades and turn myself into a better organized man at a community college. I need to get good enough grades at a lower level institution to get back into the university.  So after all this work, I am now at the end of my semester and I have at least two A's and two B's.  That isn't perfect obviously, but it was my best semester yet in 5 years of trying.  When I was at the university and first got diagnosed, I thought I may have just been lazy. This last year however, I have been eating healthier, exercising, sleeping full nights and on a regular schedule, and more importantly going to class every day and doing all the homework. All that and I still have trouble staying focused, remembering things, going too fast, etc..

I've been diagnosed with ADD (or ADHD-PI), but I've been trying to find out if I have something else like a learning disability dealing with how I hear things. I don't know if I can find a doctor who can test me for auditory processing disorder, it doesn't seem to be very common.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;So I got to send this email out to all my professors this week. That was depressing... Hoping for the best though. Any similar experiences? (Sorry for the length);;;**TL;DR: Me laying out the problems I've been having since I started college that are causing me to miss class and perform poorly overall. My ambition was always high, but my motivation was nonexistent, and I didn't know why. Saw a doctor who diagnosed me with ADHD-PI and prescribed me medication. It helps, but it doesn't fix everything. I'm requesting a medical withdrawal from the semester to wipe my horrible grades, seeing a psychologist throughout the summer to work on my problems, then coming back next semester.**  Professor [Name],  I wanted to address my absence and missed assignments as of late. Please do not think I have simply been lazy or unmotivated, that is not the case. Normally I don't like to bring up personal/medical issues, but I felt it was only fair to both you and myself to fill you in on my lack of participation. I apologize for the length, but I want to provide as much information as necessary here.  I'll provide some back story first. Since I started college in 2010 as a Computer Systems Engineer student, I've been having a great deal of trouble acclimating to the new environment and the responsibilities it requires. I ended my first semester in decent standing, but not without a great deal of struggle and overall stress. More so, it seemed, than most of my peers. I chalked this up to laziness and a lack of motivation.  I switched my major to Digital Culture after freshman year hoping things would change, but unfortunately they only got worse. In school, I was having trouble motivating myself to go to class, finish assignments, and perform well in general. When I did manage to go to class or work on an assignment, it was extremely difficult to pay attention. I could not focus for more than 10-15 minutes at a time before my mind was distracted by something else. I would then become anxious and restless, unable to focus on the important content. This was happening inside and outside the classroom (homework, projects, studying, reading, at work, etc.). I think the best way to describe it is this: Imagine sitting in front of a wall of TVs all at high volume, and trying to focus on just one of them. You might get bits and pieces of what it's saying, but it takes a lot of energy and concentration to do so. And before long, another TV will grab your attention and pull you away from the important one. That is what my mind is like, 24/7. However, I didn't know this wasn't normal.  I was getting very frustrated with myself and became very self-critical, so I began making lifestyle changes. I tried to eat better, adopt a better sleep schedule, tried to develop a better daily routine, and so on. But these didn't seem to have any significant effect. I was still having the same issues as before, and they were getting worse. By the end of sophomore year, I had become depressed. My grades were spiraling downwards, despite my ambition and desire to do well in school. No matter what I did and how hard I tried, my performance level continued to drop.  By December of 2012, I became fed up so I went to the doctor and explained my issues. I told him about my inability to motivate myself, inability to focus, sleep issues, bouts of depression, and feelings of anxiety/restlessness. After a series of questions, he said he was certain I have ADHD-PI, or Primary Inattentive. I had never considered ADHD as a possibility, and the diagnoses frightened me. I went home and researched the symptoms. After going through nearly every list of symptoms I could find, I realized that I have every single one at a considerable level, and have had them since I was young (ADHD is also hereditary, and my mother had it as a kid). All of the issues I'd been having started to make sense.  It explained my trouble in school. Through researching, I learned that ADHD is a neurological disorder that causes a neurotransmitter imbalance and low dopamine levels in the brain. I learned two important details about ADHD. The first was that it inhibits self-motivation, leaving a person to rely solely on external motivation. For me, the motivation to finish a task is not based on my ambition to do so (however high it may be), but instead on the consequences for not doing so.  The second was that ADHD causes a warped perception of time. Differences in time don't register correctly. Personally, I noticed that my perception of time past ~48 hours in the future is basically a fog. Radio static. I can't understand it, let alone organize within it. Two weeks, two months, and two years all feel the same, despite my knowing they're not.  These two symptoms (time and motivation), make planning, organizing, and preparing for the future nearly impossible. For tests and long-term projects, for example, the inability to "see" past the very near future means I don't see the consequences until they are staring me in the face, and those consequences are the source of my motivation. On a two week project, the thought of finishing didn't register until I realized the consequences were about to happen. Then I'd start. It might seem like I simply procrastinate too much, but I believe procrastination is a choice, while this is not. I want to finish early, I want to study for tests, I want to avoid all-nighters, but I can't. The connection isn't there.  In order to help with these issues, my doctor prescribed me medication. It has helped considerably in some areas, but not all. Medication doesn't fix the symptoms, nor does it get rid of the bad habits and routines developed over the years. To work on those, I've started seeing a psychologist, who believes I may also have some form of anxiety disorder.  At this point, and with the support of my advisor, doctor, and psychologist, I've decided to try and take a medical withdrawal from the semester. I'm still in the process of filling out paperwork and will submit my request in the next few days. This semester was particularly difficult for me, and my grades and mental state have suffered. My stress levels are at an all-time high and feelings of depression are worsening. I believe a break from school and a wipe of this semester's grades are necessary. I plan on working with him throughout the summer and coming back next semester.  I hope this clears things up. Again, I don't want you to think I've just become lazy or unmotivated. This issue has gotten to the point where if I don't take a step back and get some help, I'll likely fail out of college.  Thank you and I apologize for any trouble I've caused. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask."
a96e60a5fea0d306d8dd9d69e01baa636cf3ae91d4cc5359606415ee25fdda75;;;Been medicated for two months, nothing has changed.;;;Hi /r/ADHD, I am a 21 year old male from Australia. I was diagnosed with ADHD (PI) at the beginning of this year and was prescribed Ritalin 10mg of which I took two pills a day. This apparently improved my mood and made me a much better person in general, but it did not help me with my procrastination and focus issues.     I decided to try dexamphetamine (5mg) because my psych said if Ritalin doesn't work then the dexies will. So I've been taking my maximum 4 pills a day, but I am not noticing any effect at all.   I am still failing all my classes and I have no motivation, no focus and I procrastinate with EVERYTHING that doesn't involve food, tv or the internet. Even writing this right now is me avoiding my assignment.      I know the medication isn't going to fix all my issues and I have to eventually just man up and deal with them, but I still feel that the medication should at least be doing something and making it somewhat easier for me, which hasn't happened.       I even tried going to a psychologist for some counseling, but she didn't want to talk about the ADD and just gave contradictory advice several times through the session. My Psychiatrist is difficult to get a hold of and isn't of much help anyway besides being a human drug dispenser.       None of my friends or family have any experience with ADD so I don't know who else to talk to. Should I go back to Ritalin and up my dosage? There are no other drug options available in Australia. What else can I do?    **TL;DR** tried both medications available in Australia, neither seem to be helping. Psychologist unhelpful. Psychiatrist unhelpful. What can I do?  **EDIT:** Thanks for your advice everyone who replied. I think your comments have helped me realise which things I need to work on to get back on track.  * Find the right dosage of Ritalin * Fix sleeping pattern * Work on the bad behaviours I've learnt over the years. * Limit access to things which distract me so much.
b973ea72a4dfc9e77b1ba4577f778425e47bb987e1da65fe302ec57158ab85a6;;;ADHD/Trigeminal Neuralgia/Surgeries/Master's Program.......sigh;;;So life is starting to get pretty annoying in the past year.  And I just need to vent and ask if anyone has advice on what I could do to help my situation.  WARNING: LONG :( Sorry!  Ok so when I was in undergrad I started to have a headache 24/7/365 that put me in the hospital multiple times.  People started to think I was crazy, or organ failure, or brain cancer, etc. etc.  I was taken off my ADHD meds (Dexedrine XR 10mg daily). And between the ADHD running rampant and the fact i wanted to shoot myself because of the pain my grades plummeted and I would never be able to get into Med school with my GPA.  It took 12 doctors and 2 years to diagnose my Neuralgia.  Was on every pain killer known to man, Percs/fioricets/methadone/fentanyl, and even having botox shots.  I became addicted to pain killers and had to go through a 2 week self rehab of no pain killers at all which made me sicker than I've ever been in my life. Also I became an alcoholic pretty quickly from self medicating since the pain was unbearable...which led to other issues I wont mention here. So my life's plan went down the toilet pretty quickly.  However, I graduated.  Fast forward a couple years because the economy sucks and I couldn't find a fulltime job.  So i get my job and realize after a few months I don't want to do it anymore because there is no room for growth in my home state.  (I can't leave my family area for fear of what would happen with me truly on my own).  I get a 12 cent raise after a year and live in a pretty expensive area to live in and don't want to leave my town (I live with parents currently).  So I can't afford a house even with making 40k a year.  So i decide I want to find a new job.  Enter problem 2:  I broke my collar bone a long time ago and it apparently never set.  So I had to have surgery to take bone out of my hip and place it in my collar bone and have a metal plate over it.  So that happens I spend about 5k after insurance costs for it and of course it doesn't work so I need a second surgery.  I have my second surgery and I've been out of work for almost 5 months now because my job wont let me back on light duty.  My long term disability got denied on a technicality, so I am destroying my savings account that i was building up for buying my house.  Zero income, 3k more in hospital bills, car insurance for whatever reason went up 800 bucks a year.  I bought a new car in 2011 for 26k so my savings is taking a beating but i had a lot in there so I am still ok for now.  But I now decide I need to further my education to get a job that I can afford a house on.  So I go back on my dexedrine XR (Which of course i can't get refills on and have no way of getting to my doctor before or after work to pick up a new prescription because they open after i leave for work and close before i get home from work [for when i actually get back to work]) So I need to find a way to get my prescription now after I get back to work.  But the master's program is about 40k and is a master's in Health Administration because I want to run the ethics/compliance department in a hospital.  I hate relying on other people for financial support but I'll have to with my mother.  I just am getting completely fed up with everything happening at once.  Especially the surgeries, they basically pushed me over the edge of pissed at life because I have zero income and am bleeding over 1000 a month from my savings.  The ADHD and trigeminal neuralgia just are adding to my stress since I am always in pain and always have my ADHD symptoms even if they are lessened on Dexedrine.  Does anyone else have a remotely similar story and how they got past all of the crap or any suggestions for what I could do to make things easier?  No i wont go to a therapist because I can't afford it currently even after insurance costs as I need my savings for car/student loans/medical bills/insurance bills.   TL;DR: Life is getting extremely stressful in somewhat unique ways as trigeminal neuralgia adds a lot of stress and it isn't something younger people get often (i'm mid 20s).  Add in zero income due to medical technicality and trying to go back to school for a MS degree.  Need advice if possible.  Medications on: Neurontin 4000mg a day, Ranitidine 40mg a day, Dexedrine 10mg a day, Inderal 80mg a day, Phenegran as needed, Ativan as needed. (Sorry for medicine spelling mistakes)  Probably a very unique medicine setup for those here, just wanted to post it incase it gave any help on advice.  Sorry.

I was diagnosed with ADD back in 1990. I was eventually put on Ritalin, which I took through Jr High, High and some of University. It helped me a lot, though in the last few years, I did not take my medication consistently.   I've been married for 10 years and my wife knows of my history and ha made many comments over that time encouraging me to seek help.   Some of my symptoms have been:  - compulsive eating - inattentiveness  - lack of focus - depression - plus many more.  I have recently been given new responsibilities at work that require me to study, read...focus, etc. it has been a struggle. I think over the years, my ADD has held me back from other positions. I am a big man (375+) and this all started after I finished school and stopped medication.   My Dr. Was receptive to my issues and has started me on One daily dose of Concerta 36mg. I have questions for those of you with similar circumstances.  1. After 5 days, I don't think my dosage is high enough. I think it has had an impact, but I don't think it's lasting 12 hours and I'm not 100 sure how to tell how much it works. Biggest difference I notice is my handwriting, actually. What experiences have others had?  2. My Blue Cross has indicated that they will not cover Concerta after this script runs out. I've read on here a lot of others' experiences with the generic. Should I be worried about switching so soon? Should I go to my Doctor now and talk about that and a higher dose, or wait out the month? How can I articulate to him what change I need, if any?  3. Do any of you on Concerta drink coffee? I've stopped, for fear of an adverse affect.  Sorry for the long post, hope some take a few mins to read and respond without a tl;dr

I need some serious help -- maybe this is my ADHD, maybe I'm just a shitty boyfriend.;;;I seem to always forget about my girlfriend. Last night we went to see Bassnectar. We had shitty tickets but a friend got us on the floor and we were so excited. I haven't seen her that excited in months. It was going to be awesome. I had kind of walked off in front of her a bit a few other times in the night and she kept asking me not to.   When he came on, the bass was so loud that it hurt our ears. We learned they had free ear plugs so we went and got some. Absentmindedly, I ran back into the crowd, thinking she was right behind me. Turns out she wanted to stop and put them in before going back into the room. She ran up to me and yelled at me for running away, and then started walking away from where we were. I followed her to figure out what was wrong.  For some reason, it never occurred to me to ask her if she was ready to go back in. It never occurred to me that she has crowd anxiety and doesn't like being left alone. We went to a festival last year and we had agreed that she would walk in front at shows because it made her a lot more comfortable that I was right behind her. This totally slipped my mind.  It ruined the night. She's still very upset that I always seem to forget about her or not ask how she's doing, etc. in most situations. It's not that I don't care. I care very, very much and I love her more than I ever thought possible. We have recently moved in together, but it seems like the only times we are really good is when we're alone at home. Whenever we go out, I always seem to piss her off in some way. When we're home alone, we are absolutely fantastic.  I want to be a better boyfriend so badly. She deserves it, I'm just becoming increasingly afraid that I can't provide it for her. I don't know why, but i just seem to always forget about her. How can I make this up to her? How can I force myself to learn to be more considerate of her and her needs. I've recently been prescribed 20mg XR Adderall, but I think the dose might need to be increased. It helps a little bit, but not enough. I am willing to do anything for this girl, I just SUCK at being a boyfriend.

Something I have been noticing in my self more and more is my tendency to get all stuck up in my own head., worrying about shit which probably isn't true, or isn't going to happen.
4938c9fad7e164a300f1ef6e8a150cc20b22c9830f59a0e2b7229c90eff4f4d2;;;Problems with jackassery while on meds. Ideas?;;;Hey all. It's been forcibly brought to my attention that I am an utter asshole while using my prescribed dose of adderall (10mg IR.) In particular:  - Less patient with errors in others - Quicker to more intense anger - More likely to talk over someone else - More likely to have entire conversations with myself with another person in the conversation, bringing up and addressing points and predicted counterarguments without allowing them to interject  For the time being, I'm going to try restricting caffeine while also using adderall, and attempt better self-control, ie using the increased energy to examine a proposed sentence before actually speaking it. Does anyone else have ideas or techniques that have worked for them? Thanks in advance.  Edit: my diagnosis is -PI; I've brought up the possibility of SCT but neither doc nor pdoc are interested in anything not in the current DSM.

(I felt so terrible I asked my parents for them and could never manage to get past the first few chapters)...   Any books I did read I can never recall things from them, like I mean I'll only every remember one or two main things about the book, but the rest I feel like i just zone out and continue to read without actually absorbing..  I waste a lot of time on my own, and in my free time, so I want to better myself and I feel like reading more can really help me in some aspects of my life, especially since I've been studying engineering for the past 3 years and my connection to literature is pretty much non existent now.   Anyone have ideas of popular books I could read that might get me into books more? I have a taste for many things so I'm open to any suggestions.
4d76fb32371e48be995d07d8334e3273756e8aeee528dcd0a215328c8e8f91d6;;;I know this is a common problem..but my social life is stupid.;;;I feel like most of us ADD/ADHD'ers have this issue with our social lives. It just doesn't make any sense. I will reach out to people, and often times I get nothing...literally nothing. I will make an effort to be friends with someone and they don't seem to reciprocate. I thought people wanted to be social? I am an awesome fucking dude, yet joe shmoe over there who is ten times the loser I am gets more fucking attention than I do. Not to mention girls actually talk to him, and don't ignore him as if he doesn't exist.  You know what I think it is? COMMUNICATION! Having ADD for me is bad enough but I am able to communicate properly and let people know the real fucking deal so they know what I am thinking and feeling without any retarded assumptions. I consider myself a good communicator and I think normal people with their stupid filters and shit don't know how to communicate. They do, but they don't socialize the way we do in which both silence, and talking is golden. As long as time is spent well and together with others.   I hate how normal people assume things. They assume that you are this, or that, when in reality they don't even fucking know you well enough. I just grinds my gears and humans are social creatures so having a good social life is intrinsic and healthy for human kind. Also people rarely invite me to things. It is like they forget about my existence and it makes me feel like a worthless piece of shit.  Sorry this is kind of a rant but as a human who knows that social life is incredibly important, having ADD makes it that much worse. Now being friends with other ADD'ers is perfectly fine. In fact my relationships with these people are more healthy but it still does not change the fact that I feel so alone sometimes. And I hate it.   I just haven't had the social life I always wanted and god damnit I would do anything to have a healthy one. Does anyone feel the same as I do?
5849e77e9a84686af13c65da342391148a95b662fb1bee82e753eaf83c94ce8c;;;I feel like I wasn't always this way.;;;I'm 20, diagnosed, and currently not taking any meds. I've been reflecting a lot on my ADD lately, how it effects me, what symptoms I can attribute to it, and what I can do to improve myself. The more I think, and reflect, the more I realize that this has gotten progressively worse over time.  When I was young, like 7 I could pay attention to things for hours at a time non stop, I was able to dedicate hours to practicing and exploring things just for the sake of self improvement and curiosity, and other than some hyperactivity I was a normal, well-rounded kid who did normal kid things.   Now, I can't even sit through a tv show without realizing that my mind has wandered somewhere else and I haven't absorbed anything. In movies where I used to be able to immerse myself in the storyline and forget I was in a theatre, I now find myself wondering when they're going to be over, or how long I've been there, or whether or not my cat's ruined anything while I've been gone.  Tried to read a book, quit on page 3 after realizing that I got caught up reading 4 or 5 different lines for 2-3 minutes at a time, whereas 10 year old me was able to read complete novels in one sitting and follow the plot without distraction.   As I'm writing this I'm reminded that I can't even concentrate long enough to write a complete sentence without reading it over to make sure that I'm still on the same train of thought. When I was 12 I wrote 20+ poems and 5 short stories over the summer break.   Everything I've read about ADD/ADHD says you're either born with it, or you don't have it and never will. What the fuck is happening to me?!

I did maybe 10% of homework for highschool ( just could sit down and focus on it). I had severe social anxiety. A devastating self-confidence level, and much more.  I discovered a video "the great porn experiment" on youtube. Which led me to /nofap.  I read the posts there, and saw that it was severely increasing people's will-power, concentration, and self-confidence among many other things.  And after 1month of not masturbating I shit you not, my ADHD symptoms are basically non-existent. Better results then when I was on aderall.  Do yourself a MASSIVE favour and head over to /nofap.

I was diagnosed late in life while in college.  No medicines seemed to work.  They all gave me major headaches.  Enter Focalin XR.  I was able to concentrate so much better, I was less anxious because I could focus.  It took a 3 month battle for my insurance to OK the XR version, but it was totally worth it.  Now my doctor is taking me off of it.  I was having cardiac symptoms and the cardiologist does not think it's a good idea.  FML

Almost everything is done, all that's left are exams! I'm going to make it! A friend of mine gave me particularly good advice: "You don't have a choice." When I realized that, I just kept going.  My exams are in four days. I feel like I'm not going to be able to pull of my exam miracles of past and suddenly get a top grade without trying.   I have a CAS portfolio that I slacked off on for two years due tomorrow that I now have to make up.  I have to make my uni decision by Wednesday and that involves re-researching the college where I got accepted.   I need to update my FAFSA by hand because the IRS data retrieval tool refuses to function.  My emotions are totally out of wack lately. I get these rages that I have to keep in because screaming in public and flipping tables is not socially acceptable. I'm feeling more and more destructive and I need to express these urges. I threw eggs against a wall about an hour ago... it helped moderately.   My dad is hating me more and more as I struggle more and more with this stuff.  And to top it off I don't even know if I have ADHD because my family won't let me get diagnosed.  Did I mention my exams are in four days?  Ahhhhhhhh.  /rant

I have been struggling in all aspects of my life recently.  I'm in my third year of college, and have always been the kid that could easily get an A, but usually ends up with Bs because he's too disorganized.  I got a full academic scholarship to a state university, and the previous two years I've been costing just above the 3.0 required GPA to keep it.  I got extensions on multiple classes last semester, and spent an entire winter with literally nothing to do, trying to finish my papers but distracting myself instead.  Then this semester has been almost complete procrastination, to an absurd degree.  I will schedule time to do work, go to the library, and then spend hours being completely unproductive.  I feel like I can't concentrate on anything that isn't immediately rewarding and fun.  I often plan on going to do work at night and end up drinking, or playing games, or watching movies instead, no matter how urgent and important my responsibilities are.  I miss meetings, forget basic class supplies, lose everything, and I can't even seem to find enough time for friends.  I'm on probation and have missed my community service deadline twice.  I struggle with keeping track of money and find myself completely broke 5 days after getting my paycheck.  I don't even know where I'm going to live when the semester ends.  Most of the time, I have a stoic state of mind where I don't even let these overwhelming problems bother me.  I'm happy, and enjoying life, and am care-free.  But this kind of crushing weight is still always there, and when I actually think about everything I have to do, it's almost impossible to start anywhere.  I do not discuss any of this with anyone, except a counselor who I started seeing last week (after failing to attend a month of scheduled meetings.)   All of the online screenings for ADHD have told me that I likely have a condition, but I know these tests are not astoundingly accurate.  I've looked at places that do evaluations, but I don't know when I'll have enough for it, or if they're covered by insurance.  My little brother by 8 years was diagnosed with ADHD last year.  I guess I don't have a specific reason for posting this here, but it helps to just get it off my chest.  Any feedback would be very appreciated.  **tl;dr**I'm going through some shit, do I have ADD?

Anyone's input would be greatly appreciated, especially by me right now as I try not to freak out. Here's my piece:  It's going to be okay, and everything will get done, just breathe and organize your time like you know how to do. Don't stress too much about the big picture, just take each thing at a time and you'll get it all done. It's hard now but soon you will have turned everything in and taken all your tests, and then you can relax! Just keep going.
a0b8df1d8cd48fbffd971c7e678169e870e31e235ab6beec150f3d0cd5b423f7;;;Really need to get it out;;;I've finally been diagnosed with ADHD-PI this Jan after months of struggling in college. The diagnose helped to explain years of my behaviours and in a way a relief knowing what's wrong with me and the way I feel. I've been struggling years with emotional problems and it wasn't until recently that I had finally find a way to deal with it. I go to a very competitive school and for the first two years I did managed okay. When things started getting harder, I had no way to cope. I don't have the skills, I never study in my life, I didn't know what to do. I failed two courses in summer school, late withdrawal for all my last term classes. In Jan, I was diagnosed and prescribed with Concerta. For a while, it worked and then it stopped working. I was left feeling confused, tired and my thoughts only lasted for secs before they escaped. I was so mentally handicapped, sitting in front of my laptop, breaking down, desperately trying to write something. I started vayanse this week, so far it is working. But I didn't hang in one paper and didn't have time to write another one. Maybe I will fail my courses this term again. The struggle is really painful, you are always trying to play catch up. You fell, pick yourself up again and keep trying. I am so ashamed of my failure, I can't tell anyone. A lot of ADHDers are also struggling and it really helps a lot knowing that you are not alone.
55fd497d16a6133851b44ef4c026aa5834212ec98c1338e076470f109fc64d93;;;How do I hold your attention?;;;Reading so many posts about ADHDers thinking of their friends but not calling them. That people are boring to you. That you feel like an outsider.  As a non ADHD person, how do I keep your attention enough so that we can have an active friendship?      Edit: Okay - thank you everyone. My honest feedback is that:      * I've epically failed a new friend. I think I did every "do not" on your combined lists.  * I am incredibly intimidated by this list, and I will be really self-couscous if we ever hung out together again, trying to do/remember all these things.  * Some of these typical reactions, are the exact same signals used to drop a person from your social circle. For example, never calling. Short brief communications (texts). Disinterest in conversational topics. Not showing up.     So how do I tell the difference between someone with ADHD who is reacting normally, or if they are just not interested in being my friend? (because continuously reaching out in the wrong context would be pretty embarrassing)

Previously, before I was finally diagnosed and put on focalin, I had scored a horrible 45% on the first exam.   I love my major, Computer Science, but the attention to detail can be killer. I finally felt I was able to take these abstract concepts on paper and actually understand all the parts at once, instead of bits and pieces getting mixed up.  Anyway, I scored a 91.8% on that test Friday. I worried about passing this class and now I know I will be receiving at least a B. It excites me as to what I might accomplish next semester, when I can start the semester this way.

I have been getting depressed on Sundays, like really just lethargic, dull, unmotivated, and generally just down. He said it was from the Vyvanse leaving my system after taking it every day during the school week. Being 17, he told my parents and I that it is smart to take it everyday.... even SATURDAY and SUNDAY. Id rather not take stimulants on the weekend, to allow time for relaxation, (eating and sleeping) or just creative fun. My parents say that I have to listen to the doctor and take it everyday, but im proposing that i only skip Saturday, then take it Sunday to avoid the depression?? I DONT KNOW! ANY advice, experiences, facts, or things i should explain to my parents?   daydream on.

Someone help?;;;Hey, I'm in the process of being medicated for my concentration and what-not. I have ADD (but in the UK it's all just bundled up and just called ADHD now) and my psych. gave me some leaflets about what medicines i should choose. I've been researching quite a bit, but all the fancy names and numerous medications I can take are overwhelming.   I am not going to take medication that requires me to take it at a set time every single day for the rest of my life since my short term memory is as good as nothing. And I have a horrible phobia of nausea so if nausea is common on these medications i will flat out refuse to take it.  I am a teenage girl and I have aspergers as well, so I don't know if my medicine will clash with that?  But all I need the medicine for is to concentrate on school work as I'm going to be home tutored.   All I want is someone to guide me in the right direction. Please just give me a quick summary of what medicine **you** take and if it's good for concentration and tell me what symptoms you have (if there is any), I've read the medication FAQ, but that kinda confused me even further. So many fancy names.  Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask lol

The first problem I have is that Vyvase doesn't last long for me.  I am on Vyvanse 70mg (was on 50mg for 1 month but I complained about it not lasting very long).        The major issue i have is that I have started having really bad tics. I've had some tics all my life (I blink a lot and often it's extremely uncontrollable.) I've been having wrist tics (I get the uncontrollable urge to pop my wrist or flick my pinky) for around 7 years. The wrist tics come and go and sometimes stops for months/years at a time.       The tics have been pretty steady the past 4 weeks and I started looking into it and appearantly ADHD and Tourettes are often co-morbid conditions. I mentioned the tics to my Dr. and I mentioned Intuniv that can be taken with a stimulant to treat adhd and reduce tics. I've been on intuniv for 4 days and I've had mixed results. For the first 3 days my tics seemed to ease up. Today my tics were on overdrive.  I'm due back for 2wk checkup (to see how my 2wk intuniv trial is going) in like 8 days and im not sure what to do. I am thinking about asking for Strattera.  Does anyone else have add and tics or tourettes and how do you deal with it and what treatment do you get?  TL:DR- ADHD +tourretes/tics. I have issues with it, do you and if so what do you do about it?

I'm concerned, though, that I won't be taken seriously because I have no visible "problems" in my life. I'm a freshman in college and have never had any problems with grades - I was a valedictorian in HS and received some nice scholarships to a state school. But in reality, I just went to a really poor high school (one of the worst 15 schools in my state), so HS was not a challenge, and now that I'm in college, I'm really struggling to keep up.  While I seem to be doing okay on the surface, I always feel like I am living on the margin of failure. I constantly procrastinate and, when I do set down to work, I get distracted by anything. In high school, I just didn't have many responsibilities, so pulling an all-nighter now and then wasn't a big deal. But now, I have a constantly heavy workload that only gets worse around midterms/finals. I will make a schedule for the day and write out when I am going to work on what - and then follow it. But I just cannot seem to be productive unless I am doing things at the last minute. I will go to the library for, say, three hours to study, but get hardly anything done. Eliminating distractions - leaving my phone and computer behind, etc. - helps somewhat, but I'll still manage to get distracted - "What's that word mean? Better look it up." Then I will realize that I have spent the last twenty minutes reading about the etymology of the word and how it came to be used today and so on. . . As a result, I'm always stressed about everything, and even the prospect of something as simple as reading a novel is stressful because I know that I will get distracted and that it will take me much much longer than it needs to. Also, I have a huge problem following verbal instructions or directions - I am always getting lost, whether while driving or trying to follow directions, and I always have to ask for repeats. Again, this wasn't a big problem in high school, but now I'm expected to act like an adult and, no matter how hard I try, I hardly ever can.  I am managing to do alright. I finish assignments, I do readings, etc., and I do well in my classes. But everything takes me so much longer than it ought to, and I cannot help it. My health - physical and social - suffers because I have to budget so much time for things that shouldn't take very long. And everyone thinks I'm "smart", but I can't follow simple directions (which really shows in lab classes). Now, I have an appointment with a doctor to talk about my problems, and I'm worried that he will think that I'm just some lazy college student trying to get some pills. Should this be a concern? If so, what should I do to be taken seriously?  TL;DR: I do well in my classes but am constantly distracted, procrastinating, and stressed, and I am worried that I won't be taken seriously by a doctor because I'm not visibly struggling.

Best medicines, helpful habits, coping strategies etc.;;;I am going to have an appointment with a psychiatrist to figure out a good treatment for my diagnosis. The thing is this is the very first appointment of ADHD treatment for me and I have no idea how I will react to each medicine. Do any of you fellow ADHDers have a suggestion as to which medicine I should try first? Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse? This might be a silly question because it might be my medical professional making the decision for me. Also any tips for a 21 year old male newly and officially diagnosed would be appreciated.  Edit: First time poster!
d543fbdf713cd09ba869d794f5af69184a3319d50c2b7c51ae075932c709988f;;;My doctor and I had an interesting discussion about ADHD and breakups this month;;;First time posting, sorry if this has been brought up.  So I recently broke up with my SO.  Well, recently as in back in January/February, but it still feels pretty recent.  I ended up telling my doctor at our routine visit, and how I felt kind of...  weird that I didn't feel sad about it, other than maybe on one or two occasions.  Unrelated to ADHD, the details are that my SO basically never wanted to spend time, but I always did.  We had different drives, too, but basically while we had much in common, he just never really wanted to be around me.  So I guess I got "used" to him not wanting to spend time, until out of the blue (to me) he suddenly did, and I felt enough was enough - I didn't want to play this game of "Will he want to spend time?  What do I need to do to get his attention?  Am I just not good enough?" (this is already bad for someone who has self esteem issues).  Well, long story short, this is after I'd been on a steady dose of Concerta for 2-3 months (previously, I'd only taken it every couple of days, so I never felt the "full" effects, apparently).  The issues in the relationship had been ongoing for years at this point - so my doctor found it FASCINATING that I chose NOW to end the relationship (well, a few months ago).  According to him, it's not unheard of for an ADHD person to just suddenly end things when they are receiving proper treatment - it's almost like you "forget" that you're miserable, or start focusing on something else, and that the breakup kind of falls under "getting things done" (in a sense).  Anyway, what brought on this post is a thought today - I realized I don't tend to have too much trouble moving on from relationships, even ones that lasted years.  I'm wondering if this is unusual...  Because I'm wondering if its similar to the focusing thing my doctor mentioned?  On the other hand, I WAS "used" to not having my SO nearby, so I guess moving on from that isn't too difficult.  Tl:Dr: Doctor said that it's not unusual for an ADHD person to end a crappy relationship shortly after receiving proper treatment.  Also, DAE find themselves moving on pretty quickly?

Presently I only use it when I anticipate a task which requires a large amount of concentration. When I use it I do notice substantial increases to my ability to concentrate on my tasks. But often I have problems with the side-effects: most notably an increased heart rate, which makes me feel anxious, and a reduced appetite, which Im not too bothered by, as well as a dry throat.   I have been looking online about the symptoms and side-effects of ritalin/adderall use amongst both normal people and people suffering from ADHD. I was asking myself that if it helped me concentrate, why not normal people? Apparently, many students do think this as well. But then the articles go on to say that the effects can be harmful, most notably leading to heart problems.   Then I'm thinking, why do ADD users get this drug prescribed on such a massive scale if it is known to lead to heart problems? Articles on other similar drugs say that this type of drugs (Amfetamines) improve performance, but at a costly price.    My question is really, as a sufferer of ADD, what is this price to me? Do I also have an increased chance of heart problems (Being an otherwise healthy person, you know: Balanced diet, regular exercise, etc)? Would it be better to look for alternative ways of dealing with my concentration problems and abandon medicinal treatment altogether?

My treatment has been positive but has had some let downs. The first problem I have is that Vyvase doesn't last long for me. I am on Vyvanse 70mg (was on 50mg for 1 month but I complained about it not lasting very long). The major issue i have is that I have started having really bad tics. I've had some tics all my life (I blink a lot and often it's extremely uncontrollable.) I've been having wrist tics (I get the uncontrollable urge to pop my wrist or flick my pinky) for around 7 years. The wrist tics come and go and sometimes stops for months/years at a time. The tics have been pretty steady the past 4 weeks and I started looking into it and appearantly ADHD and Tourettes are often co-morbid conditions. I mentioned the tics to my Dr. and I mentioned Intuniv that can be taken with a stimulant to treat adhd and reduce tics. I've been on intuniv for 4 days and I've had mixed results. For the first 3 days my tics seemed to ease up. Today my tics were on overdrive. I'm due back for 2wk checkup (to see how my 2wk intuniv trial is going) in like 8 days and im not sure what to do. I am thinking about asking for Strattera. Does anyone else have add and tics or tourettes and how do you deal with it and what treatment do you get? TL:DR- ADHD +tourretes/tics. I have issues with it, do you and if so what do you do about it?
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Libido going crazy since restarting adderall;;;So I used to take adderall for adhd, I stopped taking it for a few years, and got put back on adderall a little while ago.  Everything's been great and it's done a lot to help me with adhd, but it's caused my libido to skyrocket.  Before I'd masturbate 2-3 times a week now I probably average about five times that.  It's like adderall took the little distractions away but turned my libido into one enormous distraction.  I'm having to go to school to do all my work and studying because that's the only way i can actually get it done without opening up a new window, bringing up a bunch of porn sites, then spending the rest of the day treating my body like an amusement park.  It has driven me to spend time browsing hookup sites even though I've never done anything like that before and don't really want to get into something like that.  The magnitude of this problem became clear when I was looking at an ad on craigslist from a gay guy who wanted to give oral to a straight guy and I was thinking "hmmm... I could be getting my dick sucked within an hour..."  Thinking back to when I was taking adderall before, I probably had this issue then too but just didn't piece it together because I had been taking it for so long that it just seemed normal.  I don't really know what I want to hear from /r/adhd about it, but I feel like I can't talk to anyone else about it.  Has anyone else had this problem and found ways to deal with it?  I don't want to tell my doctor because I don't want him to consider taking me off of it.  It's been working great and this has been the only side effect that's been difficult.  I don't have a gf or fuckbuddy or whatever other arrangement might provide me with a third party to help take care of this problem and I'm also well past hormonal-teenager status so that's not it.
aff1907cc42d7058e0d156045292c1e5280f7ac568a7eeabb41fdd37de74c5fc;;;Just took adderall for the first time this morning. I want to talk about how I feel.;;;First off, I need to let you know that I'm very paranoid about my diagnosis. If it turns out to be false then I have no idea what my next step is, or how to go about solving my problems. But I also don't want the wrong diagnosis. I've had symptoms of ADHD in childhood, and now at the age of 23, but I'm still trying to be as skeptical as possible.   So currently I've been prescribed 20mgs of adderall but I've decided to take 10mgs for the frst day (which I guess isnt a lot), just for testers. I tend to be a high energy person with a lot of anxiety (I'm sure a lot of us are), so when I first felt the effects of the medication my mind started outright racing. Which lead me to believe maybe I don't have ADHD because I'm so wired! Which lead to more anxiety because I thought I had the wrong diagnosis, ect, ect. But I've calmed down now. I've been able to sit in one place for longer than usual. I started to clean my room (for what seemed like the first time ever), but I became distracted and got on reddit.   I can't tell if this is helping or not yet. Usually I look for 2 main things to go away when I'm on medications (I've taken straterra before with mixed results)  1. My mind doesn't race as much. 2. I stop grinding my teeth  Niether of those things stopped completely with adderall (they did with stratterra). Although I'm wondering if maybe I should have probably taken the entire dose before trying to come to conclusions. What I'm really wondering is:  1. My concentration level is only slightly better with 10mgs of adderall. I can't decide if my mind is racing more now, or before. Does that mean I should try more? Or is it possible I don't even have ADHD? 2. I feel "wired" in a sense, but I haven't moved from my seat. normal? 3. Does it take a few days to get used to the feeling of this medication?  Maybe I just had certain expectations about adderall that were false. I see people without an adhd diagnosis taking it in college who are very concentrated and studying hard when they take it. I still feel bouncy. and maybe a little anxious. But there definitely is a calm feeling somewhere in there too. It's so weird!   I don't know how to react!  **EDIT:** I think it's also helpful to know that I freak out when I ingest any type of medication. Regardless of what it is, OTC or otherwise.

Count.;;;One thing I haven't been able to control for years is preventing myself from spacing out in the shower (daydreaming, basically) and causing it to take much longer than it needs to.

Years of business travel spoiled me into using standing in a nice hot shower as 'me' time because it was an unlimited supply of 'free' hot hotel water….

e660a159029704b4044c6b0cb765992877002b323b8b15baa3a50d92dca5c96d;;;Introducing myself, along with a complex question;;;Hello r/ADHD,  I've been lurking around Reddit as well as this subreddit for a while and finally decided to make an account. Early into my time at college I started noticing some issues with getting work done in class and keeping up to pace with the general course-load. I'm an engineering student so I assumed there was a learning-curve to the whole college thing.  I began to try harder and harder each semester only to be rewarded with worse grades. This began to take it's toll on my mentally so I sought out help. Initially my family physician said it was General Anxiety Disorder (GAD), so I took the necessary non-medicated steps to alleviate my symptoms.  I fixed my sleep schedule, I changed my diet to be more healthy (although I am generally very healthy as is), I stopped any alcohol use, began to meditate (controlled breathing mostly), workout less often as I assumed I was burning myself out, and even tried to read more often to calm myself.  These generally improved my daily life, but as one with adhd would know it is not going to cure anything. I began seriously inquiring to my doctor about the possibility of ADHD, as my anxiety seemed to stem from school, and I was sent to months of evaluations from my university's counseling centers. After what felt like forever, I was diagnosed with mild ADHD due to inattentiveness and impulsiveness. I was then titrated up from 20mg of Vyvanse to 40mg which I am currently taking.  I do not take my medication every day, my Psychiatrist at school said it was okay not to, and she assured me my physical health and mental health would be okay.  I feel amazing while taking it. I feel motivated, I can actually accomplish tasks I set out to do. I've been more organized. I'm very intelligent, and I feel this really lets me tap into my true intellectual potential. I have really no complaints at all about how I feel.  Now my question... I am studying Biomedical Engineering as well as Psychology, so I've done a bit of studying on this on my own time and am pretty well versed on the subject. My understanding is that the main neurotransmitter being affected by the medication, is Dopamine, along with a bit of Nor-epinephrine. These control a wide variety of functions and systems within your brain, which can be seen as the boost in mental performance while on the medication. After quite some time of trying to find an answer with very hazy results, my question is this: Will taking this medication long-term create an inability to naturally produce these effects if taken off? I understand that my dopamine, and nor-epinephrine levels are elevated, and that's what leads to my ability to learn, remember, think, and basically every positive effect to be experienced. But, if I continue on the medication long enough, will my natural functioning of production change/cease and cause a psychological dependence?  Thank you for taking the time to read if you did read the whole thing.  TL;DR - Diagnosed with ADHD, taken natural steps to aid symptoms, along with 40mg Vyvanse, not daily. Will Vyvanse cause a psychological, not physical, dependence?

Basically, my friends and family are all very academic people, and my boyfriend, although very intelligent, has trouble following the thread when we have academic-based discussions. We're fine having these discussions on our own, but with other people, a big issue is that he never went to university, another might be that, due to his ADHD and/or other factors, he has trouble keeping up with our logic flow.  With friends, we don't have to go to the same parties all the time- I can have my friends and he can have his. I've come to see that's probably the best solution.  But with family... my mom just doesn't understand him. She says he doesn't "fit into our world," our world being comprised of, I suppose, very focused, academic sort of people. She thinks he's too "bouncy", etc. And he gets really quiet when we're having academic discussions... that's the crux of the issue for me. I don't care what she thinks about him bouncing off the walls, but I want us to be able to participate in higher level thinking discussions with my family, like we can do when it's just us. How have you dealt with this?
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Opinions on what I believe is a false negative result;;;It's actually a very very long story about why I decided to get tested and what I think was wrong with the people who administered the test and all the details in between, so I will save that for if someone specifically asks a question. So here is a very brief summary of my situation:  TL;DT I experimented with Adderall and found it to seemingly work miracles for me, specifically getting me an A in a troublesome class when I would've more than likely gotten a C. Decided to get officially tested. Despite results saying I was a near perfect fit for all the criteria of ADHD, my score was too high on the cognitive portion of the evaluation so they said there was no way I could have ADHD. Was instead diagnosed with anxiety and given an SSRI.  Is this common? I just don't understand why they refuse to say I have ADHD when I believe all the evidence points in that direction.

How ADHD fuels the anxiety and depression that cockblock my improvement.;;;A little background.  I am 28, diagnosed with ADHD 5 years ago and take a very proactive / self aware approach to my ADHD.  I work as a marking director in a mental health clinic so I am surrounded by support and information.   Depression / anxiety have generally been the presenting issues of my ADHD (as my job/life is ADHD appropriate).    I have been doing REALLY WELL lately when it comes to managing my ADHD.  I have kept a clean enough apartment that I can invite people over.  I am getting my work done, and remembering bills (for the most part).   The issue is that everytime I start to get to this point, the amount of energy it takes to stay at this level eventually eats away at me!      This weekend I met my girlfriends sister/brother in law.  This was a stressful event and I did my best to keep my ADHD in check.  I was good in conversation, didn't talk in to many tangents, and none of them would have suspected I have ADHD.  After being home for 1 day I am crashing!   I can't get ANYTHING done, i am depressed, beating myself up, and worried about every aspect of my life!  This is not the first time this has happened, and the fact that it keeps working out this way just makes the whole thing worse!     Does anyone else ever have this problem?   **TL;DR - After a weekend (and week before) of doing SO WELL with my adhd management I am crashing today beyond belief.**

898fd577afeb0659e185a7608862b6275c90288a0d135ba6e63dbf18622638f2;;;Diagnosed a few days ago and I don't really know what to expect.;;;Just a little background, I'm sixteen, at the end of my sophomore year, and have displayed symptoms of ADHD all my life, but never got a diagnosis until now because I had good grades all through elementary school and didn't really think about it after that, so I never got tested.  Ever since starting high school -- and even back in middle school, really -- my grades and general academic performance slipped. I started to suffer socially a bit, as well; I have a lot of friends, more than I did in elementary and middle school (probably just because the high school is way bigger), but I don't really feel like I connect to many of them very deeply, and end up spending the majority of my time alone in my room. I go out with friends maybe once a month, if even that often. At school, though, I'm very active with my friends, but mostly just goofing off.  Back to the point. A couple of weeks ago, my dad set up an appointment for me with a friend of his. His friend has multiple PhD's and is a renowned hypnotist or something like that. They figured they could hypnotize me into being more academically motivated. I didn't really get it, but I went along with it because I figured that it couldn't hurt.  In the preliminary interview, the doctor pointed out that I both described and was displaying symptoms of significant ADHD, and that that could explain my problems. After the session, my parents thought it would be worthwhile to pursue that possibility further, and they set up an appointment with my pediatrician.  Went in on Wednesday, did some interviewing, had a couple of my teachers fill out forms about me, and found out that I do, in fact, have inattentive ADHD. My doctor prescribed me some new medicine called Vayarin and recommended that I do a follow-up interview at a psychiatric ward because I was also displaying symptoms of depression and possibly anxiety.  I went in this morning with my parents to the ward. I went through an interview process and described my depression lapses, my near-suicide last month, stuff like that. Turns out it was pretty bad, because the doctors' primary recommendation was that I undergo "partial hospitalization", which would entail daily group therapy for five and a half hours. Since that couldn't fit into my schedule and frankly, the notion of taking such an extreme approach kind of frightened me, we decided to go with the second recommendation, which was weekly sessions with a psychologist I've visited several times in the past.  So now I don't really know what to expect. This new drug, Vayarin, has only been in use for about two years, and since it takes about a week for it to kick in, I've still got two or three days before I start to feel its effects. I'm also probably going to be starting on a stimulant of some sort, and possibly antidepressants. It's all happening pretty fast and I don't know what to expect. Does anyone have any experience with Vayarin or know how effective it is? Will I still be the same person when I'm medicated?  **tl;dr** I just got a diagnosis for inattentive ADHD and depression and don't really know what to expect, so I could use a little guidance.
4a43c591e944ed5e7ae68bbbfc5f9e722df82f6835eaa4c76a156d17ed76be6b;;;Soon to turn 25, and finally things are looking brighter.;;;Hey guys. So I started suspecting adhd at age 23 after a friend said how much I reminded of him (he had been diagnosed as a kid). After nearly two years, the final pieces of the puzzle have come together to add up to what might become a great future.  Mostly what is making this so great is by starting out with proper medication I can digest without that many side effects, but also by how much I learned on the matter, and how much I can really relate myself with. I have sort of learned how to control my sometimes very random thought pattern, and can finally understand why I, being a person many regards as *smart*, sometimes act like I suffer of retardation. It's all about my lack of focus.  My poor, past personia almost always had to laugh off some of the silly things he tend to do, such as leaving keys in the refrigerator or placing tools on top of cabinets for days. Or work related stuff such as plugging network cables to routers twice, effectively creating a "loop" that costs us moments of time for fault solution. As of this day, I can say this is due to my lack of focus, or more of the passive focus.   Usually my day goes about thinking about everything beyond what I am currently occupying myself with. I did many mistakes I really shouldn't have, and now I am starting to understand how to correct on them. I have also become better at reflecting my errors, and not dismiss them with an arrogant shrug when someone reveals my flaws. I understand now that I can do wrong, I am not perfect, will never be perfect, and have to take the time that others cannot always keep up with my adrenaline rushed thoughts. I may come off as a know-it-all, but I assure you I am not.  However, some of the positive things on medication, may eradicate into negative, and they stack up now. Currently, I am on dexamphetamine sulfate, but the side effects include anxiety and dry mouth. The dry mouth can be brushed off with water or chewing gum, but I fear my teeth will degrade over time. This is not good.  However, the dry mouth is just a minor side effect, it comes with the cost for an overall better person at work and at life. The real problem lies within anxiety, and the mayhem that comes with it. It seems that every time I come off the medications, my anxiety rushes in. I tend not to take medications during the weekend, and at evenings when I am all alone, my anxiety causes a general insomnia, irrational fear and confusion. Can others relate? I have yet to check up with a doctor, but I sometimes suspect what appears to be heart attacks, yet they only appear whenever I feel alone. I am almost certain it is just anxiety, but I followup with the doctor should rule it out.   Overall though, when I am bringing my game at work, I feel like an unruled champion when it comes to being focused and technical. That is all.

Adderall XR gave me to much PNS side effects and felt like i was on something.  The Vyvanse was great until it gave me hive like rashes. I liked the smooth "not on something" feeling. Coverage did not last no 12 hours, 5-6 hours top at 70mg  I read about Dexedrine Spansules and would like to try it. To me it sounds like Vyvanse with no amino acid in a Adderall XR Release style. Or a Levo-amphetamine removed Adderall XR  I brought it up before to Doctor and the convo was immediately switch to vyvanse. I ask wise /r/ADHD what would be a professional way to try asking when i go back to have rash checked?  Also i finished reading Healing ADD by Daniel G. Amen, and was wondering. dose anyone else get "locked" into negative thoughts?
31aa0738b5e644ee91744d8eb58cda583d43b1da53313d9e03e8dc46ff907b88;;;Healthy methods of consuming Caffeine?;;;Didn't know if this was the right subreddit for this, but I have severe ADHD that I treat with 60mg of Vyvanse and small Dexedrine "supplement" doses throughout the day. I also drink caffeine. Like, a lot of caffeine. Mixing caffeine with Vyvanse has actually been shown to increase the effectiveness of the Vyvanse, as well as the caffeine (I can't remember the actual word for this). If I don't drink caffeine, not only do I get withdrawal symptoms, but my medication actually works significantly less. My Vyvanse helps me get up and get going, whereas I've noticed the caffeine I drink throughout the day helps me to stay motivated and keep me going, better than Vyvanse alone can. At my job we get free fountain refills, so I just drink Mountain Dew all day. I used to drink coffee with lots of sugar and creamer, but then my next dental visit revealed that I had 12 new small cavities mostly in my molars, suggesting that the creamer and sugar in the coffee that I drank throughout the day had caused them. I'm very aware that Mountain Dew is not a good substitute for sugared-out-tooth-rotting-coffee, as soda's have recently been in the spotlight for potentially increasing the chances of developing type 2 Diabetes, and they're probably just as bad for your teeth. I have a selective eating disorder on top of having ADHD, which means that I don't like a lot of foods for a lot of different, often strange, reasons. That being said, I hate black coffee, and I absolutely abhor the taste of tea. As you can imagine, this puts me in a bind. My question is this: Is there any other methods of, I guess I'll call it, caffeinating myself? I don't want to drink any more sugared-up drinks or sodas, I'd prefer something either healthy or something that at least doesn't have any negative health effects.  My other question I guess, is is there such a thing as caffeinated water? Or maybe caffeine pills? If not, those would be a great idea, especially extended-release caffeine pills.

Examples from previous posts:  * ***Put on all of your clothes (including shoes) before you do your hair, that way you can just pick up and go if you realize you're running late.***    * This one has actually helped a lot.  Before, I'd spend a lot of time making my hair look right, but I didn't have my shoes on!  Then I'd realize I was running late and I'd still have to do the basics and then I'd miss my train.  * ***Segregate blocks of time for like activities.***    * In my bag I have a tablet, a bluetooth keyboard, a sweater, my screwdriver kit, and a pair of headphones.  Before, I'd be running around packing this stuff up while also getting dressed, brushing my teeth, feeding the cat, etc.  Lumping these activities together has saved time and resulted in a more organized morning.  * ***If you take public transit and have a smart phone or active computer, make it a habit to check the times until the next bus/train comes to your stop.***   * This one is dangerous, so be careful.  I've often found myself checking the next train time on my phone only to be sucked into facebook or reddit or the chatroom.  But by checking how much time remains until my next train, I have a keen idea of when I need to be out of the door and what I can still do before I head out.  # *Not all of these will apply to everyone of course, but these are just a few that I have found useful for my mornings!*  Share what has worked for you to inspire others, tweak existing routines to be more efficient, come up with brand new things to do if you find yourself with some free time!  If you want, break down your morning from when you wake up until you have to walk out of the door and assign activities to specific blocks of time based on _realistic_ predictions of how long each activity will take.  ##### Keep an eye on the clock throughout each morning.  The best way to gain a sense of time, a sense of how long things take, is to look at the clock before and after (and maybe during).

I found a new one and started seeing him today, and OMG he's amazing!! He's legitimately like a second version of my regular psychologist. I felt completely comfortable talking with him and he's very kind and caring. He offered to write me documentation for school right away, told me to keep seeing my regular guy and that he's fine with just seeing me for medication visits and that if there's a point where having any cross over, he'll ask me for permission to call my regular therapist and discuss things with him so that everyone is on board and I'm getting the best help I can from all available resources.   He prescribed me the generic of Ritalin, and were gonna try it for two weeks to see how I like it and whatnot. I'm starting with 5mg and each day I can increase the dosage by 5mg as I feel necessary to a maximum of 30mg a day. I probably won't be taking it on weekends unless I have a test or paper due on like a Monday, but I will be taking it during the school week. On June 10th were going to discuss how I'm doing on it and decide whether to put me on extended release, or to let me take a certain amount through certain points of the day, or if we need to try something new.   I'm so happy to finally have a chance now, y'know? I adore this guy, and I can't wait to tell my regular therapist that I finally found a good psychiatrist.

What can we do for him?;;;Hi there.  I'm a frequent reader here, because I, myself, have ADHD.  I'm 32f, and my partner is 39m.  He has two children from a previous marriage, and has full custody of them.  I spend most of my time with them, even though I technically rent a room nearby where I go to school so that I have space to study.    My partner has full custody of his boys (6 years old and 3 years old) because their mother is severely mentally ill, and has a bad drug habit, mainly with painkillers. She's also been diagnosed with ADHD (in addition to other mental conditions), and has in the past abused Ritalin (120 mg per day was what she was getting altogether from various psychiatrists).    Anyway, both boys have had understandable emotional issues due to the abuse they suffered at the hands of their mother, and now their confusion about her (she only has a couple hours a week of visitation with them, supervised by a therapist).  I know that some of their behavioral problems are likely a result of emotional stuff they're processing.  However, the younger one has major issues that look exactly like ADHD.  His mother actively did drugs while she was pregnant with him, whereas it's less likely that she did with the older one.  The younger one is delightful and engaging, hilarious and affectionate.  However, he has zero impulse control, enormous and terrifying temper tantrums, exhibits hyperfocus and distractibility that I'm all too familiar with myself, is unable (and I mean unable, not unwilling) to sit still or listen to instructions, and has major issues falling and staying asleep.   I've been around lots of kids in my life, both professionally and personally, and I know what's age-appropriate for a three year-old.  Some of this is probably very normal, but a lot of it is beginning to be really worrisome.  When does everyone think it's appropriate to seek help from a professional or a specialist?  What can we be doing here at home to make things easier for all of us?  His behavior is taxing, frustrating, and hurtful most of the time.  It's not his fault, but we don't know how to help.

I went to my family doctor, explaining that I had always had some issues with inattention and focusing. I could not for the life of me sit down and focus on any assignment I've ever done,every paper I wrote was extremely sloppy and it took me forever to start projects. I found this interfering with work and life.    The only thing I found was that I could actually go to class, sit in class for the full time, and generally pay attention throughout without much issue. This was the main reason why I did not seek treatment earlier    I did an assessment with him, and he suggested that there is a possibility that I did have ADHD.    He prescribed me 30mg, a lower dosage of Vyvanse for 2 weeks, to see if this would help me out. My question was, was the trial and error approach the best way to get a definite diagnosis?
c0f22333f9a58c45259c4bc7aa8020f8987f4fc413a440e92d7de647bd886119;;;Happy Hour! A great idea for motivating a team, and it even helped ME focus for an hour!;;;OK - So in spite of this ADHD thing, I manage a team of five people at work. Someone sent me this link to a concept called "Guilt Hour". I loved the idea, but I hated the name tremendously.   Basically you open a bridgeline, everyone discusses for the first few minutes what they'll be working on for the hour, and then you leave the B/L open but everyone stops talking (unless they're collaborating) and works "heads down" on whatever it is they've designated to do for the hour. At the end of the hour, you get back on the B/L and talk about what you accomplished.  http://actionmill.com/blog/get-your-team-unstuck-with-guilt-hour  I told my team about the idea and how I hated the name, so we call ours "Happy Hour" because in theory, at the end of the hour you'll be happier about doing something you'd been putting off.  We had our first one today and it went great! I personally loved it because I committed to clearing out my inbox and replying to emails. So many times I was tempted to stray, as I usually do, from my task but the knowledge that I had the responsibility of reporting in at the top of the hour kept me working and focused.  --- Agenda:  * 1:00-1:10 – Declare it: Your task to work on  * 1:10-1:50 – Do it: Bridgeline remains open, team works on tasks “heads down”. Use the bridge for questions or collaboration if needed.  * 1:50-2:00 – Move on: Share whatever victories we can!   Ground rules: No guilt! Only happy! Collaborate when needed. Come prepared with what you want to work on.  ---  It worked so well my team wants to keep doing it every week. Thought it might help some of you here, if you could suggest it to your teammates, managers, etc.

Food makes me lose my focus! :(;;;I've been diagnosed and medicated for a few months now (Adderall XR 10mg + Adderall IR 5mg booster as needed), and while it's been working wonders for my symptoms, I've been having some trouble when it comes to food.  Fortunately, I have had no reduction in appetite whatsoever while medicated, and I've been eating just as much as I always have-- except, It seems that the effects of the Adderall seem to go downhill quickly after I eat a regular-sized meal. I know that acidic foods inhibit absorption, so I'm careful not to combine the two, but this seems to be an entirely different problem.  My medication works best when I take it on an empty stomach in the morning (or after having eaten very little). But even if I've given it plenty of time to absorb first (an hour or more), my focus goes downhill quickly after I eat-- especially when I eat protein- or fat-heavy meals, and I feel sluggish and start to zone out. Eating very light, carb-based meals makes me feel cranky (and hungry!) by the day's end, but it seems to be the only thing that doesn't affect my medication. Strangely, I've heard other people saying the opposite-- that carbs make them lose their focus (which makes sense, with a sugar crash and all), so I don't really know what to make of this. Occasionally I will take a 5mg IR booster in the afternoon, and while this often helps, it still seems highly dependent on the amount of food I have in my stomach.   Has anyone had this problem? Any ideas? I hate feeling like I have to go hungry in order to get the full benefit of my medication. :(
e5d3342508942eaff1aa4b1b8a48911e04654b1801337d0cb7d31b242b449ce0;;;Out of sight, out of mind?;;;I'm new to this subreddit, but a lot of the things I've read here in the past few days really strike home for me. I'm 27/F and I was just recently diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder and have been taking a SSRI, which has helped with the anxiety, but I am starting to realize other problems. Some of these are: I've always gotten extremely interested in new hobbies (usually crafty things) and then abandoned them after a few days to a couple weeks, disorganization, reading multiple books at a time and never finishing them, not being motivated to do things even though I really want to (like picking up that towel or putting my clothes away), being distracted during conversations, being stressed about being late somewhere (the anxiety) and then being way early because I am terrible at guessing how long it should take to get there...all things I've seen mentioned here.  What I haven't seen mentioned here (sorry if it has) is an "out of sight, out of mind" mentality, which lead me to my ADHD research. One of my main annoyances is that if I put something in a closet...it is forgotten. I have to make an effort every once in a while to remind myself what's in the pantry. My plants and fish tank have to be in a room I am in a lot because if they weren't I would forget to feed/water them. So on and so forth. I know that this happens, which leads me to leave things out pretty much everywhere. This then makes me frustrated because I don't want to put it away because I'll forget it, but if I leave it out I hate how messy my apartment is but don't often have much motivation to clean it up.   Does anyone else have experience with this? Any tips on how to combat it?   Edit: I have an appointment this week with a new doc (had one appt. with a therapist who turned out to be out of network) and I'll be bringing up all these things.

This was a while ago, I have been unmedicated for three months now.  To get to the point, I feel like I won't live up to my full potential now, and I feel so pathetic... I would like to return to medication in college, It's almost a paradox, to be dependent on medication, to have the full potential, and yet it's a weakness according to my boyfriend.. He is diagnosed with ADHD as well, but he feels that meds are never necessary, but then again he's never been medicated.   I don't even know the point of this post anymore. I'm upset and crying and I need consolation... Am I really considered weak because I would depend on medication (later)? It's a horrid paradox.... I don't know, I don't know..  **TL; DR: Upset, overwhelmed by paradox of meds equating to weakness of character or allowing full potential in life**

How many people have experienced wins since last Wednesday? Everyone, that's who. So share them!;;;##### WIN WEDNESDAY!!!  *Just wanted to remind people to upvote this post. Recently, our weekly threads get pushed off the page pretty quick. More upvotes = more wins = more people getting inspired (it is a cycle).*  #####Science behind Win Wednesday (new)  * Scientists think our brain has a built in negativity bias by reacting more to a negative stimulus. In effect, our brain is like velcro for negative experiences and teflon for positive ones.   * Painful experiences are usually more memorable than positive ones and lasting, good relationships typically need at least a 5:1 ratio of positive to negative interactions.  * By **tilting toward the good** you are leveling the playing field.    * **Instead of positive experiences washing through you like water through a sieve, they’ll collect in the implicit memory deep down in your brain.**  * **Soak in the positive events in your life**   * By pausing and holding that positive feeling for a BIT longer, you are slowly changing the wiring of your brain.   *I have much more information on the neuroscience of recognizing the good, let me know if you want more info.*  ***  Win Wednesday is a chance to focus on our accomplishments for the week. Doing this enough WILL change your brain for the better!  ###***The Sacred Creed of Win Wednesday:***  * **Each and every one of us have victories every week, be they great or small. But in Win Wednesday, *no* victory is truly a small one.**  * **Whatever "level" you happen to be at, progress is *always* a cause for celebration!**   * **Please don’t discount anything you have done. The whole point is to share how YOU won, and did not let your ADHD win!** Check out the examples to see what we mean!**  *** * The point of Win Wednesday is equally **to share our wins AND celebrate the wins of others!** If you do or don’t have a win, feel free to give positive support and cheer to those posting (not just upvoting)!  * **Each week Win Wednesday gets hundreds of views, but only 5 people replying to the winning comments...let’s change things this week!** Just saying “good job” means a lot to someone who has been struggling!  ***  ##### PHENOMENAL EXAMPLES FROM PAST WEEKS: (updated 5/28) **FRESH**  * I graduated college!  Fuck yeah! * I paid off my credit card. * FINALLY hung my custom mirror that's been gathering dust in the hallway for about a month. * Finished some more group projects ahead of schedule so I'm not the one everyone is waiting on. * Today I realized I was the common denominator in many bad relationships that are most important to me. I told my loved ones this and started a new chapter today. Feels good. * So far, I've managed to make $90 doing different repair work. This is a pretty big deal for me, my ADHD is bad enough that I'm on disability * I had my highest GPA ever with my most difficult courses ever * Got my blood work done, got stuff needed for other medical testing, and I set up an appointment with a woman's counselor to add to the therapy I am already doing * I'm late but I finally stopped talking about auditioning for a play at my local theater and did it!  * I got engaged. :) * I think I have finally identified a definable improvement of my meds. * Many many more!  ##### We love you, /r/adhd!

The gist is that self-imposed limitations are useful in exploring different avenues of thought, and can also be fun! (I'm NOT saying that ADHD is useful or fun, I'm also NOT saying it can't be useful or fun either, decide for yourself how you view the condition.)   If we imagine a chess board, with all our pieces, and there are no limitations to what any of the pieces can do, chess suddenly becomes quite uninteresting. When you introduce limitations on what pieces can do and when, i.e. 'Rules', only then do we have a decent board game.  Before my diagnosis it was obvious to me that I was losing every 'game' I played. I tried many different strategies but would always lose in the end. This made me very depressed and anxious. When someone suffers from a neurological condition it's very difficult for them to have insight into said condition, they just don't know the rules of their own game.   After my diagnosis I realised that my rules were different from most people's because my brain is different. Looking at my behaviour, past and present, through the framework of 'ADHD' has allowed me to slowly begin to understand the rules, I believe my understanding will only grow as I'm now looking in the right places. So armed, I feel much better about the prospect of tackling my problems, because I'm confident I'll eventually find a way to 'win'.  CHECKMATE ADHD!!!

A general discussion that will help many folks   II. My situation   (if it's too much text, just read first half) Please comment your experiences!  ----  I. There are countless reasons why many folks find it impossible or difficult to do what everyone knows is the ideal -- communicate fully with your doctor.  Possible Reasons many folks have limited ability to communicate with his/her doctor:  1. a. no health coverage; b. limited access to health services (e.g., few doctors or clinics in the area, long waits for appointments, when you do get to the appointment the doc is rushed, your doc doesn’t respond to calls regularly) 2. your current doctor isn’t one you feel you can communicate openly with. Possible reasons: a) she tells your parents everything; b) she thinks you want drugs to abuse them; c) she doesn’t believe you; d) you don’t trust her; e) she doesn't seem to care about you and/or you feel she doesn't care about the details/intricacies to treat you adaquately; f) and more 3. Your family, friends, or community has a bias towards seeking help, has narrow-minded views towards psychiatric care, thinks ADHD is fake, thinks medication=weakness or cheating, has religious views that apply to the subject, or any of those all-too-common obstacles 4. You have more than one doctor and have to figure out how to merge the care in the best way; you have multiple doctors that give you different or opposite feedback/advice 5. Your doctor insists something about you that you know isn't really truly what your situation is, and she is trying to treat you based on false premises   **For those of you that have had to deal with this, given the context that it is generally understood you should always “ask your doctor” (and similar discourse with this theme):**  1. What were your struggles? 2. What did you do? 3. What do you suggest for others in this situation?  ------- II. Part two, my situation that I'm struggling with.  I am currently studying in university and in a **transition** from the Psychiatrist I have been seeing since I was 15, which means seeing him is connected with my parents, and I want to become independent.   A Problem: he insists I have Bipolar Disorder I, but I don’t fit the criteria in the DSM-IV-TR because I had never had a Manic Episode.  I have had symptoms like: mood irregularity, times of deep depression, cyclical depression, anxiety, sleep troubles, cognitive problems, (and this psychiatrist said I had irritability that was close enough to being manic, but I disagree), and a few other symptoms, but upon my own analysis and self-evaluation and input from other pdocs, I think the more accurate term may be Mood Disorder NOS. I like this because it allows me and my doc to move past the labeling and move on to *treating the symptoms*.    The big problem I have now is that this old doc has prescribed me with an anti-psychotic since I was 15, and he insists that without one I will have a breakdown or manic episode or fail miserably at school and life or something, but my psychiatrist that I’ve recently started seeing through my university does not think my anti-psychotic (Latuda) is necessary, because I don't have Bipolar Disorder. I'M CONFUSED.  I am very greatful for my University Psychiatrist because she put the focus on treating my ADHD symptoms. She referred me to an ADHD specialist psychologist who diagnosed me with severe ADHD inattentive and hyperactive type (ADHD-C).  I have since just started a stimulant! (After long thinking one would help and being denied the chance to try it). My adolescence psychiatrist insisted that an ADHD stimulant would lead me to become manic, but he was wrong.  Adderall has helped me so much.  In addition to treating my ADHD symptoms, it has *improved my mood* and I have felt a humongous *decrease in anxiety* [I hardly use the Klonopin I was previously using often (~4 days/week)]. (Side note: I've always had a high pulse rate, ~111+ resting, but since starting Adderall my pulse has GONE DOWN.)  This points to the conclusion that my mood problems and all that were symptoms of my severe and untreated ADHD.  It seems as though my inability to concentrate, focus on school and socially and with my parents, inability to complete assignments and tasks, etc--were actually the root of my mood problems and anxiety and all that.  But the problem: I currently take Latuda, Lamictal, Strattera, Adderall.  I have no idea if the anti-psychotic and/or the mood-stabilizer is necessary. It's a **major dilemma** because I am in university and I'm taking summer school and will not have a break that is over 1 week until Christmas break, which is only like 3 weeks, then I don't know when I'll have a long break. POINT: if I stop taking one of these either a) superfluous, b) potentially  harmful, or c) absolutely necessary to my stability;  and it turns out it's 'c', then I'll get screwed over in my school work and stuff and possibly suffer really crappy lame stuff.  My adolescence pdoc insists I will break down if I stop taking them, and my new pdoc is pretty sure that I don't need them, but she isn't sure (maybe because she's known me less time) and says it's up to me. Relevant: I have had periods in my life where I had hallucinations.  So adolescence pdoc claims these will return if I cease the anti-psychotic.  HALP. What do I do????  **TL; DR: Just read 'I. A general discussion that will help many folks' AND please comment with your experiences  :) **    Edit: your vs you're; lol

After fifteen years coping with my ADHD-PI with the help of medication, I've now been off meds for about seven months (incl. three months while we were still trying). I'm now about four months pregnant and I reckon I won't be able to go back on them for another year at least. It was pretty terrifying at first thinking that my life would return to the constant failures I racked up before proper treatment. While that hasn't happened, I find that I've pursued a career that requires sustained attention and engagement, and also set personal standards for myself that I find very difficult to meet now. The daily struggle to stay on task has returned in a big way, and it's driving me bonkers. Not necessarily looking for any advice here, just feeling a bit alone in this right now and wondering if anyone else has gone through it.

I thought y'all would appreciate it.;;;In talking to her about pursuing an opportunity to work with a highly regarded pastry chef, in 3 parts:  Me: - you found this and you are the one with the baking skills, notable too, you follow baking directions, unlike some I know.  ;  )  Her: Your implication is that baking directions are somehow the only directions you don't follow....HAHAHAHA! Silly rabbit!  Me: You chastise me unfairly me thinks. Directions are for those of a precise nature, or as you like to be, involved in culinary pursuits, as in baking; making scrumptious things that please the palate and sate the appetite.   There are those of us that are not inclined to follow direction, either because we are confident in our abilities to take a pot shot, have a distrusting relationship with authority, or, more often than not, are willing to step outside the box and challenge convention (or simply piss someone off).    Considering these traits, precise baking instructions, DMV tests and any directions written in more than one language are to be avoided. If directions are "followed" (simply skimmed - at best) it is done in order to offer some sort of solace to wives or girlfriends, the infirm, nosey onlookers, ignorant bystanders, and the wandering elderly.   These qualities are, more often than not, deeply instilled at a young age, and are standard operating procedures, put in place by our hero - MacGyver.

That is not how I roll, and I'm now instead an incredibly shame filled person because I don't quite measure up.  "If it's so hard, how come the other kids can do it?"  This question pretty much fucked me up. I'm still undoing the damage.    You know what would have been "easy" and just as educational?   Playing.  Most of the lessons I learned, and the bulk of my memory from elementary school, is talking, playing, and learning with other students during recess. A teacher had us grow some vegetables, and thanks to that I actually remembered photosynthesis, the stages of the seeds, and even genetics. (I got a pretty good grasp on genetics in the 5th grade because our teacher thought it would be fun to plant peas. I learned punnett squares and shit. That was a good lesson, Mrs. Wohlheiter. Thank you.) I remember the solar system because we were out on the blacktop with beachballs, attempting to space ourselves out as proportionally as we could. That was fun.   Convexly.  I spent high school in a bitter struggle against my grades without medication. I learned how to write essays, pay attention in class, do homework in a way that suits me.  I learned how to talk to teachers about my problems instead of just pretending things are okay and will work themselves out.  I participated in class. I talked.  My mom, when I was 17, said "I think you're growing out of your ADHD."  I can safely say, having dropped out of college from all of the problems I thought I'd managed to solved in high school, that was not the case.  I'm still off meds.  I don't feel in control.  I was on meds during a point in my life where they really hindered me.  And then off meds when I really needed them.  What the fuck.    **So here's the TL;DR.** I should have been off of medication, and had more learning/play time in elementary school.  I should have been ON medication for the more academically important high school.  Also, I would have actually talked to my psychiatrist at this time in my life, instead of just wandering into a strange mans office with my mother and playing with magnetic marbles while they speculated about my behavior and what to do about it. I honestly had no idea that man was my psych.   How about you? What was school like for you? What would you change?

I'm a 16 year old male and I'm being tested with a QB test tomorrow. I've always thought I was different my parents put it down to Aspergers syndrome, (she worked with autisic kids) but now I'm being tested for ADHD, I know roughly what the test is.   But what I really want to know is what to expect being diagnosed as ADHD. I'm worried people will treat me different because there is a guy with ADHD in my year, he is the nicest guy but he is always picked on by others, I know that even my closest friends have joked about it. Thanks guys, I appreciate any answers, I hope this wasn't to long.  **TL:DR** How do I live with ADHD in society?

Thanks  Learning more and more about ADHD everyday. Unfortunately it's all bad which makes sense since it is a disorder. But I feel like there has to be something good or something I'm better at because of ADHD.

How do I get back on the bandwagon?;;;Hi y'all, I've been subscribed for a couple weeks; first time poster. Little background: diagnosed with ADHD (the inattentive, non-hyper kind) when I was in the fifth grade. Started taking Ritalin and saw my grades go from C's and D's to A's. Then when I was in junior high I stopped taking my meds for some reason. I seriously don't remember why I stopped. My guess is, I thought I was better and could manage without them. I coped (albeit barely) through high school and college. Somehow, I managed to get mostly A's and B's but I procrastinated terribly and generally felt frustrated with my study habits (or lack thereof). I love learning but I was always the kid who had potential but lacked motivation. I'm sure most of you have heard that at some point in your lives.  Now I'm 25, married, a mom, and I feel like I just can't juggle it all anymore, especially on the reduced amount of sleep I'm getting. Back in December I started seeing an ADHD specialist in my town but she just wasn't a good fit for me. Her office was a mess, her receptionist never had her stuff together (e.g., they just billed my insurance last week for a visit I had in December), and she tried to push Juice Plus and Reiki on me. Just wasn't a good match.  Basically, what I'm hoping for from you all is some advice as to where to go next. I was hoping I could see some improvement from a more natural treatment plan (better diet, exercise, therapy, etc.) but honestly, I just don't have the time right now, or the focus. Maybe I will someday. For now I just need to get my stuff together. Drugs baby, drugs. Now that I'm done breastfeeding they are a viable option. Do most of you just have your general MD prescribe your meds? Do you see a psychiatrist? A psychologist? I know I need some therapy for this and other issues but having to juggle multiple doctors sounds exhausting. Help?  **TL;DR-** 25 y/o female, diagnosed as a child. No formal treatment since early teens. Where should I start?  Any help is greatly appreciated!!

I've been taking 20mg and I do notice some difference. I probably wouldn't have if it wasn't because I didn't know how other people felt and would still be thinking that it wasn't working for me. I think I'll keep taking them for a while, and see how it goes. Thanks again, you guys are great!  I've been prescribed 10 mg. It literally did nothing for me. I took it for about a 10 days and I just said fuck it, and took 2 to see if a larger dose would make a difference. I *might* feel some difference, but really, nothing like other people report. No extra motivation, no imnsomnia (I've actually taken a nap about 2 hours after I'd taken it), not even side effects (appetite lost, that "coming down feeling" most people seem to hate so much)..not much of anything; the 20 mg does help me a bit, but honestly nothing like I've read. I told my doctor and he said that I should try it for at least 20 days before we decide on another med. It's my understanding that Ritalin works right away, so, why would he tell me to wait 20 days?. Also he said that if this one doesn't work, we'll try Straterra; I don't have much hope on that one either since it's pretty much the same thing as Ritalin, isn't it? Where I live doctors won't prescribe Adderal, Vyvanese or anything that's an amphetamine. It took me about a year to finally be prescribed Ritalin (tried Wellbutrin before, it improved my mood, but did nothing for my adhd).  So pretty much I'd like to know if anyone around here took Ritalin for a while before it actually started to work?  tl;dr: How long did you take Ritalin for before you decided it was working for you?

I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 9 years old and started taking meds when I was in 4th grade, which was done by having a 9-year old me leave the crowded elementary school cafeteria and take a pill in the nurses office. The publicity of this made me, from a very young age, embarrassed about taking pills for my ADHD.  There were a few days that I forgot to take my meds, and teachers and peers would observe that I behaved differently, sometimes I was enough of a spaz that teachers would call my parents and mention that I was behaving strangely that day, which initially made me want to never stop taking them, and insecure about who I was with my "normal" brain.   In high school, I started growing into myself a bit, hanging out with more friends after school, when my pills had worn off (at this point I was taking an 8-hour every morning, I stopped having to go to the school nurse in junior high). And I began to notice that the medicated me was a different person than the "normal" me. So I decided, in sophomore year, to stop taking medication.  Towards the end of junior high I discovered I had depression. In high school, I started seeing a counselor, but stopped because one day, I just failed to make my next appointment and never got around to doing it.   Now let's jump to today. I'm about to go int my 4th year of college (which will not be last, or possibly not even my penultimate year). In November my girlfriend of 4 years broke up with me and I was forced to move out of our apartment and I now live alone. My grades are not great, but I was doing about okay. Now I find myself less motivated and more depressed than ever before in my life. I sit in my apartment, bored shitless, knowing I have a ton of work to do, then I decide to get high and watch The West Wing instead of doing homework that isn't necessarily long or difficult. I'm not sure how to get my ass back into gear, and I don't want to take pills that would alter my personality. I just discovered this community (and that it's not full of stupid posers who claim they have ADHD and actually just get bored doing boring things sometimes) and I'm next to certain there are plenty of you guys that can empathize.  **Tl;dr I have Depression and ADHD, totally unmotivated, I don't want to take pills though**

Okay, onto the problem/question: we have been having arguments daily. I know that some of this comes from the stress of having a new baby but most of it comes from our communication challenges that have stemmed for over a decade. We have always had fights that seems so cyclical. I can’t even really pinpoint how they start but I always forget what we are actually talking about and the communication feels so jumbled that I’m having trouble writing it down now. Often, my forgetfulness combined with my need to make sure that he is not *really* frustrated furthers the conflict. So...I’m wondering if others here feel like this during arguments and how you deal with this? Also, if you have a partner, have they made an effort to learn about ADHD? How have you talked about it or communicated what you need? Do you have rules about how to fight?

I'm starting to feel worthless and hopeless.;;;I'm 28 and was diagnosed by a phsycologist in March. I've been on medication since March and my brain function is overwhelmingly improved, but the behavioral issues still plague me and they're starting to effect my relationship with my GF who I'm hoping to be engaged to by the end of the year. She's a very kind, patient, and proactive person. After an episode last night though. I can tell there are doubts and concerns about her future and dealing with me for the rest of her life. I work in customer service and my apologies feel hollow and and that phrase has lost it's meaning almost entirely. My main symptoms are impulsivity in speech and action and forgetfullness. I've tried all sorts of behavioral changes but nothing sticks. Help please. I'm starting to feel helpless and worthless.

I was never a hyperactive child, but I almost failed the third grade because I couldn't concentrate and would often lose large portions of the day without knowing what happened. The only behavioral problems I had were that I would "zone out" or get distracted by simple things like the eraser on my pensil. After I was diagnosed, my mother did research to see what our options were. She didn't want me taking pills for the rest of my life and the short time that I did take Ritalin, there were many negative side effects.   I was taken to a therapist who specialized in ADD/ADHD. There, I went through a series of tests, including having my brain waves measured. In the following months I went through biofeedback therapy. Electrodes were attached to my head and I was told to focus on a computer screen. If I concentrated hard enough it would make a fish swim through a maze or a race car drive around a track. Aparently this worked, because I haven't taken any medication for ADD since I was 9  years old (I am now 24). I continued the rest of my education through college with decent grades. I still "zone out" some times, especially if I'm tired or bored, but as an adult, it's really more of a personality quirk than a disorder.  TL;DR, I was diagnosed with ADD at in the 3rd grade and went though biofeedback therapy which did wonders for me.  Anyways, I was wondering if anyone else has had experience with biofeedback therapy. If not, what was your ADD/ADHD experience? How has your diagnosis affected you?

(Look up [steroid dementia syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid_dementia_syndrome) for more info.)   The TLDR version of the story is that I talked to my doctor about it and went off all of my asthma/ADD/depression medications.  I've been off them for nearly two weeks now, and I'm already feeling better.    **Now I'm wondering, how many other people are being diagnosed with ADHD, depression, and memory (or learning) problems when in fact it is due to taking steroid medications?**  I've seen articles that try to link asthma to ADHD in kids, but what if it's not the asthma, it's the medication that's causing the ADHD?   In my case I took fluticasone propionate, but it seems that all glucocorticoid medications (prednisone is a common one) can cause memory and attention problems due to the elevation of cortisol in the body.

I decided to write this, and as soon as I wrote the title, the feelings came.  Hubby &amp; I (both ADHD-PI) have started meds, and our apartment is clean(er), but our budget! We are both fairly good at avoiding large impulse buys--$40 is enough to make us pause--but we'll consistently drop $8-$10 on fast food. Now that we are making less money (I was in school, then he was in school), we can't believe how much money we spend on food that doesn't even taste that good.   We are working on it, and we seem to have a strategy: if we are feeling impulsive, just go to the closest grocery store. We both prefer King Soopers to Super Target, but King Soopers is across a very busy street, while Super Target is on the same side of the street. So we're just going to the first, most convenient place where groceries can be had.   We just had our second morning of Not Going Out For Breakfast: At Super Target, we bought a dozen eggs, slices of cheese, a pound of sausage, shredded potatoes, and english muffins. We cooked *all* the sausage, eggs, and potatoes together. We made egg, sausage, potato, and cheese sandwiches for breakfast. We put all the leftovers in a massive container in the fridge. This morning, we had more. It looks like we have breakfast for a freaking week!   I'm excited, but I really really really hope we can stick to it. You know the feeling that if you don't say/do something right away, you'll forget? We're trying to apply that with food: If we don't cook it now, it won't get cooked.   Our next challenge is the car. I'm thinking emergency kits of snacks we like that will tide us over until we can get home, so there are no pit stops. Maybe adding "food" to our litany of "phone, wallet, keys" before leaving the house. Last week I went to work without the sandwich that hubby had just made for me!  **TL;DR: Fast food is everywhere and it ruins our budget! We're working on it, but there's always a fear of failure.**

To clarify, I am seeking the opinions and experience of other users and not medical advice. I am diagnosed, prescribed and have a dr's appointment next Tuesday the 2nd;;;I am worried about dependancy. I started off at 20mg which was okay, upped my dose to 40 and that seemed to work. Then, after a few weeks of that I felt it was wearing off earlier than it should so then we went to **60mg** (=2x20 in am + 1x20 in pm).   However, now I feel that 60 isn't working like it did and was going to talk to my dr about maybe ANOTHER increase. **QUESTION**: Is this normal?  * **Elaboration**: This drug has changed my life - I'm completing things I always knew I could but was so totally frustrated by my inability to focus. I have become a normal human being. However I worry about drug addiction and chemical dependancy - next week 80mg, then 100mgs...when is it the 'right' amount?  * I should add that I really trusted my other doctor but she had an unexpected early medical leave while we were in this process. This new guy does seem nice but I'm just wary of being **over-medicated**.  **Also** - because the drug is working miracles for me I am worried that if I bring up needing a higher dose he may perceive that as *drug-seeking* behaviour and cut me off entirely. * **possibly irrelevant-feel free to skip**: First doc and I took a while to get here, first by trying to treat my OCD, anti-anxiety meds, Zoloft.. In other words Vyvanse was the last thing on a long list - and it worked!   **TL;DR** I am gradually needing more and more **Vyvanse**, does this imply **tolerance**? Does that imply **dependancy** and hence **addiction**? Do doctor's perceive it this way? Or will they happily write out prescriptions without really thinking about the long-term effect on a patient's life?

I have to call him to tell him which dose works best for me, but I only get 3 days on the 60 and it's hard for me to tell that quickly if I think it's too high for me or not (though I guess if I"m not in a terrible state maybe it's ok.) I don't know what symptoms to look for besides focusing too much, being incredibly irritable, or feeling like a zombie (I don't feel like that, just more tired but I think that's just my insomnia acting up). I figure there has to be other cues, especially more subtle ones, to keep an eye out.  .   So my question. **Have you ever been on too high a dose of vyvanse** (even if later you had to push it up to that dose later), like if you were titrating and found out a lesser dose was better, **and what did you experience that you knew it was too much?**   .  Also a tack on if you care to answer too: **what was the best thing you did/changed to get the best effects from your medication** (maybe certain eating patterns, way you take it, etc). Thanks for any assistance, I really appreciate it :)  .   **tl;dr:** I have to tell my psychiatrist which dose of Vyvanse is best for me and not sure how to tell if 60 is too high for me. Have you been on a too high dose of Vyvanse, and how did you know it was too high? (like symptoms you felt)

All my life I've written myself of as lazy and have been experimenting on how to maximize my discipline and process. Despite my shortcoming of being lazy, I've managed to work hard every day and grow as an artist (thanks for the routine of professional work). I've always been a jack of all traits, because the video-game art field is so huge I've been able to jump between different areas. Since I've been quite successful and happy doing this, I suspect it has masked an underlying illness -- ADHD.  I have all the signs but feel deeply ashamed that I somehow can write off my laziness as ADHD when I'm both successful and good at what I do and I see people struggle a hell of a lot more in life than I do.  But lately I've been going through my own version of HELL. I quit my job and I'm in the process of starting up my own business, since I'm a jack of all traits I'm _perfect_ for a small game studio startup.   The feeling I get when I start a task is nails of black board. Every time it feels like I'm holding my breath and the _only_ relief is to procrastinate with some Reddit or video-game. The novelty of working on my own game has worn off and it's extremely hard for me to focus on _anything_. I've tried just about every other process I've equipped myself with... To no avail.  What freightens me the most: I should _LOVE_ this. I _LOVE_ working on games so fucking much, it's been my sole passion all my life!  A long story short(ish): I went to a cognitive psychologist who referred me to a ADHD specialist. As I'm in the middle of starting up my own company without health care I can't afford doing the tests to diagnose ADHD (2000$, really?).  I meditate, I break down tasks, I've practiced positive psychology (since high school), I exercise regularly, I sleep well, eat my vitamins, have a healthy diet (no sugar, plenty veggies, plenty fat)...   Please help, I feel like I'm suffocating. I need to find a way to work because other people depend on me. What can I do? Does this even sound like ADHD?   **TLDR; I'm an artist and suspect I have ADHD, can't afford to get the test to diagnose me. Need to start focusing. **

It suits me fine if they never learn a thing about it. Im content and supported by talking with others who have it and just educating myself.

I am pretty certain this question has been covered in some way or other in this forum but I am new here. Also if there is anyone UK based what was the process you went through towards getting diagnosed, and being provided with treatment?  **Edit: Thanks for all the responses guys, it has been interesting reading all your answers and the changes that have happened since I will, certainly look into it as it seems that I relate to most of you in one way or another**
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;I was diagnosed years ago and I'm just now beginning to see the appeal of medication.;;;A few years ago I was diagnosed with ADHD, predominantly the inattentive type, but for the most part I ignored the diagnosis since by and large I didn't really feel like it was causing me any undue stress. However, something lately has really altered my ability to tolerate disorder and now my car, room, desk, etc are completely clean. Just like that. I've begun to feel like my brain is my main source of power and that I should strengthen it as much as possible.   Anyway, it seems like whenever I try to sit down and do something that I supposedly care about, like drawing or reading, I somehow lose my grip on it and pick up something else to do. I’ll find myself bouncing from topic to topic until it eventually bores me. I feel compelled to know everything and be everywhere whilst simultaneously considering the fact that oblivion is my ultimate reward. Regardless of what I accomplish oblivion will show up at the end of my life and remove my memories of it. The concept is utterly horrifying to me.   I feel like if I could live forever I would finally be able to focus on all the things I care about and I’d be able to piece together a perfect understanding of the universe. Unfortunately, I don’t have the luxury of living forever so I just bounce uselessly from topic to topic. What I’d like to do is take some kind of drug that will allow me to focus on the the things I care about for a few hours and then wear off. I don’t want to be under the effects of an ADHD drug all day every day, I want to use drugs in a utilitarian fashion.   The last drug I tried was Strattera and the experience was horrible. I felt so... small. I’m used to swimming in an ocean of thoughts and ideas and when I was on Strattera I felt trapped and stifled. It reminded me of Sylvia Plath’s “The Bell Jar”, it’s no wonder she put her head in an oven, I certainly wanted to. I can’t say I’m shocked that drug has a suicidal thoughts warning. Just thinking about how it felt makes jumping off a bridge sound like a great idea.   Another thing I’ve been considering is lucid dreaming. I’ve gotten myself to lucid dream here and there but never on a consistent basis. Improving my ability to do it more consistently would make me feel far more powerful.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Diagnosed Wednesday, took Ritalin and my life is changed.;;;My appointment was  originally July 15. Luckily i didn't miss the call from my psychiatrist's office this time letting me know there was a cancellation.   It was 9AM and the available appointment was at 10. I ran to my supervisors office and asked and told her it was to treat my ADHD. She told me to run like the wind. I've had a very understanding boss.   It was my first visit to a psychiatrist. He didn't hook me up to machines, inundate me with examinations, or delve into the history of my inner hatred toward Justin Bieber.   Long story short he said I had severe ADHD. My acting career hid the symptoms as a child and I've just been coping at increasingly ineffective levels ever since.   He put me on a very aggressive titration. Ritalin 10 twice a day for 5 days, then 20mg twice a day for 5 days, and finally 30mg twice a day for 10 days with a follow up appointment.   My first dose was like waiting for Christmas. I had done it. I finally got help and this was what I had been waiting for. I became slightly light headed and extremely thirsty at work. I decided I should just go about my day and see what happens instead of waiting around and inducing a placebo effect.   So i got to work. Aside from the light headedness I was wondering if it was even working. Then I realized I had just completed a task I had been putting of for a month. People came in my office to talk. I chatted, went back to work. By the end of the day I had completed 5 tasks in 2 hours. A record for me.   I read a chapter in my book for school. Held an online conversation simultaneously. Took a quiz over the chapter and made a 95. Insane.   The next day I destroyed my to do list. Furthermore my phone had 75% battery at the end of the day. I hadn't looked at reddit once or anything else for that matter.   In my personal life I listen better. I think before I speak and I stopped eating as much junk food. I drink half as many coke zeros as I did, and have lost 4 pounds. I was also able to write this long ass post without stopping.   I read that it affects your appetite. This has not been the case. I just don't eat candy as a snack anymore.   Anyway just wanted to share my experience. If anyone read this and hasn't been diagnosed, please get out there and do it. Every task completed is a victory when you have adhd.   Tl;Dr Get diagnosed, get help (whatever works best for you)  and have the sweetest victory of your life.

You will be held gently accountable (which is a good thing!) and we can check in with you...helping YOU get things done.  *I suggest you read the whole post to be MORE successful, so put in the little extra initial effort and continue reading....*  *** ## Choose the participation method that works for you: * **Most important task** - Share one (or a couple) **HIGH-PRIORITY** tasks that you really would like to finally finish.  *(Ex. Set a doctors appointment, finish assignment, clean the kitchen...whatever YOU think is most important.)* * **Make a list** - Post a list of all the things you want to accomplish this week.  *(I highly recommend identifying the top 3 priorities.)* * **Feed your soul** - Sometimes by relaxing and having fun we have more energy to get more done. **List a couple FUN items to make your list more exciting.**  **Need/Want to copy last week's list *verbatim*?  Absolutely DO SO!**  *Those might be your keystone habits. Once you start doing those regularly you are able to do more. soon they will be automatic and you can put your focus elsewhere.*  *** By sharing our goal(s) with this understanding community, we can keep each other **accountable**...and **celebrate our successes**, large or small!  **Don’t forget to return for [Win Wedenesday] to flaunt your successes!**  ;-)  By getting one small task done it creates **momentum**, **trust** in yourself, **confidence**, and you will feel like doing more.  *** ## Suggested Guidelines * **Prioritize your list.** One thing you want to get done (or start). What is the most important thing for you? (If making a list works best for you feel free to do that too!) * **Add a finish OR start deadline.** By committing to a date/time, we can check on your progress. * **Edit your comment when done.** - Come back and edit your comment when you have finished your goal.

Study 2 hours is. * **Break it down** - Instead of saying clean my room...it might help to say, “Clean room for 10 minutes or pick up trash in room.” * **Write it down elsewhere** - Sticky note by computer.  Google calendar.  Agenda.  Write it down so you don't forget.  Our working memories are flaky.... * **Start small...build up slowly** - We want to build on small successes so committing to cleaning your entire house might be a bit too much to handle.  Pick a room (or a task like ‘pick up dirty laundry’)  instead. * **Want to study for 2 hours a day?** *Commit to studying 30 minutes to make it easier on you.*  *** ## Examples from previous weeks: * Tidy room. * Buy car. * Go to work. * Attend all my classes on time. * Reschedule appointment. * Mornings: brush teeth &amp; meditate.  Evenings: brush teeth, meditate, journal. * Pay bills. * Plan vacation. * Go to the gym 3x this week. * Break down chores by days so I can have 'a day off with my darling' before he leaves. * **Start** *[something]*. “Spend 5 minutes on writing my paper.”  *** ## *It’s now easier to respond!

My insurance does not cover psychiatry (but does cover primary care and a decent amount of specialist fields, though as stated, not psychiatry) but I want to seek treatment for my ADHD. I *may* be able to provide proof of it as I was diagnosed as a child and I could possibly be able to get the documentation.
38bb16ae3d6a1c95c2ddc618139427592d99955078d5f45ad0c02cfda141d365;;;First appointment on friday...;;;Hey guys! Not sure why I'm here exactly, advice I guess or just somewhere to express myself.  A couple months ago I looked into finding a good doctor that specializes in diagnosing adult adhd so I contacted the local adhd society and they pointed me in the right direction. I ended up picking up a stack of required tests and questionnaires from his clinic and within a week had submitted them. Few weeks pass by and I get a call saying he would like to see me and made an appointment for what felt like a century away. That appointment is this friday. All I know is I have to sit down with him and talk for an hour and a half (worst nightmare) and then I'm not sure what happens from there, if anything. Thing is, the closer I get to the appointment the more I doubt myself. Anyone else feel that way leading up? I'm getting pretty stressed out about it and I guess I feel like if he concludes that there's nothing wrong with me, that I'm destined to forever be a failure. I almost feel like I'm making it all up in my head and was just always lazy in school or something and now I'm just making excuses and he's gonna see riiiiight through me.  I'm female, 26 and dropped out of school in grade 10 and most people I come across seem to think I'm sharp as a tack, no ones ever questioned my graduating and I let them all assume I have. I'd like to make that a reality and move on to bigger things and not secretly feel I'm beneath others.   I've re-read this like ten times and I can't decide if it makes sense or if there's any real point to it but I'm going to submit it anyway and see what happens...

37f41c8c1be258c9d5f18c6bd5b424200c19300aaedfb7967490995e7617a199;;;Event Organizer;;;Ever since I got diagnosed back in mid-April and consequently started Vyvanse, things have been good and looking to get better. Some serious things have changed, but the biggest is this: I am organizing an event.  The story goes like this- this summer I started working at my church and became familiar with a local non-profit called She Has a Name, which fights against human and sex trafficking in Ohio. I figured after awhile that I could organize a unicycle charity ride and fundraise in order to spread awareness of the problem and people who are trying to combat it. I pitched it to my 'boss' and he loved it.   Yesterday I sat down and for 4 hours made a rather well thought out and detailed goals list, action plan, calender, designated gmail and google voice account, then read up on long-distance unicycling and supplies. I now have SMART deadlines and a plan to follow through.  Before my diagnosis this would've been impossible. I stopped a second yesterday to reflect and laughed. I'm a new man. Thanks to this community, and if you're reading this and on the fence about talking to a professional about your symptoms, just do it. One of the most positive life choices  you can make.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Is medication the only treatment of ADHD?;;;So I started reading up on medical journals and professional discussion s on ADHD. I think the general consensus among professional neurologists are the fact that there are no currently observed physical abnormalities and therefore ADHD cannot be an illness that should be treated with medications. 'They' blame theEnglish class room for the disorder, not any physiology abnormality.   This is kind of provoking to me.   I haven't been diagnosed yet and have not taken any medications for my self-diagnosed severe ADHD.   Are there alternative treatments to ADHD?   Are there cognitive behavior exercises I can do to see if it has any sort of impact on my attention?   Looking back in life I noticed patterns and waves of less ADHD and more ADHD -- Has anyone else observed this? What causes this in that case?   Also another observation about myself, my inability to get stuff done stems partly from wanting to get done as soon as possible, having the sense that time is always running out, that I have to go, now... NOW! Is there a way to slow down time, to not care about when it's done?
6b2e20eee69e1a74e97d285b9c9287e872389d8e2a2fcbfac4ffe29cb0f72430;;;Lack of ability to have a proper conversation with anybody, I just can't focus. Lots of ruined relationships.;;;I should start by saying I'm not on medication yet, got another month to go before I start on it.  I've started to notice lately that I can't have a proper conversation with anybody, or empathize with their problems as a direct result of that.  I'm so spacey that I will literally drift off within 5 seconds of someone initiating a conversation with me, and it's making me appear as really cold towards others (can't blame them for thinking that though).  The worst part of it is, I seem to have developed some sort of mental "Auto-pilot" that allows me to carry conversations, albeit in a very stiff manner, without actually mentally processing what others say to me.  I'll be off in the perpetual fog that is my mind, yet I can still subconsciously react to conversational cues.  For example:  **Them:** How was your day?   **Me:** Not bad, yours?   **Them:** Pretty good, I got X and Y done at work.   **Me:** Oh, that's good.  How're things with person x?   Etc. etc.  Meanwhile, the whole time I've interpreted nothing of what they've said.  I've had 5 minute back-and-forth conversations with others, and end up asking them afterwards what exactly we were talking about.  This usually confuses the shit out of people because I was staring them in the eyes the whole time and was actually talking/asking questions specific to whatever the topic was.  I present myself as very much normal, but in my head everything's a mess.  I'm usually thinking about something that happened earlier, or I picked up on a word that the person said and am making a thousand different mental connections about it while they progress in the conversation.  A direct result of the above is that I can't empathize well with others.  Somebody comes to me telling me they've had a rough day?  I'm mentally checked out, and listened to maybe 20% of what they've said.  I hate that I do this, especially with the people I actually care about, but I simply can't focus on a conversation, regardless of how dire the situation is.  I've tuned out when people are talking about a relative that just died, and I hate myself in those moments.  I try my hardest to snap myself back to listen, but it rarely works.  Anyways, I was wondering if anybody else experiences this sort of thing while unmedicated.  Did medication help you to be able to focus on others?  I've honestly put my dating life on hold because of the above problems; my last few relationships ended because I was so mentally (and therefore, emotionally) distant, and it's not fair for me to put others through that.  **TL;DR: Can't focus on conversations with anybody, regardless of how close I am with them, and it has ruined a lot of otherwise great relationships.  Wondering if others have had similar experiences in the past.**
ffe2c9afd68f9b2593097edd9b0667af67dbf91bbfac703689791714fbecd30f;;;No meds yet....feeling down...and venting;;;Had my last assessment appointment yesterday.  Doctor says that I definitely have ADHD.    However there is just one more appointment before I can get meds.  Have to have a physical check-up to make sure its safe to do so.    Of course I am all for this.  I do have a bit of high blood pressure and I do want to make sure its safe to be on stimulants for sure.    So I go to make the appointment, figuring it will be next week....but its actually more than a month from now.  Doctor is away for vacation it sounds like or just fully booked.    I felt like crying.  I'm just so down.  I'm on vacation right now from work for the next month, I can BARELY function when I'm not working.   When I am working life is so bad that I'm incredibly suicidal every day.    I so badly wanted to use my month off to start medication and to try and pull together so much stuff that I just can't do.  I thought how it would be easier without having to work.  I've already been off for a while and without meds been trying to pull stuff together...trying my fucking hardest actually....and its just....not even close to good enough.  So now I'm sad.  My hopes for doing that while not working are gone.  Its always a struggle.  This whole thing for me has been a fight from the beginning, its been since November and I had to fight everyone (except this one Dr.) to get help for what I knew was ADHD.  Then another month of diagnosis....and now this.    I'm tired of fighting.  I'm just fucking sick of it at this point.  I will keep going, trying to pull life together...and I'm sure I will keep falling down...but I have no other choice but to keep going.    At least my Dr. is awesome, he is willing to treat the ADHD "first," if its what I want.  I don't believe I'm going to bother treating the depression or anxiety at all to be honest.  My depression has gotten to the point where if I was functional I'd be content.  I don't care that I have anxiety.  Everything else in life is so much worse....who even fucking cares.   Oh and then theres the fact that there is a possiblity that I can't even go on stimulants....becuase of high blood pressure....which could probably be solved if I could just get myself to exercise even fucking twice a week and eat better....but of course I can barely brush my fucking teeth.    Sure I'm depressed as fuck...but when EVERYTHING is a constant struggle and you can't even think straight because thoughts wont stop and its gone on since as far back as you can remember then OF COURSE you will be depressed.  Its fuckign exhausting and all for nothing.    I love my Dr. and I know he will help me.  I'm grateful to even have the diagnosis at this point.  I'm grateful to be working with someone who is so willing to work with me and what I want too.  I'm grateful that my Dr. is truly brilliant (he is very very intelligent) and I believe geniunely wants to see me and others do well.    There is a lot of good.  And a month isn't that long when I consider how many YEARS I wasted on trying to fix my problems not even knowing about ADHD.  But I'm still sad.  I'm still tired.  I want to be able to do things without struggling so damn much.  And of course I don't even know that stimulants will help.  I know they won't do it all for me....but I just need fuckigns omething to HELP.    And life just won't stop.  Things just keep happening that need to be dealt with and I can't do it.  I can't even take care of myself and all my energy goes towards trying to do so.  Trying to just do the bare minimum...and if I can do that, I have to be proud of myself because its still a huge improvement.    Sometimes I think its not even worth it.    Whatever....back to making my stupid cue card task list thing I've come up with in hopes of making tasks more straight forward.  Just so sick of trying so hard with very little end reward.    TL;DR  Finally got ADHD diagnosis.  No meds until next appointment which is now just over a month away.  Am off work until that appointment day and am sad because I was hoping to get meds and try to pull things together while being off work.  :(  Tired of everything being a struggle in some way.
f2a4c192424e0f346cb4975d116ae9bc8cb90f368615367b237686590e47a0f4;;;Advice on Reaching the Correct Dosage;;;Hello all, Within the last two months I was diagnosed with Combined ADHD and began taking medicine. I started with Adderall XR at 30mg and I felt all the wonderful help this medicine gives people who suffer from ADHD. After a few weeks, that effect went away. I told my doctor this and he increased my dosage to 60mg and asked of I wanted to try Vyvanse. I said yes, because he mentioned it was stronger. Unfortunately, I feel nothing from Vyvanse at 60mg. I am just frustrated that I have to go higher in dosage. From what I understood from my doctor, once you hit the right dosage it will click and the medicine will be effective. But anything below that will be ineffective. Has anyone else experienced this process of finding the right dose? Any advice on what to look for with myself or explain to my doctor when I go in again?
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;ADHD-PI and life;;;Hello everyone!  I was just wondering if anyone else could relate to what I go through on a daily basis with ADHD-PI (or the two other versions of ADHD).  I don't struggle with recognizing emotions, I struggle with matching them. I can always tell when someone is sad, happy, or angry. I'd even go as far to say that I'm fairly decent at predicting what's going to happen based on the mannerisms that a person is exhibiting. However, my problem lies with being emotional when anyone comes to me with a problem or accomplishment. I can feign emotions quite well, but it's quite rare when I actually do feel something. Also, the few times that it's happened, I don't know how to deal with them and whatever I'm feeling is painted all over my face  and I can't hide it at all.   Also, before taking medication, I struggled with everything that didn't have a goal that I could see outright. For example, I played soccer in high school because I could see the ball and see the goal, but I couldn't even fathom why people did cross country because those runners were competing against a clock and had to run miles before seeing the finish line. I bring this up because I think it's a perfect analogy for how I performed academically. I knew the goal was to get into a good college, but I couldn't see it immediately so I didn't really try. Just putting it out there, I scored in the 95th percentile for the ACT and the SAT, yet I graduated highschool with a cum. GPA of 2.5.  I've also always struggled with dating. It's hard to convince myself to actually go after someone because of issues with self esteem (although I'm in pretty decent shape). And then when I do, I lose interest, particularly when it's become fairly obvious that she likes me back..it's quite frustrating.   A little bit about me, I'm 22 years old, got diagnosed with ADHD-PI just a year ago, and I'm currently taking 36 mg Concerta once a day. I can honestly say the medicine is fantastic and has changed my life in terms of patience, grades, and paying attention in classes (rarely do I fall asleep during lectures). Also, if anyone is looking for a good app for exercising (running has always been super boring for me and I just never feel like doing it for extended periods), I'd like to recommend 'Zombies Run!' and 'Zombies: 5k'. It's got a storyline to it and has helped me stay motivated in running on a regular basis. Cheers! Thanks for reading/replying!  TL;DR I have ADHD-PI, was wondering if people struggle with motivation, emotion, dating and things like that. Also, would be interested in finding out any tips you use to focus, adjust, and deal with ADHD-PI without medication  edit: My family pediatrician suspected I had ADHD-PI when I was in 8th grade but my parents brushed it off because one of my teachers said I was just being lazy and it was my fault for my grades (interestingly enough, if you look at my GPA, you'd see me learning how to compensate over the years, 1.5 in middle school, 2.0 going into HS, 2.5 graduating HS, 3.0 in college). I thought that might be an interesting tidbit to add
b30c54949da0ec674376f4be8e1a1478439c78fd1a6d920829d934c533008b12;;;I need help picking a new med!;;;So for about 2 months I was started on 50mg Vyvanse which helped a lot. I got a lot more work done and started developing good habits when I wasn't taking it. My room was cleaner, I could finish work much faster, and it wasn't the feeling of taking a drug.    After that two months, my families insurance changed to where we had to pay anywhere from $50-$160 for medication, unless it was generic. Since Vyvanse was $160/mo, I asked my doctor for a new generic medication, and he prescribed me Generic Focalin IR.   I was a little confused since Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine) and Focalin (dexmethylphenidate) have many differences, such as the chemical makeup and a huge difference in how long they last. I take Focalin 2 times a day, and it ends up being around 9-10 hours long, which fixed that confusion a little bit.   I like the fact that having the IR version gives me more of a choice when to take it since it works faster and lasts shorter, as opposed to with Vyvanse it would be strong for about 4 hours and I would slowly notice it wearing off. With the 2x a day, as soon as I notice it wearing off, I can take another which makes it more constant throughout the day.    The downside is Focalin is that it does feel more like a drug and is harder to focus on it. I feel like I need to be moving to get stuff done and its hard to sit down and for example do something like reading.   I know Concerta and Ritalin come in generic versions but are also methylphenidates like Focalin, where as the amphetamine based medications help me more. I would like to ask for generic Adderall or Dexedrine but my psychiatrist told me he rarely prescribes those though as they are more abused and more addicting.   I don't want to try another methylphenidate like Focalin, but I don't think he'll prescribe me either of the only 2 amphetamine based Generic medications.   What meds helped you guys the best? Or what is the best generic medication? Has anyone gone through anything similar?    *TLDR; I liked Vyvanse, Focalin feels more speedy, but I need generic med

If i take it straight for about 2 weeks there comes a point where it feels like it's not working as well and then comes the sore body/joints/bones. The feeling is like when you have a really bad flu and you just feel like you got hit by a semi truck. Has anyone experienced similar side effects and is there anything I can do? I'm scared to proceed with it for a prolonged amount of time.  I've already spoke with my doctor about it but she says to keep trying it and if it persists than she will put me on adderall.

Wondering about others in the medical field and how it affects your job.  I now know why it's so hard for me to get everything done at work. And why my colleagues make it looks easier, thus making me feel incompetent.   3 years ago I was told I should be evaluated for ADD by my manager and the Chief Intensivist due to poor performance and to help secure my job. I saw a psychiatrist and psychologist and was told I had "low focus" and co-dependency but not ADD.   Now, I've been diagnosed by my therapist who is familiar with the differences of ADD in Women and just by telling her about my job and issues, she said it sounded just like it. After reading about Women and ADD, it hit me like a ton of bricks. I fit the description 100%. My life and it's idiosyncrasies suddenly make sense now. I cried my eyes out when I figured it out because life could have been so much easier 3 years ago. Fucking "professionals".   I just don't know who talk with about it , other than my husband and therapist. I have a strong urge to tell everybody to explain why I'm awkward and weird. That might make it worse though. ;)

Most are fine but one in particular has ADHD. I have a hard time having him listen to me. He has certain triggers that will send him into HUGE fits of screaming. I have noticed that he likes to be in charge. If you tell him something is different than what he thinks it is, he will get worked up. Another trigger I have found is that if you accuse him of something he didn't do or thinks he didn't do, he will start screaming that you don't trust him. When this happens, I kneel down and literally get on his level and calmly have him explain the situation, tell him what I am going to do, and we go from there.      But there are times when the situation isn't severe enough for me to do that. Like today, he wouldn't sit down and eat his lunch, he found a toy he liked much better. I finally "Herded" him over to the lunch table and a more seasoned staff yelled at him until he sat down. I don't want to use that as my default. So far, I have been told that I am one of the two staff there that he listens to. So, my question is, how do I get him to listen to me without yelling at him all while respecting his disorder? Any help is appreciated!     **TL;DR**: A boy a work with has ADHD, how do I discipline/get him to listen while respecting his disorder and without shouting?

I'm getting "evicted" from my place of residence for about the 27th time.;;;I've been ADHD/ADD since I was starting school.  I(26) (and my boyfriend(34)) think that he might be ADD as well.  We keep having arguments that escalate, and when we've had conversations about the conflicts when sober, we've tried to provide suggestions to each other as to handle the other when we get into one of those highly introverted, almost manic modes.   Last night, we were drunk, and he started doing that thing he does where he needs to listen to music, loudly, with bass, until fuck you o'clock.  I needed to sleep.  I did what he had suggested when we last had this conflict.   I grabbed my good headphones and handed them to him as I requested that he enjoy the music through a means that doesn't rattle the walls.  He tore them apart, threw them at me, and then shit escalated.  I'm leaving out the finer points of my trying to calm him down, and the finer points of the holes in the walls.  For the umpteenth time, I'm chilling at the bar down the road because I can't go "home".  I don't know what to do, I don't really have the money to move right now, but I don't think I can keep trying to do all of the harder things he asks of me (helping him cleaning up the disaster that his previous roommate left behind and helping with other general home renovations), when really all I ask of him at this point is to stop leaving clothes in the dryer (they're still there... It's been a week... So much for me helping with other laundry chores, if his shit that he only likes folded a certain way is still fucking sitting there).  So, I'm getting thrown out, because what was a simple request to wear headphones turned into him breaking them, throwing the pieces at me, me chucking them back... etc. until he grabbed the lamp I was holding to defend myself and baseball bat smashed it against the wall.    What the hell can I do?  According to him, I'm a psycho abusive nut.  According to me, it's a little ridiculous that breaking my shit and throwing it at me is ok, but if I throw it back, I'm abusive and assaulting him.  Help?

I hardly do anything during my day, not even the things I enjoy, simply because I cannot keep myself happy. Everyday is a constant struggle to keep myself happy or motivated however I can, but it just doesn't work. I've been trying my whole life to keep a schedule, to be stable in SOMETHING, ANYTHING, to have some sort of routine, something I can count on everyday, nothing has stuck. I live in my own head and I'm terrified there's something seriously wrong with me. I have no talents or skills, I've never stuck with anything long enough to master it.    Is there anything I can do?

My older brother was diagnosed as a child, way back when ADD was a barely known disorder. After my parents spent a lot of money on testing he was finally prescribed ritalin and his situation improved dramatically. When my parents noticed the same behavior in me, they realized I had the same thing, and didn't want to spend money to get me tested. My Dad is a doctor, so he was able to get ritalin pretty easily. They didn't keep me on it, however, because I complained about it making me "feel weird". This was in middle school.  I'm 34 years old, and up until now I've been just dealing with it the best way I know how. I got just good enough grades to graduate with a bachelor's degree. Still, I've always struggled with it. My ex-wife had always called me a "space cadet" or "dead head". I've never been able to finish a book. I could read through 5 pages and have no idea what I've just read, even though part of my brain was actually reading. My distractions are all internal.  -- end backstory --  Anyhow, I am now self employed and recently realized I needed help when I could tell my productivity was plummeting. It always seemed like my brain was in an infinite loop and I could barely finish a project. So, last time I visited home in KS (I live in TX) my Dad wrote me a script for Adderall just to try it out. I had to fill in KS b/c I have to fill in the same state.   After being on it for 3 weeks, the difference it's made in my life is jaw-dropping. The best way I can describe it is that I just feel normal. One thing I did not expect is how it would effect my social interactions. I can actually have conversations with perfect strangers now.  Now that I'm about to run out, I'm not sure that I can keep getting prescriptions from my Dad since he's in a different state. I'm also currently searching for a new primary care doc. How can I maximize my chances of finding a doctor that will be ok with giving me a prescription?

Three medications. long post warning.;;;NOTE: don't judge the medication solely on what I say everyone reacts differently this is just my experience. With these medications I try giving two day to dosage level as I adjust up and down to gauge the effectiveness.   Well holy goat soaked shit weasels.      Was that enough of an intro to get you into a what the hell mood? I have been dealing with ADHD for about 33 years now and I have had many trials and tribulation with it and spend most of that time coming up with personal coping mechanisms to adjust to it. I tend to be a rather introspective person and am in a generally consistent state of self analysis. I have also had a lot of personal outside learning classes and such and read like mad, cause I am a bit of a nerd. I also have a lousy keyboard that needs to be replaced soon and so if I misspell a lot or go off on little tangents please bear with me. (yeah like all of us don't do this.) Okay, so my son in now seven and I am seeing him in a light like my own past glaring at me and shaking it's finger and I want to do all I can to make his life better than mine. After years of having given up on doctors and medications to help with what I believe is just how I am wired I decided to do what I can with me before I put my kid through any of that, and I though this might be a worthwhile thing to share if it can help anyone else in a similar situation.(my new medication I also think is helping to compel me as well) In around June I decided after my child had a rather "okay" year at school, that maybe it is time to see what I can do to make life better for him, me, and my wife whom I can now see is in the same fix and is probably the root reason she can keep up with me.        Here we go. I went to my doc and asked point blank about aderall and ADHD.(little more of a back story but in the interest of time bear with it). He had said that the standard operating procedure about that kind of stuff is to talk to a psychologist first, get an assessment and then talk to a psychiatrist and pursue medication and treatment from there. Well all that done I was given aderall to deal with my ADHD (probably C, but high functioning). Here we get into the Goldilocks story. I tried Aderall for a while and I was better able to focus and interact with others and the world, I felt safer in traffic and performed better at work. Then there was the side effects mostly on the come down: Tight jaw a need to constantly clench my teeth and chew on something (gum, wire coating sleeve, zip tie ends) also not so much mood swing as much as flat out grumpy anger, and headaches. I found that the headache was due to a lack of caffine and had to get off that gradually to reduce caffine withdrawls. Aderall I would say is the Drill instructor it will make you perform and do your duty and ride you hard and put you away sore and tired.      So I e-mailed my doc and we decided to try ridalin or the off brand kind anyways. This one I didn't take to well at all. I always felt just wrong. I felt like my head was in a fog and I was slow tired and just bogged down. I was also developing a cold and that didn't help it much either. Still I was not doing well on the medication. Coworkers noticed and my wife even made note that I was just zoned and zonked out on this one.(my wife is helping me gauge the medication from outside perspective). So I stuck with it for only a week and it just seem to make things actively worse, I had lower attention span and keeping things in mind, problem keeping to a schedule and remembering task or even at times what I was doing in  the moment. Ritalin I would call the mugger it shows up cleans you clock and leave you in the gutter.      So I e-mailed my doc and we had a little a little back and for about the medications and whether or not to try a non-stimulant. I am scared of them flat out. I seem to have a higher than normal sensitivity to drugs that interact with the brain in that fashion. I had a back experience with Topemax for cluster headaches out of the blue a few year ago and it left me a blank robotic stuttering and hi-strung mess. I still can remember most of the three month I was on it. (sucks too apparently some cool stuff happened according to my wife and I wish I could remember or at least been "present" at the time) Well for now I am not going to have anything to due with the non-stimulants.      Dexatrine was the next one up to the plate and my current champion. I have not been on it very long so far and I have just moved up to I believe 15mg 3xpills and I am usually taking them at 7-11-4. Well it started off bumpy. I was on 2x pills and had a mild improvement nothing to noticeable but I was putting it through its paces. Doing alright at work, unlike aderall I was speaking a bit better not so fast or stumbling over my words so much. (also still have the cold, ugh). All in all it seem like a soft touch no real harsh come down and no need to chew excessively. But man I could just lock on and go at work, and was better able to handle the constant interruptions and task switching that goes with it. Today I got up late and don't normally dose on the weekends but I had some work to do and wanted to be on task with it. Today I started the 3x dosage and man it is a whole new world. I am up and going and on point, I feel sharp and finely tuned. I wouldn't say I am euphoric but I can definitely saw i am walking in the same neighborhood. I feel more driven and man I am just happy to be me. I took a shower and it felt great, I saw myself in the mirror and yeah I look alight, and when I got dressed it felt nice. I got to start cleaning the house but I wanted to write this stuff down first and holy fuck weasels I got it done, now let see if I can follow through and post it and get to cleaning up the house.        Analyse yourself and talk with your doc, get a medication that make you feel better, you got this for life find out what works best and change it up if it doesn't do you right. Don't settle just to get along it's you life and livelihood and it's your body. Don't let the doc just tell you what to do, work with them because they just have practice and standard procedure, only you have first hand knowledge of you. ADHD is not a cure and isn't really a problem, it only seem like it because of others outside looking in. So don't medicate to feel normal do it to feel functional and be better. I am still ADHD but now I can break off enough attention to deal with "normal" people. The way I see it, lap them and catch up that way, don't just hobble yourself cause they are so far behind. Sorry if I sound like a born again, but let you flag fly.

(disinhibition, organizational difficulties, distractible)  I did not take meds until college. Freshman and sophomore year I was a pot head and I never really took the meds daily due to my irregular lifestyle. I used them only for certain lectures or days where I needed to get a lot done.  I have really been interested in learning a lot about my diagnosis this last year since quitting weed. (officially I have not smoked since mid-june, but the amount of weed drastically decreased since last fall)  Anyway, my doctor knows about my prior substance abuse issues. I was so excited to visit him to bring up all the challenges I have been having with ADHD and how I can benefit from medication. On the side I have been going to an ADHD support group, reading books and articles, ect.  However, I feel like I must have looked like the most drug-hungry person alive during my appointment. I have tried and failed at various behavioral therapy approaches and I know that medication will help me get over the hump. Yes, I am drug-seeking. But by the end of the 30 minutes I had with my psych I never really touched on any of the topics I wanted to discuss. I went off on tangents during the conversation and the doctor really did not ask many questions since I was dominating it. I told him so many things that are undoubtebly red flags (I had thought loops the other night in which I thought about what I would say during this appointment, I have roommates that all smoke, my roommate is a drug dealer, I offered to be drug tested today, I used to sell felony quantities of weed) - Somehow I ended up saying all these things, which are true...and I was not trying to lie.  The end result of the conversation was that the doctor very hesitantly mentioned that I will "maybe" be able to get back on medication in the future. (in which I questioned the "maybe" immediately)  I was SO PISSED OFF when he said "Oh, it doesn't seem like you are struggling in school", while indicating that I had above a 3.0 GPA...That absolutely set me off because I look at ADHD affecting all facets of my life, including school.....Being typical of an ADDer, instead of addressing my actual issues with studying, I reverted back to a previous discussion in which I did not get my final word in.  I don't even know what I am saying on here right now. I guess every time I talk to the doctor I want to have a plan but it gets so disrupted by my spur-of-the-moment thinking and logic. I feel as if he doesn't understand or follow that I am trying to prove to him that I am not abusing any drugs currently and that I will use a stimulant medication the right way, which, in essence, is what a person would do that is just trying to get uppers for recreational use....   My psych briefly reviews my file before each meeting and we seemingly have no rapport. (he was 20 minutes late to this last meeting so I was already angry)  I do not know how to approach my next consultation.  *It's important to note that I just came off of Lamictal (a mood stablizer). I had an episode of mania that my psych has concluded was most likely because of the weed and not from an actual BP diagnosis.  TL;DR- I come off as an irresponsible drug abuser, when I have truly changed and want to convince my doctor I am in the right mindset.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;My opinion on ADHD (I want to hear your opinion too);;;"ADHD is characterized by significant difficulties either of inattention and/or hyperactivity and impulsiveness."  I feel as if inattention in certain respects is not a bad thing. I feel as if it is actually a good thing. Why? Because attention, when one has inattention, is given only to the basic, more important things. BUT with the way society is organized today, inattention is labeled as bad. The "basic, more important things" such as feeding oneself and maintaining a home for oneself is satisfied in a trivial way (grocery stores, apartment buildings) so individuals can pursue difficult educations and learnings in fields that satisfy our industrial-technological system we live in. These educations and learnings are simply unnatural, and this is why we need prescription drugs and doctors telling us that we have problems that were never seen years and years ago. People with inattention are living for themselves and the local community, and this is not acceptable in a world where engineering, math, and science must take incessant leaps forward.  Well, now let's check out hyperactivity. This is another thing that is not bad whatsoever. Just because the modern day calls for a sedentary being, propped in front of a book or computer screen, does not mean that having loads of energy is a bad thing. This is another case of what is convenient for the society we live in today. Society calls for a person who can spend long hours not exerting themselves physically, perhaps sitting in front of a computer programming, or stationed in a lab running tests on who knows what, and furthermore, if you look back in history, it is undeniable that man was active - way more active than today. Maybe high levels of energy is a trait from the past that we are "struggling" with today. I'm not exactly sure how I feel about impulsiveness, maybe I'll formulate an opinion and post it in the comments.  I have been taking Adderall consistently for quite a while, and I have tried all of the other ADHD medicines out there. I feel as if I take Adderall to function as the ideal, "good" member of society. I feel as if I take it to drive myself to do the things I don't really have any interest in doing if I wasn't on the pill because I know I can get by with a mediocre life living off of the government, so why bother exerting myself. Path of least resistance, right? I feel as if Adderall changes my state to make me more willing to stoop to a demoralizing level and work hard for a paycheck - to take the path of not-least resistance. Actually, I'm pretty certain of this. I can definitely say that Adderall makes me an obedient member of society, when I don't truly even want to be one, but I'm tricking myself into it when I take the pill. I think this is why an overwhelming, incredible amount of people take these drugs... just to serve the societal system we live in today... the industrial society that has been erected by the wealthy. We are drugged up slaves, made comfortable by the drugs! And finally, I feel as if when I take Adderall, I'm doing something that is good for the society we live in today, the society we are all supposed to be a part of and do good for, and I am not necessarily doing something good for myself when I take Adderall.  This is just how I feel. Thank you for reading. I would like to see what you all have to say about this.  TL;DR - We are slaves to the system. We are told we have problems, when we in fact do not have problems... and then we are drugged up to serve the industrial society we live in. [See here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1fiq7a/an_extreme_circumstance/) as an example of people with ADHD coping just fine. We are a part of the greatest lie that we have issues. These issues only exist because of the societal stresses imposed on us. In 2008, 4/10 Americans were on prescription drugs, 5 years later today, 7/10 Americans are. The saddest thing is I'm right there with those 7/10 Americans (using small numbers makes it seem not-so-bad...) so I should instead say that I'm right there with those +200,000,000 Americans... do I like it? ABSOLUTELY NOT!!! But do I feel obligated to take the drugs? Sadly, yes. I guess we're all just going to be pill popping robots until we retire.

I’m scared of the typical things people are scared of such as heights and needles. I’m scared of the not so common things such as not knowing how to do something or not living up to the expectations of those for whom I perform (TBH, sometimes I have trouble remembering what I’m actually like). What I’m scared of the most? Being different - being like everyone else.    For as long as I can remember, I've been the guy who forgets about his homework assignment until he’s walking into class, the guy who, when approaching his friends of 3+ years of daily interaction, forgets their names completely, the one who can’t remember what you said to him 10 minutes ago as he was walking from the lunchroom to class. I've been normal. I wasn’t no fool, however, and I knew that my normal wasn't everyone else’s normal.    Half-way through my senior year in high school, I found this neat little corner of the internet filled with people incredibly like me. The next logical step would be to interact and get the support backing of this community, but instead I did the internet version of running away – I closed the tab and ignored the subreddit. I was scared of the truth. I was scared that if I got the community backing and support, I would slowly become different – and that terrified me. I didn’t know how to handle different, I didn’t have coping mechanisms for different, I didn’t have a ‘routine’ for different.    One day it sort of just hit me.  I was awake late into the morning (much as I am now) and had gotten lost in my mind (nothing good on reddit(yay for getting 700ish posts in on /r/all) or YouTube anymore) and decided to give /r/adhd another peek. I started reading some of the all-time top posts and I realized that all of the sudden I had been crying – not because I was scared or upset – because I was actually happy. I felt like I had found ‘home’. Reading a bit more about other people I finally decided to give thinking about getting help a chance.  So after a lot of contemplating (and tons of note-taking so-as not to forget) when my first paycheck hits from my new job (delivery driver for Domino's) I’ll be starting to process of getting diagnosed and hopefully on the track to become a different me. I’m scared but hopefully it’ll work out.

(not completely due to ADHD, she just got a house and has major depression issues, so it just worked out better this way for now) I've been job hunting for a couple months, and I just got my first callback for an interview with a life insurance company.  It's not really something I've ever really considered, I just put my number down at a job fair, so I'm a little skeptical that it's even a real job and not just a way to sell me or something.   Any advice is welcome: Interview/sales/insurance, I need it all!  PS  I'm down to my last two adderall.... I've been rationing it for 3 months. I'll take one before my interview and hopefully be able to get a little money for a refill before (hopefully) starting the job.

Recently, I have been talking to my pediatrician regarding medication. He recommended me first trying to take caffeine in the morning as a mild stimulant to see the effect. He recommended a simple non-prescription 100mg pill in the morning, and doubling the dose if no results are apparent.    I took 1 pill every other day for a week with no results. However, when I took 200mg I felt less creative, and slightly more able to focus. For several hours I lost the ability to daydream, which was strange because I always like to do so at my job when work slows down. I felt like a machine, ticking away. It felt very strange for the first time. The focusing effect was very mild, compared to my lack of creativity. Overall, I do not know how much it would help me in my daily life.    Has anyone else's doctor recommended this? If so, what is the next step? I have an appointment with my doctor tomorrow, but I don't have any other observations to go back to him with other than these experiences.  Thanks for your help :)

I forget about assignments outside of class constantly, and when I do remember them I procrastinate so badly to the point where I don't even get it done, I just worry about it. I always worry about everything. Sometimes I can't sleep at night because I have anxiety from thinking about really embarrassing moments of the past (recent and distant). Embarrassment scares the living hell out of me. Almost every single embarrassing story I have is because I had said something outlandish, stupid, or it may have seemed normal to me but nobody else.  It wasn't until almost a year ago that I started reading about ADHD and all the symptoms. I related to quite a few of them. I finally talked to my mother about it, but she thought I was batshit crazy. She has worked with kids for almost 30 years now, so she claims she would have known a very long time ago if I had any disorders or not. I finally went to my college's counseling center a few months after that to talk to someone about my anxiety. I wasn't going with the mindset of ADHD, only for anxiety and depression. After a few appointments she said that she saw many signs of ADD and ADHD. I quit going because I just felt like the only person who could help me was myself. I tried getting on a diet and working out, but I just get so unmotivated to do something if I don't find interest in it (eating tuna and canned chicken every day really gets old). I'm debating on finally going to see a doctor about it, but I'm terrified of being diagnosed with something. I have tried Vyvanse and Adderall before. Vyvanse is a wonder drug for me. I can sit there and happily listen to someone, be completely calm, focus on whatever is in front of me, and just be happy. I didn't like Adderall because of the side effects (made me jittery and what not).  My parents basically pay for everything, but it's time for me to start helping them out. When I go back to college for this fall I will be working and going to school. I can't physically see myself commuting to school 30 minutes away from where I will be living, while having a job at the same time. I literally can't see myself pulling through 100% with that. I just don't know how to approach my parents or a doctor/psychiatrist about my situation. I'm just afraid everyone will see me as a drug-seeker and not as a person who really needs it. I get told by my friends that I'm normal and don't need a drug to help me, but I know I need to get some help. Sorry for this ridiculously long rant, I just needed some like-minded people to hear me out and give me some advice. Thank you.

We always get the male perspective, what is yours?;;;The other thread regarding ideas for a book got me to thinking that we don't really self-identify the women of this forum with ADHD.  ADHD is so often presented as a male issue, especially with hyperactivity. With a few exceptions, we women tend to be daydreamers. We're mostly PI, although some of us can be Combined. (I am, due to being inattentive and also impulsive, but *not* hyperactive at all.)  Please tell us about yourself? What's your diagnosis? Do you fit the "female ADHD" mold of PI, or do you break it with some good ol' fashioned hyperactivity?  What meds are working for you? Which have not? How have you handled meds and your pregnancy, if you've had children? I was surprised to read that one woman noticed her menstrual cycle included several days where, due to hormonal reasons, her ADHD meds just don't work. Do you notice that too?  We're rather different from the majority male ADHD folks. What do you think contributes to a unique female perspective? Would you be interested in a /r/adhdwomen group or something like that?   I'd like to just hear from us ladies. I always feel so alone in having this disorder. It's just not *diagnosed*, don't you know? People look at me like I'm crazy because I'm so *not* hyper. What are your experiences? Please chime in.  **EDIT:** Probably the most participatory thread I've ever created. Thank you! Keep 'em coming! I'm trying to read/upvote everything. It blew up after I went to sleep.   Also, I have learned that many of you are indeed quite hyperactive. I never realized that. I thought by and large we XX'ers were PI daydreamers. I see a lot of myself in some of these comments. It's really awesome to know I'm not alone. I do the "default Reddit gender assumption" thing a lot, so I never realized how many women were replying/posted in threads here.

Do you agree? Do you disagree? Do you think the terminology change is significant? Anything else?  ~  ~  In [DSM]-IV, there were 3 ADHD subtypes: I'm sure everyone here knows them well. PH, PI, and combined.  ~  ~  In [DSM-5](http://www.psychiatry.org/practice/dsm) {May 2013}: *ADHD* is a single disorder. *Subtypes* do not apply to ADHD. Subtypes have been replaced by *presentations that specify current symptoms* dictated by the prevalent symptoms of the last 6 months. " Because symptoms can change over time, *presentations* may change over time as well "(DSM 5).  ~  ~  **My opinion:** I think the terminology is well worded. I think it makes ADHD more legitimate to Non-ADHD'rs. According to DSM-IV, I was "ADHD PI". According to DSM-IV, I am "ADHD". Based on my last 6 months my ADHD would be considered as having a "Predominantly Inattentive Presentation". However, the presentation is subject to change over my life. I was definitely a "Combined Presentation" when I was 8 lol :p.   _  Reference:  *  [DSM 5 ADHD Section](http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/diagnosis.html) : American Psychiatric Association: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision.

It was apparent even during the testing that my working memory is really bad.  When I mention it to my mother her response is "oh... you remember more than you think you do."  I am so tired of family dismissing this even when neuro testing shows a deficit.  It makes me want to not even talk to them anymore ... it's like they just dismiss the ADHD crap that I have to live with.

I am now in my mid 20's and I am having some problems that I've found to be symptoms of ADHD and they are starting to interfere with my work/social life. I have been averse to getting the "stigma" of being diagnosed ever since I was a child and I still feel like I hold a bit of that. I don't know what I should do. I think a big part is just worrying what others would think and who would be able to find out... I've done pretty well despite my problems but it has taken a toll and I am worried if someone found out I needed medication then they would assume everything I've done was the result of having that extra help or something... also with future jobs / licensing - who can find out if I have been diagnosed and been receiving medication? Thanks... I guess not knowing what being diagnosed and taking medications actually means is what is stressing me out.. I know the drugs to treat this are really scrutinized and I am worried that it may have a negative impact in the future? (since there are a lot of people who do not understand the disease and if they hear about the medication just assume you were trying to abuse it?) Or am I just over-thinking..

I posted this here because I know my problems are common amongst this subreddit. Even if just one of you take the time to read this and help me out, I would be so grateful. Skip down to the asterisk (*) if you don't want to read the background. Thanks in advance.  I am a 17 year old male in my senior year of high school and have hit a block in the road that I don't know I can recover from. After a really depressive episode 4 weeks ago, I wasn't able to face life for about two weeks. I stayed in bed, lost 6 kilos, had 1 meal per day.   I was able to see a psychiatrist about 2 weeks ago, was diagnosed with ADHD, and its two most common comorbidities, anxiety and depression. The psychiatrist and I talked for about 2 hours, and he put me on an SNRI antidepressant and Concerta. Antidepressants make me insanely tired and zombie-like, Concerta is able to counter this a bit, but the ultimate result is a very unhealthy sleeping pattern.  I'm not stupid at all, in fact I am quite capable. The psych said I have the brain power of a Lamborghini Aventador with the steering system of a Honda. I just for the life of me, cannot control either my brain, or my emotions. I rapidly go from feeling so great in the morning, certain that I will fix my problems, to rock bottom at night, thinking that suicide would be a much easier way out of this.  A [video on youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua8Zm9STtKY) that I found   in another thread of Russel Barkley explaining ADHD really astounded me. It just connected so many of my problems together. The shortsightedness of my actions and their consequences. The drug problems. The comorbidities. The inattentiveness. The effects on everyday life.  Very much to my regret, by reading atheistic material by Dawkins and Hitchens, I have attained unhealthy views that I can't get rid of about how insignificant and meaningless my life is.   (*)Enough rambling. Here's my problem. I'm still depressed, the SNRIs aren't working effectively yet. The Concerta works for inattentiveness, but not for activity direction. I can't sit down and start my work. Teachers leave the discipline to us now, so it's so easy to slack off. Last night I kind of binge drank, and ended up feeling much worse. I'm in the most stressful part of the school year, and have assignments up to my ears. I've always kept myself to very high standards and feel that if I fail in life, namely not attaining a career in medicine, and having a successful marriage, then I might turn to suicide. I am already on the brink of drug dependence (weed), which makes me really scared that it's something that will tempt me throughout my whole life, and maybe turn into a method of suicide (OD on coke or heroin).   If I can't even handle myself now, in a home with a loving mother, and have the discipline to eat, sleep, and work properly, I can't see anything in my life turning out remotely okay.  I need the advice of someone who has or is still battling with similar issues. A step-by-step guide, an insightful comment, an analysis of my problems, whatever it is, any help would be great. Thanks so much.

While thinking in hindsight I can recall many episodes from my childhood that would suggest I had ADHD, those symptoms never affected my life significantly (primarily because I received much help from my parents and grandmother to deal with my daily activities). However, during the last two years I've been literally plagued by difficulties and misfortunes such as constantly missing buses, trains or (twice so far) flights and inability to handle paperwork (signing agreements, documents related to obtaining visa/residence permit, arranging accommodation etc.). I keep losing/misplacing things, procrastinating and not getting anything done until the deadline is upon me.  This month I finally decided to have a consultation with a psychiatrist. I had two consultations and in the end she said she'll refer me to the clinic where I can be tested. However, the conversations with her (as well as some research I've done to explore the nature of the test) makes me believe that there is a pretty good chance I won't be diagnosed with ADHD, even though I may well have the condition. Here are the reasons why:  1. Good academic records. It looks like they're paying too much attention to your grades. I hold master's and advanced master's degrees with cum laude and magna cum laude, respectively, which is presumably very atypical for someone with ADHD. (Although I accomplished that without going through even 20-25% of required readings and I regularly missed deadlines for submitting my papers/theses. It's just that through experience I learned how to write my papers or answer exam questions exactly the way that would please the professor. Thus I've always been a better-than-average student without putting much effort into my studies or deeply understanding the subject I was being taught).  2. There is no one who could confirm my childhood symptoms of ADHD. My parents are thousands of miles away, plus they speak neither English nor the official language of the country I'm currently residing in. (Apart from that, we've been a bit estranged since I came out as agnostic and I'd really prefer not to involve them). There are no evaluation reports from my school teachers either, since back in my schooldays this system simply didn't exist.  Thus, all I have (at least from a psychiatrist's point of view) are observations and complaints I can't substantiate. Quite the contrary, my academic records clearly contradict my account. The test, I was told, costs "a few hundred Euros" (insurance covers only part of it), requires follow-up(s) and is thus fairly time-consuming. It would be really frustrating to undergo the procedure without getting correct diagnosis. In the meantime, symptoms are becoming increasingly annoying along with my growing professional commitments and they will only get worse when I have to start teaching in late September.  So here is a question to those of you who are more familiar with the procedure: does it make any sense to show up for the medical examination alone (that is, without a person who has known you since your childhood) and without any solid evidence to substantiate your account? According to my psychiatrist it would be technically possible (although they don't normally do this) to tailor the test to a single person, but I'm afraid that might increase chances of a wrong diagnosis.  Any suggestion will be greatly appreciated.   **TL;DR:** I suspect I have ADHD, but I'm not sure whether to undergo medical examination, since there is very little data available on my case. I'm afraid this lack of data could result in not being diagnosed even though I may have ADHD, or vice versa, being diagnosed with ADHD while I may have a different condition.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Need advice about parents, or at least just to vent about this;;;So my mom is kind of in denial about my ADHD. The only reason I was diagnosed at 16 last year is because my teacher pressured her to get me tested. I feel like my grades are slipping more and more each year, no matter how hard I try to focus.  So as soon as I was diagnosed, she told my doctor she didn't want to do drugs, so I saw a therapist regularly. That didn't work, so the doctor suggested we try non-stimulants. My mom really made it clear she preferred non-stimulants. The doc said that these may not work, especially because of my size (I'm heavy because of my height, not fat), so if we had trouble with side effects or it didn't work, we could try stimulants. My mom agreed to this.  One month later my sleep schedule has slightly improved, but during the day I feel no difference in concentration. It's actually worse because of the nausea. Now I'm doing terrible in Cross Country because I almost throw up every time I push myself, and all my teammates are making fun of me, assuming I'm just lazy.  We have a follow up with the doctor soon. They said to get tests done at our family doctor (which they require before prescribing stimulants) before the follow up so it was out of the way in case we decide to switch. I've told my mom about all these problems, but when I asked her when we where doing the tests, she said "now why would we need to do that?" in a passive aggressive tone.  I'm pissed off now. I know there are risks to medication, and they aren't a magic fix to anything, but at this point it seems like the only thing that'll help make me a normal student.

My semesters usually start off great, I'm focused and I make sure to stay on top of everything, but within a few weeks I start slacking off, missing assignments, cutting down on practice time, stop working out, etc., an d then in the end of the semester I realize how much I've screwed myself and I work extremely hard to catch up. I need someone to help me stay on track so that I don't have the mid-semester slack and the end rush, and I figure that someone that understands would be best. We would stay in contact and make sure that the other is still being a good, productive person.  I'd prefer a student buddy, but anyone would be great! Just send me a message and we can exchange information. Even better, if you're in the Bloomington/Normal area in Illinois we could meet irl to really make sure that the guilt stays.  EDIT: Thanks guys! We can all be besties.
ed96a1efda889c1b4889acad53b31114b908e4a091313dad98cf3e9db5e1faae;;;I did it. I can't believe I actually did it.;;;I suppose I'll provide some background on what happened first.  It's been such a long ride that I can't believe it's actually happened.       I'm a computer science major, and the thing is, when you initially start out, you have to get through what's called the entry level courses before you can actually be promoted into the major.        I've been stuck in entry level CS for the past two years.  I've been stuck in the data structures class for the longest time.  In fact, I took it 3 times.  The first time?  I had a huge mental breakdown when I took this class, and my performance tanked as a result of it.  I made a C-, but you need a 2.5 major GPA and a C or better to advance.  I didn't get that.        It was the following summer that I had taken my friend's advice on getting checked for ADHD, as he and some other friends of mine had seen symptoms of it in me.        With my medication in hand, I could see a change coming and told myself that this semester would be the one where everything would turn around.  For whatever reason, they let me go into the next level class, computer architecture, and it was *difficult*.  By that I mean, "I wanted to cry because it was so hard" difficult.  My semester quickly turned to shit, ending up with me dropping this class and my calculus class.  I fell under full time and it was horrible.  Even with medication, I still wasn't doing well.  I was losing hope fast.      Seeing the rigor that was computer architecture and my then weak knowledge of data structures, I decided to backtrack in my degree plan and retake it with one of the best instructors here.  While I managed to learn a lot this second go round (this considering I barely remembered anything the first time with a different instructor), I unfortunately made a D.  Bearing in mind that you can only take a given entry level class twice here... I was going into panic mode.  CS is my life and for it to slip out of my fingers like that?  I wasn't going to let it go that easily.      So, the same instructor taught the same class this summer and I figured it'd be a wise decision to take it then, since I was already familiar with his style and what to expect from.  Along with the one month history class I put myself through... I was actually nervous about failing again.  The funny thing is that... you kinda get tired of failure after failure after failure.  I was so sick of settling for less all the time... and my motivation to do as well as I could went through the roof.  And I guess you could say that's when it "clicked."  I saw the true purpose of my medicine and... results began showing.        I definitely worked harder than any other time in my life, and... I *finally* made the B that I needed to get out of entry level.  I still can't believe I'm out of entry level... it's so surreal.  But I actually, legitimately did it.        I just wanted to shout this somewhere, because if I hadn't been diagnosed with ADHD... if I didn't have the medication as a tool to help me make it through... I don't know what the outcome of all of this would've been.  Reading you guys' stories proved to be encouraging throughout of all of this.  And I have to thank you all for that.  I have my motivation back.  My desire to do well is in full force... a desire I haven't felt in *years*.      I'm not completely out of the woods yet, since I have to retake computer architecture -- and it's my last attempt.  But I know I can make it through just fine.  I got this. :]      **TL;DR: Was stuck in CS entry level for 2 years, *finally* made it out thanks to meds and using them to build better work habits.**

Basically, is there a "you should pretty much start with this medication and tweak from there"? I was prescribed Vyvanse from the get-go (I'm 21, newly diagnosed) and know several people who were also prescribed Vyvanse right away.  I then ran into a few other people that claim you should never start with a long-acting drug and that "everyone" starts with Adderall IR and adjusts from there.  What do you guys think?
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Can't help but have a nagging feeling that ADHD is just an excuse for my incompetence or laziness...;;;I don't know... I mean.. I never thought about it this way until a close friend of mine (who was diagnosed with ADHD at a much younger age than I was, yet still somehow doesn't completely believe in the disorder) suggested that it's just a label and an excuse for weakness...   He's dealt with his ADHD "better than me" (he never had meds, I was medicated for two years but I've stopped for certain reasons) and claims I haven't learned to cope with it as well as he does. His ADHD is not as.. prevalent? I guess? But ADHD affects everyone differently.   Just thinking about this, the fact it's possibly all a label and only an excuse almost wants to make me tear my hair out from frustration and anger... Is ADHD just an excuse? How can I say I have ADHD without using it as a crutch? Which I don't. I don't blame things on my ADHD, but the way I say "my ADHD" almost sounds like it's a reason for blame... This paradox is what frustrates me so much..   I'm just in a lot of emotional turmoil thinking about this... Please forgive me. I don't know what to make of this apparent paradox..  ***Edit: I know ADHD is a very real and debilitating disorder, it's just that the paradox bothers me  *Edit again: Thank you so much for your responses.. I love your community.

I'm a 22 year old girl with ADHD (a combination of type 1 and type 6, if that means anything to you guys), an auditory processing disorder, and a long history of depression and anxiety disorders. I wasn't diagnosed with ADHD until i was 19; at that point they tried me on non-stimulant medication (no response except awful side effects), and then Aderall. I was on Adderall XR for a year and a half, and while I loved how it felt to be on it, it was just too intense for me...it made me antisocial and irritable while on it, and once it started wearing off,  the crashes were terrible. I had horrible dry mouth/swollen tongue, and it actually caused skin sores as well. no matter what I did, I couldn't get the IR version to last longer than 2 hours and the XR version to last longer than 4.  I've been on vyvanse for this last year or so, and it's been good- still effective and helpful without the problems adderall gave me. it has a few side effects (mostly dry mouth and cheek biting) on occassion, but nothing too unbearable.  the only real issue has been that, like adderall, i can't get it to last nearly as long as it should....it really only works for about 4 hours or so. I also take lexapro (10mg) for my depression/anxiety, and wellbutrin (300 mg) for the depression/anxiety/ADHD.  in order to get a longer effect from my vyvanse, my doctor reccomended me taking my vyvanse in the morning like usual, and then taking an immediate release stimulant-based medication in the afternoon to give it that extra boost. personally, i was really hoping she'd let me take two doses of vyvanse (one my regular 60 mg dose, and then one in the afternoon of maybe 25 mg or so), since i've tried that off-the-charts and it works great, but she wouldn't allow that.  she originally wanted me to try taking an IR adderall in the afternoon, but i said i was leary of ever taking aderall again, so she perscribed Dexadrine (5 mg) instead. I'm supposed to take that in the afternoon once my vyvanse wears off.  anyone here have any experiences with Dexadrine they want to share? I'm especially eager to hear from anyone who's tried the Dexadrine/Vyvanse combination (if anyone's tried the dexadrine/vyvanse/wellbutrin/SSRI combination, that would be awesome, but i know that's a long shot haha).   a couple questions in particular- how effective was dexadrine for you? did it cause crashes when wearing off? how about it's affect on depression/anxiety? what side effects have you had? anyone had issues long-term?   If you've tried vyvanse/aderall as well, my biggest question is: how does dexadrine compare to adderall, and how does dexadrine compare to vyvanse?   I just want to find out as much as I can about Dexadrine before I take it...I'm so cautious what i put into my body in regards to stimulants after my past experiences. I just don't want to cause any more harm to my mental health or my physical health- i've had enough of that with Aderall, haha.  any insight, stories, thoughts, etc would be soooo appreciated! thanks you guys!

I want tips to get over it not avoid it with my adderall and a shit ton of caffeine. All my friends can get over it fast and there has to be a way that people with adhd can break that mental wall too.   Edit: I do take my meds.

I will be talking to a doctor about medication next Tuesday.  My question for you guys is if you guys have trouble in larger groups of people.  I feel like my brain wants to be social and converse with everyone but I'm always finding myself thinking about things to say to an point where I don't really say much and feel really awkward.  However, in smaller groups I feel that I can talk a lot more freely.  In a nutshell, I just want to know if medication could relieve some of my inner tension.   TL;DR - For those who zone out in large groups of friends/people, do meds help with your social skills?  Thanks guys! Looking forward to visiting this subreddit more often!

I run personal development website on Russian and English languages.  Among articles on my site there is a post "Coping With ADHD Without Drugs (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) – 14 Methods"  This post is based on my own experience of coping with ADHD. Some time ago i wasn't able to focus attention, i was impulsive and impatient.  Because of ADHD i was not able to study and work well, i had problems in relationship, i smoked cigarettes and drunk a lot of beer. It helped to channel the excessive energy on some activity.  Now it's in the past. I don't drink or smoke, i can concentrate on working activity, i am calm and patient.   I want to share principles which helped me to cope with ADHD with people. I hope this article will be useful for someone.  Please feel free to comment in this topic or on the pages of my blog, i will answer your questions.  Thank you for your restless attention (ha-ha)  Here is the link  http://nperov.com/health/coping-with-adhd-without-drugs/

Any experience with this?;;;Hi, just wondering if anyone has heard of this or has been through something similar.  Yesterday, my GP put me on Prozac as a way to help with my concentration issues. I have been diagnosed with ADHD but she feels that I may have anxiety issues that are causing/contributing to my problems.   Has anyone tried Prozac for adult ADHD? I'd also like to hear about experiences getting off the drug.

I know it's not the best since I probably won't be guaranteed a lot of hours, but it's one step closer to getting my foot in the door somewhere and may possibly lead to a better job in the future!!  I was diagnosed with ADD about 2 months ago even though I struggled with it my entire life. I *finally* started meds right after graduating from college, though I wish I would have had the meds like 10 years ago...my life would probably be way different now. I graduated from college with a degree in Communications and Creative Writing - so finding a job has been nearly impossible. I had an interview about a month and half ago and they passed on me because I apparently made myself sound too ambitious for a regular job (it was at the UPS Store, they legit told me because I had a degree, they couldn't see me there in a year). I've been throwing out applications literally everywhere from retail to grocery stores to babysitting to human resources...this is the first time I've gotten a bite from a legitimate business (heath care providers).   This is only the second interview I've had since graduating in May. I'm super nervous/excited/scared/happy and reeeeally hoping that I can prove I am good enough for the job. Apparently there are 16 applicants and only 4 open positions....  I'll gladly take advice from anyone who has been in a PRN position (or registration/reception positions!) and general advice from people with ADD and how to ace an interview!  Wish me luck!!!!!!

So, I figured I'd give my **unprofessional, patient-level** experience.   I was diagnosed at 11 and my parents refused medication (which I'm grateful for). I had the typical "He has so much potential, but he doesn't apply himself," conversation with teachers and my parents all through school. As an adult, it's easier to understand how my brain works and I decided meds were a good idea.   I've been a caffeine addict since working at Starbucks in highschool and college. I've experimented with adderall, ritalin, ephedrine and mass amounts of caffeine, but the bad always seemed to outweigh the good. I've been on modafinil (Provigil) for just over a year. I started with a dose of 100mg/day, ramped up to 200mg, switched to armodafinil (Nuvigil), back to Provigil and then tapered down to 100mg which is where I am today.  What's really interesting about Provigil is that you don't notice it. You don't get that energy burst like you do with the stims. It builds up slowly in your system, so you don't even see the full effects until about 2 weeks after beginning and when you stop, it takes a week or 2 for you to realize that there was a huge difference with the meds and without. I was on 100mg for about a month, bumped to 150mg for 2 weeks and then 200mg for another two weeks, but I couldn't sleep. I wasn't hyper and didn't have raised BP, but I was nowhere near tired.   We switched to Nuvigil and I could tell something was different. It still worked, but the dosage was different and it gave me this weird head feel. We went back to Provigil and lowered back to 150mg for 2 weeks, then 100mg from then on.  I've gone off for days at a time, forgetting to bring my meds with me on trips and I once went off for about 2 weeks for no particular reason... I just forgot to take them a few days in a row and I found myself asking why I was so sluggish all day and why I couldn't concentrate (typical...). The best thing about it is that it doesn't change you. You're still you, invigorated with ambition and the ability to concentrate on whatever's in front of you.  I've found that if I take 200mg EARLY in the morning, I'll have the drive to work from 6am straight through to 9pm and at the end of the day, I'll have more work done than I'd normally have done in a week. I'm a big fan and honestly, I wouldn't want to go back to how I was without it. I realize that this is a massive wall of babble, but I'm happy to answer questions for anyone who's thinking about modafinil as a solution.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;My experience with ADHD as an adult;;;I'm 51. I've had ADHD all my life and I've never taken any medication for it. I self- medicate using caffeine for focus, and know what my dopamine triggers are (playing music, exercise). I don't eat sugar, don't drink alcohol, exercise every day and am generally healthy. I'm self-employed as a music teacher. My wife and I own a nice house in the burbs which will be paid off in 5 years. I have no debt.  I'm beginning to think maybe I have a very mild case of ADHD. I don't feel the need for medication. I'm a little scatterbrained at times and change my mind a lot, but I'm very organized. I have good systems for everything. I lose things, but only when I don't put them in their place, or when someone else moves them. I like to cook, to garden, to practice my violin - these are all things that people with ADHD have reported they cannot do.  Sure I've had a lot of jobs over the years, but I've also held onto jobs that I like - such as being a cheesemonger (8 years), music teacher (28 years), sales manager (13 years).  I've enjoyed the conversations I have had with members here. I've learned a lot about ADHD and feel more clear about my diagnosis and am working on strategies to prioritize and focus on what needs to be done for my health, the health and safety of my family, and I don't feel so out of control as I did only a short while ago.  So thank you to everyone who has helped me get this far! (you know who you are)
a0eed33ad0fc67f6f368c184df25cb193da90461ea764cd482c36626deda86e0;;;ADHD mods, I have an idea/suggestion that I think might help us out a little bit.;;;I was floating around reddit the other day and I came across an [admin post](http://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/1jr429/moderators_you_can_now_sticky_a_selfpost_to_the/) from about 3 weeks ago which allows posts to be stickied at the top of subreds by mods.  We do have a list of subreddit rules on the sidebar, but still with these we get a lot of posts by people who have either self-diagnosed or include a list of symptoms as if the community is able to confirm or deny their suspected condition.  Though the mods do an excellent job of deleting posts which don't belong I think a part of the problem is that people presenting with attentive issues (whether ADHD or not) are also going to be less likely to pay attention to the sidebar information as the sidebar info in many other subreds is fairly universal and in a way interpreted as visual background noise.  A lot of people probably come here feeling a little desperate and anxious which would also decrease their chances of giving the sidebar proper attention.  However, a top-stickied post entitled "Read before you post" on the subreddit is a little more in-your-face and difficult to skip or ignore.  It would pretty much be a duplicate set of information as is presented in the sidebar.  It could inform of the rules, links to research done on the topic, explanations, definitions of the ADHD types, and answer a lot of questions for people before they ask.  We could even have two stickied posts -- one for the posting rules of the subreddit and one that shares the general ADHD info.  Anyway, it's just a thought.  What do you think, mods?  **TL;DR**: Hello Mods!  Do you think we could add some of the sidebar info to stickied posts on the subred to make it more noticeable and visually accessible to newcomers?

I've read that people with ADD are more creative, and lots of artists, musicians, etc. are diagnosed with ADD. People with ADD are also more spontaneous and willing to try things and take risks. They can think of different and new ways to do things and they can see details that other people might miss.  Can you mention some of your positive sides of having ADD? Come with examples!

Took my meds past few days, taking them tomorrow (long, busy day) but planning on stopping Thursday until school starts Sept 4 for a break  **INFO:**  **Me:** 33 year old male, mature student, single dad  * I am legitimately diagnosed as ADD by a psychiatrist * Started Vyvanse late May, first 20mg, then 40, then 60. It has been 60mg per day since the beginning of July. * I don't abuse it but have tried 60mg + a 20mg per physicians instructions; he had said everyone is different and sometimes you have to play with it to get the right dosage * I am in school but I'm not prescribed Vyvanse for only school, its getting out of the house, getting my daughter dressed, going to the store, life in general, I'm sure we can relate  **WHAT HAPPENED:** I was in summer classes and finished my finals Wednesday(Aug14). Thursday I got up and went out of town and forgot my meds. (Yes kind of dumb but I also wanted a break - Vyvanse is a stimulant and cleaning out my system once in a while is good).   * Anyway Thursday(15th) wasn't so bad but Friday I was absolutely useless! AND I binge-ate silly things, like cereal, totally out of character for me. * Saturday morning I got back home and took my pill so everything was back to normal * I googled withdrawals because being without Vyvanse made me feel even worse than before I started mentally and physically. I was told it wasn't physically addictive, but now I'm worried.  I'm seeing a physician tomorrow but just to refill. But in the meantime does anyone have any thoughts or experiences with Vyvanse and withdrawing? Do you ever go without for a period of time? if so what happens?  **TL;DR:** I think I experienced Vyvanse withdrawals the first 2 days I went without in 2.5 months and it makes me nervous. I'm planning on taking the next week off of it. I'm asking for experiences or thoughts from people who can relate and how you resolved it, or doctors' opinions if you are one  **Thank you!**

Until that is, my teachers found oit. After that, whenever I did something they asked me if I had taken my pills for that day. So I told my psychoatrist that I didn't feel like I needed the drugs (and I hate using adhd as an excuse anyway) I then began to fail highschool eventually passing with D's.   Now that I'm in university I am crashing hard. so the university told me that if I don't get back on the meds I'm being dropped but my therapist tells me that hI "Grew out of it". He has also prescribed me medication for "my depression". He also said that adhd has no effect on memory when I said I was having minor memory issues (names, places, certain words) when I have heard that it can be effected.   So this is partially a rant, but mostly a search for thoughts srcond opinions similar experiences, and do people really usually grow out of it? I just don't know what to do now...  **EDIT:**I feel like I should add that I excell at physical classes such as manufactiong and fabrication (It's an engineering class) but am tanking the paper classes like calculois.

dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;I am a girl who is diagnosed with ADD and at the moment I feel hopeless, alone and scared of thinking about my future;;;I am a 19-year old girl who is diagnosed with ADD.... it is my curse and I dont know what to do or say any longer. I feel empty. Lose words every day. I feel like I become more and more stupid for every day and it is killing me. Sometimes it is hard for me to complete a sentence, and I escpecially can't tell long stories without falling over the words. I have so much in my head that I would like to say but I just can't explain it properly. I am SO bad to hold a conversation with people (strangers fx) because they mostly bore the shit out of me. I want to stay focus but I just keep thinking about something else. Like I would rather lay in my bed and watch a movie or play computer. I feel something is wrong with me because I really want to be social with other people!  If I read something I forget it a few minutes after. Even if it is a simple text or something that really interests me. I want to learn so many things, and I think that subjects in school such as philosophy is so interesting. I understand it but I find it hard to explain the concepts because it is too complex for me. I can only remember simple things as simple facts (trivia???), names (musicians, movies, books), faces, numbers, etc. (within those areas I have, hoewever, a almost photographic memory) Example: I NEVER forgets a face and I can always link names to their faces. I can remember the title of almost every movie/song/musician/book I see/read/hear. I remember numbers (phone numbers, card numbers, etc.) I also know a lot of usefull facts. When I was little I was the best at languages and spelling in my class. School was really fun and easy for me. I wanted to be a writer and I wrote countless of short stories which was really well written by someone at my age. I was also very creative and drew many comics. My teachers and parents was so sure of I would become something big but I really doubt it now. I am proobably only qualified to work in a factory for the rest of my life (no offense, but that is just a little bit sad because I've had so many dreams when I was a kid and it might have had come true if it wasn't for my fucking ADD - pardon my language but it really annoys me and makes me so depressed. Every single day.  All this results in excessive thoughts. That is why I can't sleep at night. It is always bad thoughts about myself. Why am I so stupid? Why can't I say what I really mean? Why can't I take care of myself? No guys wants me because im uninteresting. No one knows what is going on in my head and I can't explain them why I act as I do or why I lock myself in for days because I sometimes gets so depressed without knowing why. I think of suicide almost everyday and it only gets worse. The only thing that is holding me back is that it would hurt my family and friends. I have a good ammount of friends but NO ONE close to me. It is very superficial, and that is fine for me. I usually get up hurting people that is close to me. I am not very close to anyone in my family and I've never been, even though my mom really tries. I feel bad for her because I really dont have anything to talk with her or my father about and I do not really care about them. It really gives me bad conscience but thats just how I am. I think I have one friend I might consider as a little bit close to me, but that is only because she is diagnosed with ADD too and can relate to a lot of these things I also deal with (forgetting things, appointments, getting sad without knowing why, etc. etc.) But we are not that close that we can talk about feelings. Tried, but I always end up talking about something else. Had a boyfriend once, tried to explain him that I was diagnosed with ADD. He just laughed at me and said that it was only a bad excuse for being lazy. We were never that close to each other and thats why it didn't worked out. Though it was a very hard break-up for me, because I wanted him so badly to love me and he didn't. Not because it was him, but because I just wanted someone to love me. I've been so obsessed with trying to make him love me that I forgot to love myself. I want someone I can share all these feelings with and someone who would take it seriously.   I dont know what I should do with me future. I have no interests, no plans, nothing. Just finished school and right now I am stuck in my town with nothing to do. What should I do? Travel? Move out? I am scared that I wont be able to take care of myself. Sometimes I do not have the motivation to get out of bed, and do everyday things as eat, clean my room (it looks like Second World War in there), remember appointments, you know it. I am always tired (except for the nights) and I could lay down in my bed all day and just sleep. If I dont do something drastically right now I dont know what will happen to me.   I dont know what I should ask you guys about to do, just wanted to share this with someone who is in the same boat as me. Maybe some of you can relate to this? Do you sometimes get the feeling of hopelessness? What do you do then?  Sorry if this gets a bit long and messy, my English is not so well!  Btw I am not on any medication. None of the medication my doctor gave me seemed to have an effect on me, I didn't got more focused.

We are on vacation with our ADHD child.;;;Things are not as bad as one of my friends who has children with ADHD and Asperger's. We have been in Greece for a month and have a week to go and the one minus is that she's lost interest in reading. If that's the worst of it for now, I can deal. I've managed to get her jealousy in check regarding her younger sisters, AND we have been able to focus on things like learning to swim without arm bands.

However, while I could focus on things I was doing alone (ie, homework, tests, etc), I still had a very hard time listening to my teachers in class.. Instead I just wrote a mile a minute of what they wrote on the board (if they didn't write anything, I didn't learn anything). I got by my freshman year with the teachers that gave a sh!t ton of notes and reading out of the book. I could spend hours on end reading/copying the book and almost kinda liked it.   That summer I wanted to take a little break on the adderall and did. Sophomore year rolled around and I started back up, but this time on 20mg XR + 5mg afternoons as needed. It worked great for the first semester (as it did in the past) but then second semester rolled around (spring, this year) and i'm at where i'm at now - In a constant daze. I used to take tests and look at a paper for x amount of time and not look up until I was done with the test. Now it's almost like I get some sort of headache during them and I just want to leave. I've also noticed that the hyperactivity is coming back and I almost have a hard time sitting in class for 1:15. I feel like I haven't been "awake" in the last year....  Any of you have this same experience? What did you do? While going back up to 30mg could help, I don't really want to. I make friends easier now and i'm not sure if it's being due to the fact i'm now in my major or if it is due to the fact i decreased my adderall dose.   My closest description to my feeling is that I have some unknown (to me) chemical in my brain that is "pure focus/concentration" and i've used it all. I've also been incredibly scatterbrained but I think that's pretty normal. It also feels like my adderall xr wears off in 6 hours and I come down much harder than I used to... I used to not feel it at all.   Anyway suggestions? Thanks for the scattered read
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Am I building a tolerance to Adderall, also will switching up doses influence its effects?;;;I'm fairly new to meds so I'm not exactly sure how long it's supposed to take to find a working solution, but right now, I've worked my way up to 25 mg of adderall per day and it still isn't doing much. I was diagnosed with ADD back in March and since then, I've tried Strattera, which barely did anything, Ritalin which seriously affected my appetite, which made me lose 10 lbs in a month, and now Adderall, which doesn't have any side effects.  I switched to Adderall XR at the beginning summer to help with focus on my internship work and I started with 5 mg per day and worked up to 20 with minimal results. The doctor at my school prescribed me 25 mg per day. It worked great the first day or two, but after that, the effects haven't been very noticable. However, the thing is, I still have over a dozen 20 mg pills left, so I've been taking those on the weekends when I don't have as much work to focus on, and I'm starting to wonder if the change in dosage is affecting how the adderall is working. Also, I can't get a new dosage until I run through my current supply.  I'm a full time college student, and in addition to my normal schoolwork, I'm working 30 hours a week for my internship, so needless to say, focus is a critical factor in my success right now. I've been able to complete my work so far, but it takes me a long time to focus enough to actually complete it. For instance, it can take me 4 or 5 hours to achieve 2 hours of focus.  I looked it up and it says the average dosage is 20mg per day, so I was worried that I'm building a tolerance too fast. Also, in case it's relevant, I'm a 19 year old male and I weigh about 120 lbs. I'm also on 10mg of Buspar twice a day for anxiety.  **TL;DR: I'm on 25mg of Adderall XR per day, and I've been taking my left over 20mg pills on the weekends instead of the 25mg ones, does this affect how Adderall works?**

(Not sure if this is the right place);;;So I don't know if this is the proper place to post this because I have no idea where to post this. I'm 18 and a high school senior, diagnosed with ADHD-PI about 6 years ago. This has been bugging me a lot recently, especially when looking at and applying to colleges. I have no idea what I want or what I like. Everyone around me seems to have interests and hobbies they can go on about and have an idea about where they want to go and what they want to do with their life, but I have no god damn idea.  I kind of just go with the flow through life. I'm mildly content, but I think this problem is going to make it difficult when it comes to making decisions in the near future.

I planned the next 2 years around taking classes for my major, except that I don't like programming on my free time. Now I always tell myself that I'm not going to be programmer and instead wanted to major in CS just so doors would open up for me in the tech industry in a non-coding positions.  Unfortunately the types of career I want (ux designer) is about experience instead of what degree I have, so that makes it even worse when I consider what I really want to do.  Due to already spending close to 1/2 of my financial aid for the semester, I don't want to drop out since I'll have to pay that back and I also have a sizeable school debt from when I went to state school last year which will start accrueing interest if I drop out.  I feel caged in going to college and it would ironically cost me more to leave than to keep going. I don't know what to do since my decision making is linked to my ADHD...  then again I'm not sure if I'm thinking this crazy because I'm also not on any medication (will change in the next couple of days). I exercise almost daily. The anxiety and not being able to speak with anybody about it is killing me......I tried talking to my long-time friend in the programming class we have but I feel his advice was based on his self-interest of not having anybody to talk to in the class if I did leave....help...
8d53b596f49372c4c201da0d7ab768fc73db40677b86e61614c8b73f2a4ddfbb;;;A Story of the Past Two Weeks: Or, a Ritalin High, five cups of Coffee and 3 Hours of Sleep.;;;  So I was diagnosed with ADHD-Pi a long time ago, but I had always been opposed to what I thought was a pertinant issue of an Overdiagnosis of Stimulants (I know I was probably only half politically correct). I also have some overlying social anxiety, which has made for a good bit of my character.    Two weeks ago I talked to my doctor, who perscribed me a low (18m g) dosage of Ritalin IRs for the long-term. During that week, I did about on par with my normal academic performance. When I ran a race on it 2 days in, I PR'd and noted that the race sent me into a state of total focus. This was probably the only effect I truely believe was definitely derived from the drug. For the 1st 3 days, I was well organized.    So I told the Doctor this, and stated that the organization was oddly placebic of an affect, and he told me to up my dosage to a moderate(?) 36 mg / Day of Ritalin.    Well, that was three days ago. I had 3 hours of sleep last night, and did Homework and organized like nobody's buisness. My taking of the medication overlapped from Sunday to Mon., as I took it at 4pm on Sunday and 7AM(*reg. time) Monday, and so today I was fucked up on that stuff.    I stayed up until 4 last night to do HW, and woke at 6 and have not ceased to be in an oddly crazy state of constant work.    I found it too hard to concentrate because I had 4 tasks going fluidly at once, and was in my own productive world whenever my teachers asked questions that threw me off.    So, as a newcomer I must ask - is this all foreign and odd to most of y'all too, or should stuff like this be expected with medecation and treatment? Will it usually be like this?    (Additionally, may coffee be mixed with most meds without harm?)    EDIT - Thank you all for the great feedback! I went to see my doctor today, and I'll keep all this well remembered! Thanks!
bcc3c74a3dadfeefd484de0a6564b3d93fa267b3bcef661b6bc10d6d4c724ee4;;;I have ADHD pretty but I really don't like amphetamines;;;As a child an as an adult, I've been diagnosed multiple times with ADHD. When I was a child (about 10 - I can't remember much), I was prescribed Ritalin. I could not sleep for the life of me. I would go to bed late and have a hard time waking up. My mom took me off of it and told the doctor to not bother prescribing me anything else.    When I was an adult (albiet, young; 18-19), I went to get an assessment done  due to my teenage angst suicidal idealizations. Again, I was diagnosed with ADHD but they could not perscribe me anything because I tested positive for marijuana and they said that I might have a drug problem (which I just fucking smoked weed), and they didn't want to give me Adderall or any amphetamine because I might get addicted.   Fast forward to a few years later, I had to do a big project (webdev) and my other coding friends take Adderall and Vivance(etc) to keep them wired. They're okay I guess, but they just keep me on edge. I do notice myself being more rational, better concentrated, and even overall a better conversationalist, etc. It does make me a better person. However, it sometimes makes me too focused and it also hinders my libido. I also couldn't sleep that night. I was under the influence of it for about 24 hours.   Any advice on alternative medications or what to do to manage my ADHD?   So I could totally see a chance in me when I take amphetamines, I just don't like all the extra side effects. Also, I don't have access to any therapist/psychiatrist because I don't have any money and the state funded one has my so called "drug problem" documented.   EDIT: I meant to say "pretty bad" instead of "pretty", also, sorry if I slaughtered the spelling of the medications.

Everyone, that's who. So share them!;;;##### WIN WEDNESDAY!!!  #####Science behind Win Wednesday * Scientists think our brain has a built in negativity bias by reacting more to a negative stimulus. In effect, our brain is like velcro for negative experiences and teflon for positive ones.   * Painful experiences are usually more memorable than positive ones and lasting, good relationships typically need at least a 5:1 ratio of positive to negative interactions.  * By **tilting toward the good** you are leveling the playing field.    * **Instead of positive experiences washing through you like water through a sieve, they’ll collect in the implicit memory deep down in your brain.**  * **Soak in the positive events in your life**   * By pausing and holding that positive feeling for a BIT longer, you are slowly changing the wiring of your brain.   * Much of this information comes from *The Buddha’s Brain* by Rick Hanson. Here is a PDF of his [*Positive Emotions and Taking In the Good*](http://www.rickhanson.net/wp-content/files/PositiveEmotions.pdf).  You can find more at *[rickhanson.net](http://www.rickhanson.net)*  *** Win Wednesday is a chance to focus on our accomplishments for the week. Doing this enough WILL change your brain for the better!  ###***The Sacred Creed of Win Wednesday:***  * **Each and every one of us have victories every week, be they great or small. But in Win Wednesday, *no* victory is truly a small one.**  * **Whatever "level" you happen to be at, progress is *always* a cause for celebration!**   * **Please don’t discount anything you have done. The whole point is to share how YOU won, and did not let your ADHD win!** Check out the examples to see what we mean!**  *** * The point of Win Wednesday is equally **to share our wins AND celebrate the wins of others!** If you do or don’t have a win, feel free to give positive support and cheer to those posting (not just upvoting)!  * **Each week Win Wednesday gets hundreds of views, but only 5 people replying to the winning comments...let’s change things this week!** Just saying “good job” means a lot to someone who has been struggling!  *** ##### PHENOMENAL EXAMPLES FROM PAST WEEKS:  * I graduated college!  Fuck yeah! * I paid off my credit card. * FINALLY hung my custom mirror that's been gathering dust in the hallway for about a month. * Finished some more group projects ahead of schedule so I'm not the one everyone is waiting on. * Today I realized I was the common denominator in many bad relationships that are most important to me. I told my loved ones this and started a new chapter today. Feels good. * So far, I've managed to make $90 doing different repair work. This is a pretty big deal for me, my ADHD is bad enough that I'm on disability * I had my highest GPA ever.[1]   with my most difficult courses ever * Got my blood work done, got stuff needed for other medical testing, and I set up an appointment with a woman's counselor to add to the therapy I am already doing * I'm late but I finally stopped talking about auditioning for a play at my local theater and did it!  * I got engaged. :) * I think I have finally identified a definable improvement of my meds. * Many many more!  ##### We love you, /r/adhd!

He is on Vyvanse and has had a huge improvement in school. We still have  challenges at home, which I expect as he is an 8 year old. But we have tried everything for punishment from taking toys/video games away to the traditional time out and everything in between with little success.    Our pediatrician suggested a reward system, I have read very little about this and would like to hear how you do it. What type of behavior do you reward and what do you use as a reward?   Thanks for the ideas!
1abb21b83926269b64ca44206c0c213a0a0f716e75c071b2871a3e100f0873dd;;;Ran out of vyvanse today, anxiety through the roof.;;;This is my first post here, i've browsed a lot and i think the support this group has for each other is unparalleled and I figure I could do with talking so some fellow add/adhd'ers! Anyway, I've been on vyvanse for roughly two years now, I've been diagnosed with adhd since I was 9 and I was on straterra until my senior year in high school. I felt like items my working anymore and I got off it in November of my senior year in high school. Coincidentally, my GPA dropped from a cumulative of 3.35 to ~2.6 for my last semester (partially due to senioritis).   I got to college and I realized I was completely useless without medication. I got prescribed 50mg of vyvanse and of course my first day on it felt miraculous, I felt like I could actually focus for once. That effec obviously subsided after a few months and its now at the point where I don't feel like it works but I know it is, because if I don't take it or even if I take a lower dose I feel a difference.   Today, I ran out of the medication because I forgot to get a new script an my anxiety is through the roof. I feel so useless and depressed like I can't do anything. I'm currently going to counseling for self esteem because I realize how badly adhd affects me; my whole life I was prescribed medication and I never really know what adhd was, I just knew I was hyper sometimes and couldn't focus. (Wasn't until this summer when that i realized that i wasn't living up to the standards that my management job required.). Now I feel like I'm stuck on this medication for life , and at times I don't even know if its helping, because I find myself gravitating to things that are more interesting now more than ever (assuming its because of the dopamine rush coupled with even more dopamine release from doing something fun like video games).   I have some stuf going on at home and my counselor and I are starting to uncover some stuf I never knew about myself and that my play a ole in my sometime feelings of inadequacy and its tough to know how much is from that and how much is the vyvanse. I'm not even sure what I wanted to get out if this, maybe just venting cause I feel like absolute shit haha.  TL;DR Ran out of vyvanse today, terrible withdrawal and contemplating if my medication is actually helping me in the long run or if its exacerbatig my mini addictions that I get when on vyvanse. Just venting?
3b01a0d4ff4b11a6a6cbc4dbc673aa8f6c86e03631df1e122094d26a38d74cc1;;;Wonderful to have ADHD!;;;I just wanted to say, to those of us out there who feel like Adhd is a constant struggle, take it as a blessing! I seriously can not imagine the type of person I would be without my ADHD. It is a complete part of my personality. People who meet me think I'm weird, but I've molded myself to be weird in a good way. I laugh at my ADHD, people think I'm funny. But I also have the ability to be quiet, to entertain myself, to spend hours upon hours programming or talking philosophy, doing math, etc. ADHD has made me unusually smart, due to the amount of time I can spend on a problem I enjoy, the amount of time I spend by myself. The social problems were significant when I was young, but now as an adult I have simply worked passed them, I am now considered a wonderfully social and funny guy, but with a level head. Non ADHD people can't understand us, and that's perfectly OK, because our uniqueness is what will keep them around, help us succeed in life. Enjoy your ADHD, and if your going through a tough part of life now, just remember we can always improve.   *side note: legal adderall, just saying :)

He screened me and diagnosed me with ADD. The thing I'm worried about is the fact that he said we would work on this through meditation and he brought up the fact it could be helped with medication. I do not necessarily want to be put onto medication but I feel like if it was odd. Does this mean he is completely writing off a medication route? Or that he wants to try a more natural way to help my problem before discussing the possibility of a medication?

In our last show, we had a combination of alumni and current students, one of the alumni being a member of The Panic Squad which is a group that does improvisational comedy for a living (think of a mobile Whose Line team).  I just received an email from that guy where he has specifically asked me (and my brother, who has great on-stage chemistry with me) to be a part of the "Panic Squad and Friends" show that's coming up shortly.  I've been geeking/freaking out for the past 45 minutes and just needed to share this with this great community.  Thanks guys!

Any advice or experience with this?;;;I am twenty years old and was recently diagnosed with ADHD. It was something that I had to pursue myself in adulthood because my parents are skeptical of that sort of thing.  My little brother is eight years old and is showing a lot of the same signs that I did at his age -- worse, even. I'm not saying that he definitely has it, but if I have it and his symptoms are worse than mine then I think it is at least worth looking into. It would make sense since ADHD is highly genetic.  I have three other little siblings and he is the only one who is having major problems in school. He literally hates homework (as he is often wont to remind us almost every day) and it is a chore to get him to stay on task with anything.  I've tried employing some of the same strategies that help me, and they do work, but I don't have the time or the energy to help him on a consistent basis. It would be a lot easier if I got help from the school and my parents. I mean, they do help, but not with the problems which I believe are related specifically to ADHD. He gets a lot of scolding and punishments, and while they are not always unjustified I am concerned that it may have long term effects on his self esteem.  If anyone else here has been in a similar situation, I would really appreciate your advice. I don't want to come off as an armchair psychologist. Even if it isn't ADHD, I think my little brother would benefit from some sort of counseling from a child psychologist and I want to be able to communicate that to my parents. They love him and are just as concerned as I am, but they just see him as stubborn. I'm sure many of you can relate!  I just don't want him to go through what I did; the earlier he can get help, the better.  tl;dr - How can I convince my skeptical parents to get my possibly ADHD brother to be evaluated by a psychologist?

I was recently diagnosed with ADHD. At first I didn't really realize how much it affected me but over the last few months it has become more and more apparent and I really feel crippled by it.  I am an artist and I like to work on all different kinds of art. I draw comics, I design worlds, I write songs, and other sorts of things.  I'll get really hyped up about a new idea or drawing or song or whatever and spend hours working on it but unless whatever I'm working on can be finished in one sitting it rarely ends up completed. I have a painfully hard time bringing myself to work on any kind of project more than once.  I love coming up with ideas for epic webcomic masterpieces with overarching themes and enormous worlds and creative creatures and environments. And I have an easy enough time planning it out but once the task is drawing the first page or writing the first line of description then the whole idea seems too daunting to even begin and I always get so discouraged.  I feel so shitty every time I get excited about a new plan or a new idea and then I never follow through with it. And this doesn't just happen with art, it reflects in other parts of my life too. For example I was getting into gymnastics last year. I'm not the most athletic person but I'm limber-ish and I figured it would be a cool, fun way to stay in shape. For the first few classes I was killing it, I was super motivated and I worked really hard and progressed quickly. But after a couple weeks both my motivation and energy level started declining and I found myself more and more tired during classes until one day while I was practicing my backflip (which I had done successfully on my own) I put so little effort into it that I nearly landed on my head. Thankfully my instructor was spotting me and he pushed me to safety. After that experience I didn't feel safe continuing my training.  The pattern tends to be that I'll be very excited and very focused and involved in a new activity or idea and I'll perform really well, but lose interest so quickly and it sucks!  I just want to be able to make a really awesome comic book, or keep working on gymnastics until I can do cool tricks and be fit and everything, or record an album or something, but I always end up stopping before I've even begun.  I've thought about taking medication or getting treated or whatever but I also don't want to become dependent upon a drug. I know it may sound kind of hippie-dippie but I'd rather find a way to overcome this obstacle on my own. I may also just be scared of negative rumors I've heard about ADD/ADHD medication.  What do you guys think?  **TL;DR**: I get excited about stuff but never follow through. Should I take meds?  **edit**: paragraphs!
f4e98bd5d27a25d09efb26d9032156e307aa748c6741a23857179bf70c152e01;;;I(20F) need some advice from ADD/ADHD'ers to best help my partner(21M) who was recently diagnosed;;;Let me just start this out by saying we've been in quite a successful relationship for the past 5,5 years and, as the title says, my partner has been diagnosed with ADHD a few months ago. I love him greatly, but I'm not a trained mental health professional and I need some advice on how I can best help him with some of the difficulties he's been having lately. Everything I have written here I have discussed with him openly. There's nothing in here he doesn't know, so advice to talk to him about this all will be rather useless.    We've been living together for 3 years now and this year I sent him to our GP because I noticed that he's been quite down lately, lower self-esteem than usual and was having great difficulty focusing on college. A few months after he gets his diagnosis and we took it as best as we could. It didn't change much for me, clearly he's always had it, so it didn't cause problems in our relationship, and I was just happy that he could finally start getting therapy that would/will help him out greatly. So far he hasn't missed any appointments, does as much as he can for it and takes his medication when assigned.  Now, he's always had a low self-esteem. It got better through the course of our relationship, but lately it seems to be getting worse. We took the diagnosis well, but he has always had emotional turmoil due to constantly comparing himself to others, including me. Now however, his diagnosis is also incorporated in these thoughts and feelings and to put it bluntly, he feels like an absolute failure who just isn't working hard enough. Now he feels he needs to work harder than NT people just to prove himself and to not let the ADHD be a convenient excuse. It doesn't help that, while he's never had jealousy issues, he feels inferior to my male friend (through college, it's hard for me to befriend, so it's relatively new that I have a good friend who is not mutual), because he is so much better in a lot of ways and he will never compare. The issue with that isn't that he's afraid of me dumping him for the friend(it's been discussed heavily and openly, it really, really isn't the main issue), but that he has to compare and he just can't control these emotions and thoughts. Clearly it puts a strain on my friendship, because I want to be accommodating without it coming at the cost of either of us being miserable or losing on a good friendship, but it's honestly tiring.   I try to reassure him as best as I can and I always tell him he only needs to work as hard as HE can, and to not compare himself to others, because screw others. I remind him that ADHD is just as real as any other disease, it affects him and the only obligation he has is to work to the best of his abilities. However, the reassuring is taking a toll on me because I hate seeing him in so much (unnecessary) pain and I really don't have as much patience to constantly be able to support him to the best of my abilities every time he talks about it or I notice he's down. I want to help, which is why I am here and I always make him feel like he can talk to me about anything and not be judged, but I have been trying to steer him towards talking to his psychologist about it. I am really afraid he won't talk about it with him however and that he has to suffer needlessly, much to the dismay of his well being.   Another point of worry for me is that some of his behaviour seems altered and/or worsened since he's been on Ritalin. As a couple, we're clingy, we like to tell each other all the silly things that happened that day and let each other know anything (groceries, how long until we're home, what we just found online, etc.). Lately I feel that he has become clingy to the point of obsession. He will send me more messages throughout the day, which is fine, but if I haven't responded within 1-2 minutes, he'll ask me if I have connection on my phone. This stresses me out greatly, he knows this, because I'll either be at college attending a lecture or be home on my rare moment when I have the apartment to myself. (This rarely happens because he doesn't have as many classes and I'm a medstudent, so most of the time I'm home later and we will always be together until either of us go to college again).  He knows my problems with it, but it seems to me that he doesn't have much control over it. We had a good talk about a few nights ago, so when it happened again yesterday, when he had to rush because he was late for an appointment at college, I was worried and admittedly pissed(note, I did not act this out on him in any way, only reminding him firmly to send me messages later and just focus on getting to the appointment on time). He admitted it was a relapse, we talked about it and that was it. I am just still so worried about him because in all our years together, his behaviour has never been this worrying. He's never been obsessive, and by god I hate using the word obsessive, but it's simply the best way to describe it.   I am sorry for the length, it's hard to try and explain without going into details. If there are any question, feel free to ask. There are plenty of things going on as well that just can't be fit into here.    My question is, is there any advice that you could give me? Is there anything that really helped you out when you were still trying to make sense of? Are there things he needs to hear and/or realize that just can't come from me?(He'll read the thread too, don't know if he'd comment as well)   TL;DR: Partner just got diagnosed, thought we handled it well, but seems to cause self-esteem issues to become greater to the point of obsession(?). Might be due to medication, we discuss everything, but I need help helping him.  Edit: Formatting

My day flies by so much faster on days where I take the medication and just plods along on days I do not.   I was curious about if any of you have noticed similar things. I know there have been various studies that have looked at the impacts of things like cocaine and marijuana on the perception of time so it is certainly not out of the realm of possibility.   Edit: seems to be a split between some experiencing time moving faster on meds and some experiencing it moving more slowly.  If you experience either of these please share what meds you take if you are comfortable with doing so and we can see if there are any commonalities between those in each group.

Specifically in Canada;;;I've recently been diagnosed as ADHD and so far have paid about $1K of $2K for the service. I was hesitant to sign up, but it's a life changing thing to figure out so I decided I needed to do it.    After going through the process I started to feel I was being taken by scammers:  * they are incentivized to test positive  * the doctor's time is paid for by Canadian health insurance, so this is basically private healthcare (and the operators are sitting on a hen that lays golden eggs)  * I asked if they could reduce the price and they insisted they could not. They  outlined their business model which in my interpretation amounted to "the market supply/demand curve indicated that ~$2K is what someone will pay for diagnosis &amp; treatment so we'll charge that and provide some other services to make the cost seem fair".   * They then told me to use more of the services to get my money's worth. I had already explained that I'm reasonably successful as a person and the only piece missing is medication (and that part is paid for by OHIP).  * I figure I've taken maybe 4hrs of their time so I pay them ~$250/hr and they (other than the doctor) don't do much in this time  * I asked if I could see the doctor directly, but he has closed his clinic   Am I right to feel I'm being taken by scammers? Should I just pay the gatekeepers to get the treatment?  TL;DR:   is &gt;$2k too much for ADHD treatment? (just diagnosis and medication tweaking, not the medication itself).   Can anyone recommend good ADHD clinics in Toronto (specifically for adults)?

I need some guidance.;;;*edit Thank you to all the replies so far, truly appreciated! And I am still listening, I haven't said much but this thread is still active./ ---   The big red warning is a little intimidating (You know... "Please search /r/ADHD and yadayada... /r/ADHD is not your personal research assistant"). I don't mean to track mud on the community carpet, so if I'm fucking up let me know guys!  Alright, here we go.  I am depressed, struggling with college, struggling to be an adult, just struggling in general. Being alive is really difficult for me, and nobody understands my difficulties.   For the longest time I blamed my ADHD symptoms on other things, like my depression or just not having any drive as a person... and my family assumed the same. My mother is my prescribing doctor, but she still says stuff like "Just do the work and you won't be in this situation."  I go to Berklee College of Music in boston. I am one of those high-IQ ADHD persons, my thoughts wander all over the place and I love to learn. I gobble down maybe three documentaries a day. I seem to spend forever in the shower each morning, just kinda spacing out in there and letting my brain mull things over. You know how it is.  Also I've spent waaay too much energy trying to "cure" my depression, or performance anxiety, or insomnia... or just whatever. In the process I've discovered all kinds of techniques, including meditation and Alexander Technique (plus some stuff I've come up with on my own). That's my little ADHD head-universe. I think we all carry one around.  So I mean... i was pretty good with legos as a kid.  But here I am! My life is looking pretty bad, I've been getting worse and worse. How do I fucking do this guys?? I can't seem to engage with the world, can't seem to set goals or manage my time... Meditation and some of those other things have helped me a bit. I can at least keep my classes under control through sheer force of will, but things are hard and getting harder.  Man, you have no idea what kind of pain I've been through. I've been as low as a person my age can get. Took two years to wear me down to this point but I've been having suicidal feelings. The worst kind, feelings that sort of simmer from below until suddenly you realize- this is serious!   I need guidance, I need understanding, emotional support, something. No I'm not gonna kill myself... well I'm resisting as hard as I can. Deep down in my core convictions I fucking hate suicide. And I'm tough too! I've endured so much pain already. But my strength is failing. Until now I never understood what people meant by that. Either you want to die or you don't, right? Well...  I mean, I don't want to fucking die but I'm scared anyway. It's a strange thing. My strength is failing. This time next year there won't be much of me left to preserve. By then I'll be worn down to a fine paste.  ................So how do you guys deal? I need tips. Please, talk to me about this. I need as much support as I can get right now.

Have been diagnosed and dealing with ADHD for most of my child and adult life. I'm 25 now and along with Adderall I self medicate with nicotine. I'm in the middle of my fall semester and even with medication (opposed to last fall with none), my new classes require 10x the focus that my last classes did (Civil war history especially since I have no interest, not to mention I had to take it as a 'filler' class and it doesn't count toward my major).   Not looking particularly for advice. My last appointment they didn't want to raise the dose which is fine but now I'm thinking of trying a new medication out in hopes that it won't make me feel extremely depressed and awful once it wears off.

I'm still experiencing more anxieties than without stimulants and don't really feel like getting up in the morning. I do feel so much better on concerta than ritalin but- what are the good tips on beginner? Any specific exercising? Meal plans? How to learn the sleeping pattern?

I am also posting my story, yes I'm seeking advice, but I'm more using this as a medium to vent my frustration ;). **So don't feel the need to read all of this** I'll do my best to keep your focus.  10mg adderall is finally kicking in but I should be studying for a huge exam tomorrow morning.  Anyway, growing up I was a creative child, I loved tinkering with toys and taking apart anything to figure out how it worked... but school was never easy. I never EVER paid attention in class, there was something in my brain that made me physically hurt to try to focus.. I could never study, but I was a creative kid that liked to have fun and do things I wanted to do.  But I was never diagnosed with anything.. as I was able to slip by with passing grades, however much it hurt to do so.  Fast forward to senior year of high school (6 years ago). BOOM, what do I have? stage 4 cancer! yay! Although I wish I never had cancer, I get a lot of pride knowing what I am capable of, and during those 6 months of chemo, I learned a lot about myself. As a result of the cancer, a lot of PTSD came with it :/.  I was luckily able to graduate high school on time by taking online classes.. which sucked and if it wasn't for my mom writing my papers, I wouldn't have graduated. I've had great support, when I had cancer, my mom did ALL of my college applications for me.  Which brings me to the next part of my life story (I would be surprised if anyone is still reading, I want to work on my story telling skills, but i'm keeping it brief). I was accepted to a big 10 university, a big 4 year party school. I had applied for the college of engineering (WHY) but didn't get in. Thanks to my Mom, she talked to the admissions counselor and I was then admitted to the college of engineering. THIS is all before I started any medication.. So here I am, a cancer-surviving freshman who is in denial about his ADHD enrolled in an advanced engineering program at a nationally ranked school (How the hell did this happen?)   Can anyone guess what happened by freshman year? I failed... HARD.. I failed pre-calc.. PRE-CALC. I did so poorly I had to apply to get back into school. I had thought about taking a year off and finding who I was.. but I had a feeling that I would never go back to school (or engineering for that matter). Something had to change, and one day my mom decided she would take me to a doctor.. she told the doctor about my problems paying attention, I filled out a random form and he reads over it and says "BY GOLLY, you have ADHD!" (not quite) but I am prescribed 30MG of vyvanse, and I'm incredibly eager and optimistic if that is exactly what I need to turn my life around.  And it was! (Kind of) Yes, this is my fifth year of college right now, and I'm set to graduate in May with a degree in computer engineering, and minors in computer science and mathematics (I made pre-calc my bitch), I made honors last semester, and I know the rest will be a breeze.   On one hand, medication saved my life.. I am in a great position to become an incredibly productive member of society.. But I feel I'm doomed to have to take medication for the rest of my life.   On the other hand Vyvanse (FUCKING EVIL DRUG) really gave my some screwed up anxiety, I have a lot less (from low dose adderall) but that year that I took vyvanse was worse than when I had cancer.. the anxiety, depression, loss of sex drive, loss of being able to be social.  I'm worried that I will have to take medication for the rest of my life.. even though I'm currently on a low dose of adderall (10 - 30mg) I still have a good amount of anxiety. I started taking anti-anxiety medication 6 months ago to help with it (lexapro) and it helps, but it also comes with side-effects.  I really need to go start studying.  **TL;DR: I would love to reach a point in my life when I am free from all medication but I feel like that may not happen for a long time. Long term users, how has medication affected your life??** **  **
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Nicotine as treatment?;;;I'm currently in the process of getting diagnosed and hopefully getting treatment. Until then I don't really have many options, I'm a college student struggling to get by. I have found nicotine or chewing tobacco to really help me in focusing. I used to be a dipper throughout highschool and my first year of college. Quitting a year and a half ago because I was tired of being addicted and wanted to keep my gums. However recently I picked up a can and let me tell you, it is a night and day difference after a year and a half of quitting. Made me realize I was self medicating the whole time. Is nicotine a viable option? Which is more dangerous nicotine ( in this case chewing tobacco) or ADHD meds? Are ADHD meds just as addictive?

For for the first time I wasn't overwhelmed with life. My room was organized. I could sit down and finish simple homework tasks straight through. For once I could make it to work on time and finish all my assignments with no problem.   I realized that I was not a failure, that I indeed had a problem that medication could help! But then... My tolerance kept rising and my doc kept getting suspicious I was seeking I guess? I told her I had class after work and needed something to cover from 9 am to 9pm she wrote me a perscription for 4 10mg adderalls split throughout the day but it was simply not enough. When I came in telling her this she yelled at me and told me she can't go any higher so instead she wrote me a rx for strattera. This past week of strattera has been hell, I haven't even touched my hw, all I do now is sleep. As soon as I came back from work I pass out and have no motivation.  My question is.....what do I do? How do I explain to my doc that I truly and not seeking and strattera is not helping. Does anyone have any succes stories with strattera? Will it improve Should I stick with it?  School is getting rough and I can't risk my add getting the way. I've paid 10 thousand out of pocket for this semester alone and I still have no motivation to sit down work and succeed for some reason. Any advise from you guys would be greatly appreciated.

The school only had 7 students, four of them was the teachers kids. From I started first grade till fifth grade I got bullied a lot, the teachers didn't care all, until I got angry and beated the girl who started everything. Then it was just me being aggressive.  From fifth grade to tenth grade I got new teachers, my fostermom had me tested, and I almost got diagnosed with add, but I didn't score enough. So she even told them that It was hard for me to concentrate and I have some anger issues.   Oh well, It didn't help. They called me stupid for not concentrate and when I tried to stand up for myself, they just started yelling at me, when I tried to go outside and calm myself down, they just followed me. I usually got so frustrated and mad, that I lost all control. I started with me shouting back till I got to a point where I threw everything I could find at them, even hitting.  After all that aggression was gone, and I was calm I realized what I did, I just ran home.  The teachers called my mom, told her that I was expelled because I got angry because I didn't want to listen. They also told her that I was dangerous, I had a twisted view on reality and she should have me tested.   I tried to tell her what actually happened, but she didn't believe me. Even my classmates tried to tell her what they saw, and she didn't believe them either.   After a while she had me tested, the only thing I got close to was autism, but I still didn't score.   It was me and a girl with adhd who always got in fight with the teachers, got expelled alot and when everyone in class went to the principle and told him what happened, it was just us who disliked him.  We even called a principle in a school nearby, and explained what happened, and what we could do, he told us that he'll take care of it.  He called our school, and the principle made him think that I was the one making other people hate him.   When me and my friend with adhd got in eight grade we just gave up. Everybody believed that we was dangerous and tried to make the other kids believe in our ''lies''.  We almost stopped going to school, it wasn't worth getting in so much trouble because of the teachers and nobody believed in us anyway.   Oh well.. When I started high school and moved away, It was something complete different! My mom told my teacher that I lied a lot, was lazy at school and was dangerous.   First thing that happened was my new teacher wanted to ask me how I felt. I told her everything that happened, the teachers, all the lies, I'm not dangerous and the only thing is that I have a hard time concentrate and I get angry if I feel like I'm being treated like shit.  I told her that nobody believed me, and the only thing which is a issue is that I can't concentrate and I only get angry if I cant be alone to calm myself down.   She smiled and said that I was not stupid, and the only thing she couldn't believe was that we was seven student which saw the same, and two teachers who didn't want to get in trouble, and still nobody believed in us.   She helped me a lot that year, she was the one who listened to me instead of my mom. It made everything so much easier. She even improved my grades just by teaching me other ways to do it!  She helped me getting a psychiatrist who just listened to me.  I got so good grades, I got new friends and a teacher who sorted out my life. She even called my mom and told her that I was a good student, and I was far from dangerous.   In may I got a lot of flashbacks, my sister got concerned because that happened to her too, because our childhoods. It was a fucked up time with the child services, lawyers, I was stressed all the time and I did bad at school.  My head was a mess, and all I wanted to do was escape from everything. I was drinking the night before a meeting with child services. That ended with a suicide attempt.   I was sent to an mental institution, I told them about everything and how I felt. I got diagnosed with add, ptsd and anexity.  My fostermom was with me on a meeting where I and a psychiatrist explained her about my add, symptomes, my childhood and what I felt she could start doing.   It took us both a few weeks trying to understand but afterwards it all made sense! She even called the teacher and made him tell the truth.  Now she finally understand that I never lied, I was never dangerous and the only way I have been aggressive was when I had a really good reason. It's like get to know a new side of her, without any fights. She respects me for who I am and I can even speak to her and she listen.   When I realized that, I didn't belive in it. I didn't want to believe in it either. But afterwards I just had to accept who I am and had always been.  Six months ago I was drinking away my problems, now I got an apartment with my boyfriend, just started school again and I even got a dog!  I have to say that after years being called stupid and people making me feel bad about having a lack of concentration I actually feel proud of having add, because that's just the way I am!   If I didn't have add, I would not feel proud of getting something done and get positive feedback. I would probably never been able to tell people about how they treat me. Yes, my head is a mess, but that doesn't mean I cant do anything a normal person can do.  And the part which made me think this way is that my mom started using drugs because she felt like it was a way to live. She got addicted, and needed stronger and stronger. All her four kids got taken away from her, when I was born, she got skitzofrenia and eight years later she died because the doctors gave her the wrong medication. All this because she wasn't strong enough dealing with her problems instead of taking drugs.  But I know I have been through a lot, and It makes me feel so much stronger. If I didn't have my add or any other problems and everything was perfect, then what am I supposed to do when something bad happens?  And It seems like a lot of people here is just focusing about the bad part of having add/adhd. I know many of you are strong dealing with something people doesn't understand or even thinks that it doesn't even exist! But honestly, how would you deal with losing that proud feeling when you finish a assignment and get a good grade? Or that good feeling when you sit a whole day crying because you think you cant do it, and two days later you're done? Or even losing all those good memories which came from you doing something risky? And how are you supposed to solve a problem, without your creative mind?   I hope more people will actually start realize it's not just negative having it, and start accepting that you have it!   I'm proud of having add, what about you?

Not all of it was ADD but when you don't know you have it, there's a real lack of motivation and a lot of self worth flushed down the drain.  I was diagnosed right before I graduated, I'm in college now.  There is motivation and medication now, but I feel like I'm cheating myself.   I can hyper focus, something I've had before medication, 2 hours before an exam and ace it.  It's still hard to concentrate, a little bit easier to read, but incredibly difficult to retain information.  Memory retention has always been like this, I forget absolutely everything even when I don't cram.  I have a 4.0 but I don't remember any of the material, I can't have an educated discussion/debate with anything because I simply don't know it even though a number shows I should.   I wish education was more comprehensive, a test on all aspects of what I know and can contribute to rather than based on what you have to know to pass an exam.  Standardized tests and meeting education requirements, they don't mean anything.  This 4.0 doesn't mean anything. It comes with ease. It comes with ADD hyper focusing, something I was able to do before medication.   I rely on what I can, and not what I can't.   This number used to mean the world to me, I wanted to show people I'm capable and smart enough to soar above a 1.8  I can't say I deserve my current GPA, nor can I say I'm proud of it.  Thank you for letting me rant.

And as you all know, the very term has the word "disorder" in it. As much as ADHD has negatively impacted my life. I think a large part of the negative experiences I've had are due to living in a world set up by people without ADHD. Just because we don't fit in all the time, surely this doesn't mean ADHD is a "disorder" ?  Are you offended by this term? Does anyone here see ADHD differently?   I find most psychological / "mental health" problems have a degree of bias in them. "Oh you don't fit in with society so there must be something wrong with you" sort of thing.   I don't see ADHD as a gift necessarily, but I'm not entirely convinced with the whole "disorder" thing either.   What are your thoughts?  **EDIT**: The general verdict seems to be 'no' - thanks for the feedback guys.

Called home today [20, M] - Here are my results.;;;Skip the following if you wish: _____________________________________  **History**  * 20 year old male. In college at present and only child.   * Parents are both attorneys, grew up in high expectations household. (Not that I took that badly or anything, I actually enjoyed my lifestyle and wanted it to continue.)  * Suffered through middle and high school, with ups and downs (but was generally above complete failure due to the super head start I had while growing up in my parents care.)  * I frequently misplace and/or lose items that are necessary for school and work. I've lost cellphones, iPods, my passport, credit cards, wallets, house and car keys, school ID's permission slips (from those younger days). Sheet music for instruments.   * Struggle in mathematics (since 4th grade) and foreign languages (since middle school) despite my desire to pursue both of those interests respectively.  **Diagnosis**  * Transfer student after freshman year of college, (Joined my high school debate team, which helped with college.) The college team fell apart so I left, transferring to another school in state with just barely a 3.0 *the best two academic semesters of my life.  * Started suffering again last year, the new university had a lot more activities and I gained a few close friends. Overextended myself course wise and the bottom fell academically.  ##Results  * I scored above the 90th percentile for ADHD-PI and again in a test of my age group from when they were young. **This was the second opinion, from a clinical psychologist,** recommended by the psychiatrist I sought first [and at the time believed I out to pursue a more accurate diagnosis *(and because the university I attend has a robust medical center)*].     * I elected to take the slower route because I kind of have a fear of medication. My parents were under the belief that it was unnecessary and that I'd become addicted.   * They alluded to the fact that a middle school teacher indicated I might have ADD/ADHD but were afraid to do anything because they didn't want me to be stigmatized.   * I had refused to talk to them about college, classes or grades, and while this did in the end make me feel better, it may have ultimately cut them out of the most important time regarding diagnosis.   ##What I've Learned  * The debate team helped me organize arguments and talking points into bulleted lists (it may seem as though I'm on medication now, but I'm not I also started writing this at 11:30AM and its now 1:20PM CST).  * I stay away from drugs and alcohol because a) mother prosecuted narcotics cases and b) I have a very addictive personality.  * My parents in the end were very supportive. My problem was that I had believed the countless arguments in which I was lazy. I waited for six college semesters before doing anything about it. I personally believed that one day, I'd get up and everything would be easier. I'd stop these silly and sinister distractions and just get my work done.   * Honestly before I transferred while at my first college I thought I had been 'cured' as I led myself to believe.   __________________________________ ***IF YOU SKIPPED START HERE*** *and don't give me BS about it being long. You can read the following portion.* ________________________________   **"TL:DR"** for the last part**:**   * If you fear your parents are or will be unsupportive, you should consider getting tested. Caveat: I'm not saying everybody should be tested for ADHD - I'm saying that if you have the symptoms  * Like many of you I thought my parents would laugh at the recommendations of the medical professionals - they didn't. When I spoke to my father I said exactly the same things I'd been saying before. I think that their findings allowed him (an attorney) to be more open to what I had to say.  * There were academic concerns I had hidden from my parents [starting during college], so they assumed that everything was fine when in fact it was not.   **I hope to keep you all updated about my progress. My parents have surprisingly become supportive. There's still more I have to tell them regarding grades &amp; what not, but we'll cross those bridges when we get to them.**  Have an awesome day /r/adhd. you guys rock!
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;(Long post!) I need input about the pros and cons of treating my son's ADHD... He's supposed to start his pills tomorrow, but I'm scared. I'm just gonna ramble, and any advice or experience is welcome!;;;**TL;DR: Eight year old son was recently diagnosed with ADHD, I’m scared to medicate him, because I don’t want to change who he is. Whadda I do?**  ____________________________________________________  So, my son Travis has always been my little “space cadet” –that’s been his nickname since he was about two years old.   He’s eight now, and after struggling with second grade (and now BOMBING third grade), he’s been diagnosed with ADHD. He’s always been unable to focus: he has a hard time even looking into someone’s eyes when they’re trying to talk to him. In class, his teachers have expressed concerns that he almost NEVER knows what’s going on. He can’t seem to internalize things he doesn’t want to: like math formulas, for instance. He’ll come home with an easy math worksheet, I’ll show him how to solve it, and twenty seconds later, he has no clue where to start. He also gets very frustrated and is quick to get snippy and angry, especially if there is a lot of input around him. He is NOT hyperactive. His doctor pointed out that he was fidgety during his evaluation, but I’m sorry, he’s EIGHT. I would think something was wrong if an eight year old DIDN'T wiggle a little during an hour long appointment. He never gets up and walks around class, never acts crazy—he’s really mellow, just always in daydream land, unless he’s hyperfocusing on his interests (right now he’s home sick on the couch watching his billionth Skylanders SwapForce video).  I grew up with parents who didn’t believe in medicating kids, and I have always preached VEHEMENTLY against medicating my son for any reasons like ADHD (because to be honest, I thought it was mostly bullshit—I figured it was lazy teachers and parents wanting to dope their spirited children into submisison). I obviously didn’t know anything about ADHD, and I’ve come a long way in the last few weeks. I’m eating crow now.   So, he got diagnosed, and the doctor wrote him a prescription for 18mg Concerta, and told us to try it for 4-5 days, and then double it if we thought we needed to. I guess the point of all this rambling is just that I need a little reassurance that medicating him is the right thing to do.   At this point, it feels right, because he CANNOT focus on anything even mildly unpleasant. If it’s Minecraft/Star Wars/Pokemon, he can tell you every single thing about it like an encyclopedia. If it’s math, or reading, or how to tie shoes, or putting on clothes in the morning….. He just CAN’T do it. And I always chalked it up to the fact that he was my only child for several years, and maybe I babied him too much, or maybe he was just lazy.   But everything the doctor says about ADHD is just…. SO like my son.  She said the PET scans of ADHD brains are generally 1-3 years younger looking than their non-ADHD counterparts. She asked if I ever feel like I’m babying him, and I said ALL THE TIME. My husband used to give me a hard time for putting Trav’s shoes on for him, or treating him like a little kid instead of an 8 year old. I do that kind of stuff because it almost seems painful for him to get done, and it took SO much time out of our day for such trivial stuff. It sucks seeing my 5 year old niece come over in the mornings, go off to another room and come out completely dressed, shoes tied and everything, in four minutes, while Travis struggles with putting on socks.  This is also helping me to understand my husband, who apparently has severe, undiagnosed ADHD (we just can’t afford to treat it right now, unfortunately). It’s making me more patient with his forgetfulness and distractibility, and his need to blow money on Monsters before work so he can focus.  I also watched the recommended video of Russell Barkley---- that was a great video, really helped me understand how my son’s brain is working.  Here are my issues with medicating Travis:  --My son is cool. He’s got friends and he’s not socially awkward at this point. My adult friends think he is the shit—he’s respectful, he’s kind of eccentric and quirky, and he’s into cool stuff.   --Our doctor seems very ADHD trigger happy—she has it, her kids have it, her husband has it, and they all take meds every day of the year. I kinda feel like she’s not entirely objective about the situation. I almost feel like she’s the Bacardi lady from that episode of the Simpsons.  --I worry about stunting his growth: he’s taller than his peers, and I selfishly want that for him. I want him to be a tall man someday. His biological father was diagnosed ADHD, put on Ritalin, and was much shorter than his father and brothers…. could have been totally unrelated, but it still freaks me out that I might fuck with his height.  --His doc also said some remark about Einstein possibly having ADHD. And while I thought it was interesting at first, once I went home and thought about it, I was like, “well, what if Einstein had been treated for ADHD? Would he have been the genius he was?” I just worry if I medicate Travis, that I’m taking away who he is… I like who he is. I’m worried that he’ll lose that ability to intensely focus on his interests.  Maybe I’m just on the fence because I want him to know that he does NOT have to fit in the box the way everyone else does. He doesn’t have to listen to the man and pass the standardized tests in school, he doesn’t have to be what anyone wants him to be—he can just be Travis. Buuuuut, I also understand that in order to be a “normal” member of society (which I’m sure he will want to be) that you DO have to fit in the box, you do have to act like everyone else and know the norms and rules and bullshit.   …My biggest worry is what he will think fifteen years from now: if I DON’T treat him, will he have so many regrets (like my husband who has had nothing but problems his whole life, and resents his parents for not getting him help? Or if I do treat him, will I have altered the course of his life in a bad way? Gah! Being a parent sucks. It's too damn hard to make big decisions like this.  There’s so much I don’t know, and I’m learning more every day… I’m sorry for ever pre-judging people with ADHD. I think a lot of it came from having friends who were just stupid and mildly hyper who claimed they had ADHD, or friends who were actually medicated that didn’t seem like they needed it from my inexperienced eyes… Now watching my son, I reaslize that there is DEFINITELY something wrong, and my pre-conceived notions were bullshit.  In conclusion, I’m really sorry for ever making light of something that is a legitimate issue. I now humbly request any advice, input, or experiences you’ve had that can help me figure out what is the best course of action for us.

This subreddit community has helped me so much and I gained my courage to go through the process because of you guys.   I went to Kaiser in LA, spoke to a social worker, got referred to a psychiatrist and was prescribed 150mg Bupropion HLC XL (Wellbutrin) once a day. I kept hearing horror stories of dragged out experiences in CA Kaisers, but I had a really nice experience that spanned two weeks and two visits.   Funny part was I asked my doc if he knew about reddit and he did. Told him about this subreddit :P     I originally didn't want a non-stimulant or anti depressant, but my psychiatrist said it would help with my anxiety and to quit smoking.  I know it takes awhile for the effects of Bupropion to work, and I'm on day 2, but I've noticed a huge clarity, vividness, and crisp feeling on it. The thing is, my ADHD is worse so far. I zone out far more often and I can't pay attention to anything. I also fall asleep easily during the day on it, which I don't think is supposed to happen, and I wake up feeling really dazed.      Will Bupropion's effect change and mature as I use it more? I'm going to ask for Adderall XR next, what difference can I expect compared to Bupropion?

I went off of my meds 3 months ago. Everythingg was great, but my father (and also boss) hated me being on adderall, so I tried to stop. I had everything, the girl of my dreams (seriously, if anyone else has found the ONE person for them they get this), a great job, but i still relapsed to self destructive behaviour. I began using pills again (opiates) and when i was sick did things im terribly ashamed of and used her things as collaterall, the whole nine yards. And I don't know why. i knew it would hurt her.  this all exploded this weekend. She's been gone since Thursday and I cry myself to sleep each night I dont see her, but I'm giving her space. My family wants me to go to a 6 month rehab and I know it wont help. Does anyone else struggle with this? how do you handle it?

Since then I have been on three different medications (five if you include the Ritalin I took as a test for a few days and the Dexedrine I take to help tide me over when my meds run out.) I've heard things like "you'll know when you get the right med" ect. So I'd like to hear from someone in the community what it feels like to have a working drug.  TLDR: How do you know when you are on the correct meds?

Thanks to be advice from this particular forum, I brought my elementary, middle, and high school records with me for evidence.  To anyone seeking an official diagnosis, I urge you to make this your goal. My psychiatrist even said she was about to refer me to a neuropsych specialist for an eval, but my records were so clearly textbook ADHD that she did not feel the need to, along with all of my recounts of past experiences.  She was understanding and informative, but most of all empathetic and really seemed to understand where I was coming from.  I was not a crazy forgetful person. My impulses's, my lack of friends, all of the projects that were started and never finished… Not the real me.    Ritalin was the first thing that worked for me four years ago. However, I stopped taking it once I forgot about it after I ran out.  I never really brought it up again to my doctor.    Until now. When reading all of your wonderful anecdotes and advice made me realize that I need to do something.  If not for myself, then for my family.  This psychiatrist has a wonderful plan. Try Ritalin, if it doesn't work we will try something else :-) there were no hoops to jump through, no extreme questionnaires, nothing to make me second-guess myself that I had made the right decision to try it and finally seek help.   Thank you all, again for everything. Sorry for the wall of text.   TL;DR- thanks and you're all awesome. (Bring school comments for initial diagnosis)
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;so what is the long term solution to tolerance to stimulants for ADD?;;;I'm getting very frustrated and pissed off because when my meds aren't working I forget to eat, dont sleep well, can't focus well, remember much, and am just an all-around unfocused.  I've had my dose upped from 20, to 20mg with adderall [5mg] 1-3 times a day, to 30mg to 40mg twice a day (going to be upped the next time i see my doctor) of vyvanse in the past 3 years. 40mg was effective for the longest time out of the 3 doses (a year) and it just dropped off (my sleep cycle didn't help and when my meds arent effective i forget to eat). Now my doctor called and told me to take 40mg twice a day and im probably the most relaxed and sedated i've ever been in my life and could probably go to sleep now. (this dose is probably too high? im guessing).  I went from being a chain-smoking (it helped me focus =/), 8 cups of coffee a day, anxiety ridden, avoident, severely depressed, and unfocused mess who couldn't get anything done to calm, focused,  sleeping well, and A+s in organic chemistry in the span of 3 years due to the fact it was discovered that I actually have ADD. Even though school is important to me all I care is having a quality life and being able to do what every one else can. I have no interest in speeding or doing 10 things at once or being euphoric and these medicines don't do that to me and I don't exceed my dose ever.  I'm so annoyed about this tolerance business and I don't understand why it is happening and what should be done? My psychiatrist is fine just increasing my dose of vyvanse, but won't this just keep happening? I requested to look at switching medications (we did try a very low dose  ritalin at one point that matched my 20mg vyvanse and it didn't work. He also wanted to try adderall xr at one point, but i suspected the same thing would happen with adderall xr.) and he wants to just up the dose. Oh and I've also taken weekends off meds at some points but it's not like  ADD goes away on weekends or you don't need to focus. Any advice? Anyone else experienced this? I have trouble believing there is no solution this and what even causes this?  and with the last dose 40mg it still is effective enough to treat my anxiety issues (im totally relaxed), but it barely does anything for my focusing issues. I also can feel that its in my body 12 hrs.
db8769573ed116a2ba55e76307348bfa2f9395848922e85c2b627a6b38b070dc;;;How do you deal without support? [Rantish];;;It's been a struggle for me. My family is very traditional, close minded, and my parents are very strict, authoritative types. When I was little, it was very obvious to everyone around me that I had problems. My elementary school suggested my parents get me assessed for ADHD over and over again. My parents said I didn't have any problems and that I just needed more discipline. This continued throughout my academic career. I tried to get assessed for it during college, but the counselors there were kind of standoffish and didn't think I had a problem. I can understand that with the drug seeking behavior from a lot of college students.   I finally got fed up with it as an adult at age 29. I was digging through the house trying to find my childhood report cards to show my psychologist at our intake meeting. My mother, being her usual nosy self, tried to distract and deter me as I was looking through boxes for my report cards. Like an idiot, I told her why I wanted them, and she's been on this incessant tirade about how I'm okay and I have no problems and I'm being a huge drama queen.   Yes, I'm 29. I live with my parents. I've been in two long term abusive relationships because my self-esteem has been horrible. My life is a mess. My room is a mess. My work is a mess. I can't remember to take out the trash, do my laundry, etc. My savings is a joke, and I don't trust myself to be able to move out, live on my own in a lifestyle that I can maintain, and still save money to own property. I drive away all of my friends because I'm annoying, or I get really critical and fed up with something shitty they do, or I become withdrawn and I avoid people. I make new acquaintances easily when I feel social because I look young for my age and I act quirky and weird, which is more acceptable coming from a girl my age. I even call myself a girl, not a woman, lol.   Anyway, my mom saw me come back from the pharmacy and wanted to know what prescriptions I went to go get. My psychologist told me not to tell her if she's going to be a huge cunt about it. I've been pretty good about that for a while, but I mentioned that I needed to take certain medication and I wasn't sure if Obamacare would cover my medical necessities in a more financially responsible way. She flips out and tells me that I am normal and that nothing is wrong with me and to not take medication. I get tired of listening to her and go to my room.  She does that psycho thing she does where she stands outside of my room and starts pounding on the door and screams at me. My dad gets involved and he tells me that there's nothing wrong with me. They are both yelling at me through the door telling me all kinds of verbal diarrhea about how I don't need medication and that I've been doing just fine and I'm fully functional and how I'm stupid and gullible for paying for medication because that's what big pharma wants. Yes, because a $10 co-pay a month is a huge scam.   I have a huge headache and I've been struggling with deciding if I should be taking Wellbutrin. My psychiatrist prescribed it to me and I had some issues with it because we never discussed a depression diagnosis and she keeps on saying that I need to take Wellbutrin (buproprin) for my depression, which will help my ADHD symptoms.   I don't know if I agree with the depression diagnosis. I think the way that I feel about things is generally because of my upbringing and my family. Now that my mom knows for certain that I'm taking medication, she's going to be incessantly hounding/nagging at me. This means knocking on my door and yelling at me randomly. Crying through the crack of the door in the middle of the night. Constant guilt trips. Getting other people to tell me that I'm okay. Going through my mail, prescription bottles, leaving me articles from Dr. Phil about how to be healthy using natural methods, lots of screaming and hitting things when we cross paths.   I've talked to my psychologist and we both agree that my living situation is very toxic for many different reasons. The thing is that I'm not financially in a situation where I feel comfortable moving out and being able to sustain myself without failing miserably. I've just started dealing with the ADHD diagnosis and I'm starting with the little things first and hoping to improve in larger ways as I build routines and confidence in myself.   It's just really hard because I don't have a lot of support coming from anywhere. My family thinks that mental disorders do not exist and are due to people choosing to behave in that way. My co-workers and friends trivialize ADHD and think that it's something that everyone kind of has and it's not a big deal. When I've mentioned that I have it and take medication for it, they kind of laugh and say they don't notice. My boyfriend has been great about listening to me rant and rant and rant and agonize over all of the decisions I've had to make and the woes that I've encountered, but I can't dump all of this emotional negativity on him. He has been wonderful throughout all of this, but I don't want to make our limited time together about all of my issues.   It's all a very heavy load to carry around and my mom has a listening and denial problem. I try very hard to ignore her, but she can't leave me alone and I'm trapped in her house. I wish she would leave me alone. Sitting down with her and talking yields no results because she is incapable to listening to anyone else and has to do things her way.   How do you deal with a lack of support when it seems like the people around you trivialize the chaos in your life?   TL;DR - I'm a mess and everyone thinks I'm fine and making a big deal out of nothing.

[rant-ish];;;Meds or not, I never breeze through A SINGLE FUCKING THING. I spent three hours at my table trying to do a POS little calculus assignment that my classmates could do in less than half an hour (a classmate did it in front of me in the bus and submitted it right in front of me, that motherfucker).  Honestly, I feel like the slowest, most retarded person on the planet.  It has been this way since high school, where the writing and assignments began to increase. Before that, I was taking school so lightly that I didn't even consider studying a thing.  I can barely keep up in class lately. It feels like my classmates are all on jet-skis, blazing away, having fun while learning; while I am trying to push a shitty old car to the finish line.  I don't know what my problem is. I get enough sleep, I do enough exercise, I eat enough food.  Seriously, I want to go cry in a corner right now.  **tl;dr i am damn fucking slow at studying and it makes me want to cry**
dfd777eca4e56b941751f5ec077e0f77241cdcfb5aaea61aa61e7104ea65e706;;;Did medication help you with these symptoms?;;;SORRY FOR THE LONG POST;  As a kid, my older siblings always told my parents and myself that I had ADHD.  I took it as an insult, and my parents are strict non-believers in the fact that it's a real condition, so they never even looked into it and I wasn't interested in agreeing.   I started considering the fact that I have ADHD in high school (im 20).  I always just thought I was lazy scum and had no discipline by procrastinating etc., but then i realized I have a real problem. Here's a basic backstory of my school life etc:  - Done nothing for fun except digging holes and sitting on the computer since age 3.  Yes, age 3.  - Dropped out of kindergarten because of too many absences  - Elementary school - missed scores and scores of schooldays, hundreds of assignments.  I was smart enough to ace the tests, so I was never held back.  - High shcool, dropped out my sophomore year due to absences, GPA dropped to 1.2 at one point.  Went back and graduated on time.  I was too smart.  Passed classes easily because the work was easy, even through I NEVER was able to pay attention to the teacher (I tried, HARD) or anything.  I was always tapping my pencil/foot and playing with things near my desk.  - I forced myself to get a little better in community college, but it was just as easy as high school.  I aced the tests, but often found myself taking 10 hours to write a 5 paragraph paper.  - Got to uni, and when I had to focus it hit me like a ton of bricks.  I could not take notes while the teacher was talking and pay attention to what he was saying while thinking about the cute girl next to me and what her dogs name is and who she is and who in this lecture hall i know and oh wait, what color goes well with magenta?   Missing school was never about school itself.  It was about getting up in the morning and knowing i had to go to school.  It was the worst anxiety/frustration/wow-i-cant-do-that-thats-impossible feeling.  Felt like a ton of bricks on my chest every morning.  I wake up and this feeling overcomes me.  I would wake up, and lay there awake.  I would kick and scream and yell and do ANYTHING to not have to go to school.  I started to notice a correlation between different tasks.  I would feel the same way when it came time to clean my room, do homework, do yardwork, chores, go to family events, or even theme parks.  I have always been somewhat of a bully because of my impulsive/compulsive behavior.  I tend to have strong urges to pick random things up and toss them, usually at people. Yell out, sing along loudly to quiet songs, and generally be very annoying(even to myself)  I will stop and try to compose myself when i catch myself doing something, but it just makes me very restless/uncomfortable. Those are the external, observable symptoms i've experienced. Well, some of them.  I get EXTREMELY impatient/irritable when bored.  Foot tapping, pacing, pencil tapping, eating.  I reeeeealy would like to read books for entertainment, but I just CAN NOT do it.  I will pick up a book and it will take me 20 minutes to read a page because I have to reread sentences sometimes 4 or 5 times.  My eyes tend to jump around on the page from word to word in almost a frantic manner.  I love playing video games because I can blank out my mind and just relax it for a while, got really into WoW, dedicated 20 hrs a day to it.  Could never play FPS; my aim was always good but i couldn't focus enough to get frags.  Basically just wondering if you guys have experienced similar symptoms and if therapy/medication has counteracted them.  Becasue as of now, even as an adult, all of these still impact my daily life greatly.  Some days are better than others, but overall a significant negative impact is made on my daily life.   I have always been moody/depressed as well.  Mood swing-y.

Ex-saying if he has a bad day in school that night that he shouldn't go trick or treating to or a school fall festival on that night. I disagree.;;;So right now, I'm in this texting session with her. Shes saying that she wouldn't let him going to this Fall Festival at school if he messes up tomorrow. And more, if he has a bad day on Halloween she wouldn't let him go trick or treating.   He is not diagnosed yet, but shows every sign and it runs in the family. So, he's not medicated or under an behavioral therapy yet. How do I explain to her that I agree with being disciplined, but to take away something like these things before we even have a proper diagnoses or take other steps is wrong and will just hurt him down the lines?  TL;DR Ex wife thinks taking away Halloween if child has bad day of school is okay, and I'm not sure. What do you say?

Taking my medication behind my back;;;When I was first diagnosed I was scripted generic Ritalin which was absolutely horrific for me,  Hardly used, I've kept the bottles incase I come into a financial stump later down the road and can't afford what I'm taking now.  I found out my S.O. was taking them behind my back to concentrate in math class for the past month.  I'm upset, and I feel like he is belittling my disorder.  I've told them this and he said he would fake ADHD to get medication.  I don't know how to approach this situation nor how to handle it.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;How many of you with ADHD get the "paradoxical response" to stimulants? What does it even mean?;;;I'm just curious because I do (diagnosed with ADHD-inattentive type, which is weird because supposedly hyperactive type are the ones that get this response?) and it makes no sense to me. Vyvanse/adderall etc all make me super relaxed,  focused, kill my social anxiety, improvesmy motor coordination (i have the shittiest motor coordination ever w/o meds) lower my blood pressure/heart rate, and make me sleepy and as my meds become less effective I sleep less well, dont eat as much, as well as become less effective. caffeine does the same and so do cigarettes ( i used to drink 8 cups of coffee a day and smoke about a pack of cigarettes before it was properly identified what's going on). It feels like I'm being sedated  by like xanax or something and when the dose is too high I just end up going to sleep for like 8 hours.  How many of you get this response to stimulants and what does it mean? My Doctor said it's common for people who have ADHD, but what about the people with ADHD who can't sleep when they get their dose upped or feel like they're speeding? What's the difference between them and me? Any info on this mystery would really interest me. I've also heard people say it's bullshit before but if it is why am i getting this sort of response? :|

He said that people with ADHD can't focus on anything, regardless of whether they find it interesting or not. I thought that he was wrong about that but I didn't argue. He also said my procrastination was due to poor planning but he did refer me so there's that.
20dc9af9dca726f6fee1a47eade399fb51b364b2f1cfbccbc7a1b58a43216360;;;My ADHD fiance (23m) has just been offered a promotion at work (IT), but the shift will be nights rotating 3-4 12 hour shifts a week. I'm worried the change in structure and routine is going to affect him negatively.;;; **tl;dr:**He works in IT, and at 23, he's juggling 40 hour workweeks with a *full time* college schedule on top of that. His schedule is about to change to night shifts 3/4 days a week and I'm worried the change in structure will overwhelm and hinder his schoolwork/job.    Hi everyone. I'm undiagnosed ADHD (won't get insurance until january, I digress), my fiance is currently being treated for his with 25mg Adderall XR(generic) daily. It's doing wonders. He's doing SO well, but it took us years to get to this place. He's being offered a promotion that would allow him 3-4 days off per week to focus on school, but it'll be night shifts. I would love to hear some experience or advice on how to handle this so that he doesn't get completely overwhelmed with such a huge change.    Backstory:   His parents were anti-medication, neglectful and play favorites (N-mom, his sister is the GC and he's the step-son of her dad...not a good history). He was raised to focus on sports and his parents never pushed him to do well or get good grades....so when he quit sports his life spiraled into a mess.   For 4 years, his parents enabled him and watched him fail semester after semester of college. He would sit in his car all day staring into space rather then going to class. They never did anything to address the issue, and because they were anti-meds, he quit his medication (he was diagnosed at age 20) and his life got even worse. When he was diagnosed, the medicine helped, but the negativity from his family did nothing to encourage his efforts in school, and his parents didn't seem to care about his grades, only that he pass (which he didn't, because of the lack of support).   We moved in with eachother last year, and it changed both of our lives for the better. We learned about ADHD together. About what to do, how to structure life, the necessity for routine, and it has helped. I have 2 ADHD sisters and both of my parents are undiagnosed. I didn't notice the symptoms in myself until recently, because I'd spent my life overcompensating for everyone else in my family. Anyway he got back on medication last december and with structure, routine and coping mechanisms, his life is skyrocketing into success.   Fast forward to now:  -I have my degree(Biology) as of May 2013, but I'm unemployed. It's been rough finding a job. We're relying solely on his income until I find something.  -He enrolled himself into a college here in an IT program. He went from being a barista, to a temp, to an entry-level analyst for a huge IT company within less than a year. He's been working hard and it has been paying off majorly.  -He will have completed 35 credits by the end of this semester, and is on track to earn his associates in his field by next december/spring 15. This is a huge accomplishment, considering last November he was at a dead end job with no future in sight.    His current schedule: M-F, 7a-4p.  His new schedule: S-W/S-T alternating OR W-Sat/Th-Sat alternating, 7p-7p.(he doesn't know which yet). It's the alternating thing that scares me. It adds just a small amount of change to his schedule that worries me.   If he takes this position, I'll start applying to night shifts in order to try to stay on the same schedule and maintain our routine together. We'll make it work.  Next semester, he will be taking 12 credits. 7 of those credits will be earned within the first 8 weeks of the semester, so it will be a LOT of very hard work. Do you think the extra days off will help or hinder him in this? He seems to think it'll help, because he can focus his day on the schoolwork (he can never study during the week because he's burned out from a day at work, so I agree).    Of course, he'll likely get a significant raise, which would really help us. But my concern is his personal growth.   Less work days might be a good thing, but I need to hear it from you guys. Any insight would be appreciated, and I'm sorry this is so scattered. I just need some reassurance.
58d7526daf1128b64392e76e672122b6f843cba05b489047cad1966ece455587;;;Is it possible to have a 3.7 psychology concentration GPA, 2.1 economics concentration GPA, *and* ADHD? My doctor doesn't think so.;;;I have a feeling my doctor doesn't believe that I really have ADHD, despite the fact that I was diagnosed with ADHD-PI by a psychologist. Why? She cites my 3.7 GPA average for my psychology courses (at a top 30 US university) as evidence against that and blames my 2.0 average for my economics, neuroscience, and chemistry courses on me not being "interested enough." She thinks that my 3.9 GPA in high school is evidence against my diagnosis. She also thinks that the main problem I have is anxiety and difficulty coping with imperfection.  My side of things? Sure, I have a stellar GPA from high school. But you know how much I studied for each test and final exam? Literally maximum of 2 hours, if that. I coasted through high school, sometimes not even studying for math and physics exams because it just "made sense" to me and I would figure things out as I took the test. I read through powerpoints *one* time, and that was all I ever needed for the most difficult tests.  Then came college. Suddenly, you couldn't pass the chemistry, economics, and neuroscience exams by studying an hour the morning of the exam. I couldn't even manage a B- in most of these more difficult courses if I studied for 3 hours a day because I completed about 20 minutes of work in those 3 hours (being serious here). I worked *so hard* for the most difficult courses, spending 5-6 hours everyday in the library 2 weeks before exams, only to spend 95% of that time staring into space daydreaming, staring at my notes daydreaming, or surfing the internet mindlessly.  I admitted to my doctor that spending over 35 hours a week in a library and failing to get more than 2 hours' worth of work done would lead me to have a little breakdown once the week was done. I don't cry everyday. I would work as diligently as I could, trying to rein in my focus for those hours. If I failed one day, no problem, I would do better the next day. I had so much resolve. But I really think that my crying for 20-30 minutes one day after 30-40 hours (in a week) of ineffective studying is not a sign of my inability to cope with hardship. I think that is an extremely *normal* response.  I have such a high psychology GPA because I've done the same for those courses as I did for my high school courses, and I've done well. Face it, psychology is a walk in the park.  My doctor thinks that because I'm so interested in psychology (I'm attempting to apply to psychology PhD programs) and not interested in other courses, that must be the reason I get a 2.0 average in literally all other courses. I don't believe this is true because I've experienced the same struggle with my psychology thesis. I know a PhD isn't going to be all fun and games, it's going to require hours of boring data coding and management and other tasks that aren't extremely amusing. There are hardly any long term goals I can attain if I want to completely ignore the "not fun" side of things.  It's so frustrating for my doctor not to believe that I have ADHD. I would like her to work on a treatment plan with the assumption that I *do* have ADHD. How do I deal with this?

I feel like i'm more social, not as emotional, a slight sense of loose thought and not this robot feeling i felt before. At the same time though i i'm lacking academic wise, and im procrastinating way more often then i should. I'm getting lazy and careless but i don't want to lose my sense of my social and personality if i do change my dosage. I know if i change my meds up i'll hopefully do better but i don't want to feel this robot feeling and this hollowed out sense of identity i had when i first took them. I've been taking meds for 8 years now and i don't know what to do. Tbh im scared since its been bugging me for weeks now. Any help would be great.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;First time poster. Recently diagnosed at 34.;;;So, I don’t want to make this too long (not my whole life story), but I have never posted anywhere about this.  It still might fall in to the TLDR category, so, sorry.  Growing up in the 80's, I was never diagnosed with ADHD but all the signs from back then point to it.  I was tested and put in the gifted program, but not for ADHD?  Anyway...  Always had problems concentrating on one thing, getting distracted, not finishing things, ignoring deadlines / due dates.  I never graduated high school, have picked away at college (54 credits) and have managed to keep the same pretty well paying job for over 10 years (I work from home and set my own on the road appointments, which helps - even though I am usually late).  I am constantly analyzing things, thinking about things, having random thoughts in my head - multiple thoughts, all at the same time.  If I am doing something work related, and get distracted from it, I'm lucky if I get back to it within a few hours, if at all.  This has led to some anxiety and depression (diagnosed with dysthymia as well).  It's more for me dwelling on all the missed opportunities / mistakes / dwelling on the past.  I have no drive, no motivation, no goals, and I still can’t figure out what I want out of life.  So, the psychiatrist I am seeing put me on Strattera (2x40mg in the morning - starting with just 1x40mg for the first five days) in August.  All it did was made me a zombie.  All I wanted to do was sleep.  I didn’t eat, lost 10-15 pounds, had even LESS motivation and drive.  It got to the point where I spent a weekend on the couch feeling worthless, hopeless, and didn't want to move.  So I stopped taking it.  The Dr has now prescribed Ritalin (1x10mg in the morning and 1x10mg after lunch).  I am on my second day.  The first day, about 30-45 minutes after taking it, I felt sleepy.  I was unable to function.  I couldn't concentrate on anything and had no interest to do anything.  I took the second pill after lunch and again felt tired.  Although, this time, I could concentrate on things - just not what I was supposed to be doing.  So, I figured I would pop a third (thinking maybe my dose was too low)....same results.  Around 8 or 9 PM when it wore off, I got a bunch of energy, starting cleaning, doing laundry and organizing things.  I then got super hungry and ate a 6' sub.  I was still hungry and went and got a burger from Wendy’s right after...I never eat like this.  Went to bed at midnight and woke up at 8 Am without an alarm.  Today (day 2), I took the first 10mg at 8:30.  I was a little sluggish but was about to be productive from 10 Am until lunch.  I took the second pill at 12:30 and the same as yesterday...I was in a Wikipedia hole for 3 hours and didn’t even realize it.  Around 3:30-4PM I got severe anxiety, my sense of touch was hypersensitive (was somewhere between pain and tickling – that annoying feeling), and I was, for lack of better words, semi-tweeking.  I took a shower and headed out.  Again, around 4-5 hours after my last dose, I started to feel energized, got a bunch of shit done, and ate like a pig.  Has anyone ever experienced anything like this?  I wanted to try Adderall from the get go, but I guess most Drs use this as a last resort
f265904c82ee0f8c32fa3dc3263f41db666f905d6b4fb515c48d92955d44145a;;;I truly love this subreddit, but there's an issue I'd like to address.;;;I've noticed a pattern in r/ADHD.  Nearly every time I've seen anyone say anything remotely positive about their outlook as someone with ADHD, more often than not, they get downvoted to all hell.   Yes, living with ADHD can really suck.  Fortunately I've got it under relatively good management at 24, but going undiagnosed for 19 years really screwed me up in terms of confidence, self-esteem/-efficacy, grades, etc.     It's important to have a place to vent and to seek comfort in knowing you're not alone, and this subreddit is truly great for that.  But I really don't think people deserve to be downvoted for or discouraged from trying to find and appreciate their own positive traits, regardless of whether or not one could attribute it to their ADHD.  **If you can't see a reason why anyone would see anything positive about having ADHD, that's fine.  But if someone else has managed to take a positive outlook on it, don't discourage them from doing so by downvoting them or making them feel bad about it.**  Granted, if you feel their claims are unrealistic to the point of being unhealthy, offer your perspective.  But for goodness sake, don't be a jerk about it.    I didn't really start to tackle my ADHD until I felt like some good could come out of it.  I felt hopelessly afflicted.  Once I found a way to take a more positive perspective, I felt capable of doing something about it.  If somebody thinks they've found that positive "something," whatever it might be, let them have it.  It just might be the thing they need to get themselves back on their feet, whether you agree with them or not.  **EDIT:** I'm glad this resonated with some of you.  I encourage those of you who agree to remind people of this general idea when you see this behavior happening.  If you don't want to type it up, you can always link to this thread or the comments.  In general, lets just try to keep our subreddit the supportive, friendly, helpful and informative place it should be.  *Please note:*I do want to clarify that if a post, be it positive or negative, is paired with being condescending, preachy or generally obnoxious, positivity doesn't negate that.
6ece1d462d12cd19350fd2770a7aaf115e7f658338eeff0ed3021bd6c1ef6adb;;;I just got diagnosed. Is anyone willing to answer a few questions?;;;A bit of background: I was diagnosed PDD-NOS as a kid, was reevaluated around 14yrs old and given an autism diagnosis, and now apparently I have ADHD too. And "moderate" anxiety. And "moderate" depression. I'm actually quite amused at how screwed up my brain is.  Anyways, I have a few questions about ADHD and a few related things.  My psychologist told me that fish oil could help. I did a bit of research but couldn't find much reputable evidence in support of fish oil as a treatment, and [this article](http://adhdrollercoaster.org/adhd-medication/fish-oil-and-adhd-what-is-the-evidence/) seems to indicate that it's only useful for a subset of people with ADHD (if it's even useful). Does anyone know if there's reputable research on the subject?  My psychologist also told me that medication was not very effective - it looks like he was referencing [the study discussed in this article](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323368704578593660384362292). Is there any merit to this argument? What are the proven benefits to medication, if any?  I also have a bit of a dilemma. I'm willing to try medication if it could actually help with my various ADHD symptoms, but my mother is rather strongly against them (although rather ironically she doesn't raise an eyebrow at the amount of caffeine I consume). Is it worth pressing the issue, or should I wait until next fall when I'll be in university to consider the medication option?  I have mixed feelings over the medication issue... I want to try it, but I feel like a junkie for wanting to try it... I don't even want it for academic reasons, my grades are fairly good... It's just the thoughts, the endless torrent of them... The lack of motivation... Constantly being distracted by trivial things... I want something that could help, but I'm also conflicted over if wanting to take drugs to reduce these symptoms is really important when I've managed them for 18 years *without* drugs... I don't really know how to explain *why* I'm so conflicted coherently... I think this ties into my avoidance of disability resources so far... I really, really want to believe that I don't need "help" to succeed, and I feel like both disability resources and drugs would be cheating in a way precisely because I'm *already* able to meet the standard and produce reasonably high quality work, at least so far in high school and community college classes.
cd5d58ce35e84f504070525f450e1342c224b7341a8734c720d1b7235e1f57ec;;;Going to (potentially) get diagnosed tomorrow and I need some support.;;;I'm 19 and I've suspected that I've had ADHD for a while now (both my mother and brother have it) and I finally got around to seeing my GP to get him to refer me to a psychiatrist for a consult, and my appointment is tomorrow.  My GP suggested I bring along some school reports, I guess to give insight into my grades/how I behaved in the classroom. I just pulled out all my old reports, and after reading them, I am freaking out.  When I was very young, I absolutely adored school. I put in 100% in everything I did, I got good grades, teachers loved me and was always "a delight to have in their class." This was pretty consistent until nearing the end of high school, where my grades were decent but not excellent. Now that I'm at university they are average. It's nearly impossible for me to get motivated to do something unless it's due the next day, and I've started submitting assignments late which I have NEVER let myself do before. I have very high expectations for myself, but then just don't follow through and I can't figure out why.  Basically, I am absolutely terrified that the way I coped with primary and secondary schooling, coupled with "normal, lazy, university student behaviour" will cause the psychiatrist to conclude that I don't have ADHD. I really want help and the idea of someone telling me that I don't need it is making me break down and I can't stop crying.  If you have experience with this/how a psychiatrist goes about diagnosing adult ADHD, any insight would be greatly appreciated.  TL;DR Freaking out that my good grades in school will work against me in getting diagnosed, does this actually happen? What other factors do they take into account when diagnosing?

The Adderall is working great and people around me definitely notice a difference as well!  However, even though my meds are as-needed does anyone have any tips on how to not risk getting dependent on these?
f259531366654c2a66a0ab32ab06394daed51741dba1ce49a09a22d277ab78a4;;;Cant tell if sensei doesnt choose me because I know the material or if its related to my accommodations or if I'm just overreacting?;;;One of my college courses is first year Japanese, and this is my first term of having DRC accomodations for my ADHD. My psychologist, psychiatrist, and I agreed it was a good idea and that it may help me during exams and math classes especially but to help my college experience in general. Basically I can choose which classes to use them in if any, and I can choose to take exams/quizzes separately, have time and a half on exams, have a note taker, and/or receive lecture material ahead of time. Oh, and I think I can audio record lectures too, but I don't use that.   I chose to set my Japanese class as one of the courses I wanted to use my accommodations in, I think I set it for exams and advance lecture material, but wasn't too picky about the lecture material thing. It's not quite as handy as I'd hoped, but it's nice...   The way our class is set up, we go twice a week, three hours one day, two hours the other day. Three hour class, first hour is in English. Remaining four hours are Japanese only. Each hour we have a different sensei as well...  While my senseis are informed via email I have accommodations, they're not informed of what exactly I have that gives me those accommodations. My problem is with my first hour sensei on Thursdays. In the Japanese hours, we aren't called on in the traditional sense. We don't raise our hands when we know the response and get called on, our senseis will do a total deer in a headlight fashion and all of a sudden "(insert Japanese question or statement or whatever here).... Moonstone-san!"   So anyways, my first hour Thursday sensei... week one I got to class a bit late because I didn't know where class was (first week or two the Thursday hours were in a different room), and none of my senseis seemed to realize I had the accommodations which was fine, they had the email and I'd rather talk about things later as needed. Sensei calls on me plenty.... Week two - four he realizes who I am and starts giving me a printed copy of the slide show at the beginning of class. (I feel a little shy about this because it draws attention to me)  Please note, we only have him the first hour Thursday, no other times. I feel like ever since week two he's called on me less and less in class since he started giving me the print outs. He scores me VERY well though (aside from week one for being late and nervous/forgetful)... we're scored in each Japanese hour by each sensei... well, this was the end of week four, and he only chose me 3 times in his hour.... I know that sounds stupid, but each week it seems to be less and less and then today it was 3 times... however, he scored me really well again today.. I guess I should be happy he isn't calling on me much, but he called on EVERYONE in class waaaaaaay more than me, including going back over classmates after he'd called upon everyone but me....  We made eye contact and he would still call upon everyone but me, and eventually I showed in my expression and how I was at my desk how bored I looked/felt because I'd like to be chosen as well to answer responses... nothing...  Next hour, our sensei called on me more times in.the first.like 10 minutes than previous sensei did in an.entire hour.... she scores me very well too though... to get a high score or full points (I generally receive 8/10, 9/10 or 10/10 each hour, its very rare for me to receive lower) you've demonstrated that you really know the material.... I have a low A in the class, it sounds like I'm one of the only ones left who didn't switch to pass/no pass, and despite how nervous I get, I do feel fairly confident in my knowing the material... but even so, hes the only one who seems to call upon me less and less, and I can't figure out why....  I worry that maybe its just coincidental and that I could just be overreacting and.worrying over nothing, but I still can't help but feel confused? Is it because I have accommodations? Is it because I seem to know the material? Is it all in my head?   There's two higher up senseis that you contact about problems and other such things, and I emailed one asking if we could set up an appointment to meet because I wanted to discuss something over a recently graded homework assignment and that I also wanted to discuss a concern of mine regarding the Thursday sessions, but I cant help but feel like I'm being ridiculous.  I guess alongside wanting to vent, I wanted to ask if anyone else has experienced anything like this and if maybe it's all in my head or if this is worth voicing my concerns?  TL;DR: Feeling ignored by one of my senseis in Japanese class, feeling like since he received my accommodations thing from the DRC that maybe that's the reason he's not giving me the attention he's giving my classmates, and I want to be chosen to answer things as well... but also wondering if maybe its just coincidental or maybe it's that he thinks I know the material really well or something? Idk... can't stop feeling like I'm being ridiculous...
50a8e28500ba2dfee83d65848f3bc76202e86b8b1565b2aa387aa0268aae2070;;;How do I get to the point in a letter?;;;So, as you may all know, being verbose and rambling is something we have to deal with daily (and avoid if in any professional setting)  Now I'm trying to write up what may be the most important letter of my life - An application letter for a developer bootcamp and I don't know how to get to the point. Well, to be fair, it's the part of the application letter but the first part, the introduction, where I present myself, ask questions about them and start a conversation, to which if deemed suitable, an application will follow...  So I have the questions noted down but I don't even know how to get started writing something like this and I fear my, as above clearly displayed, ramblings will be a hinderance. It should be stated I don't ramble when talking in person, it's just the writing is a monologue and that's where my brain spins out of control..  So far on topic at least, and **TLDR**: How do I present myself and ask questions in a letter without rambling? Does anyone else have these kind of issues with writing, and how do you get around it/use it to your advantage?
3112e3e3a7f204cc50dc580d308808070479b718a6dcef2b9a0708a18d3a4177;;;Time to start over;;;TL; DR: Glad to be here, long time coming, hoping to change my life  ("Holy wall of text, Batman!"  "Yes, but at least he put it at the top so we don't have to scroll down.")  Hello, everyone, my name's /u/rjshirts and I have ADHD.    "Hello, /u/rjshirts."    Wow...  it feels good to get that off my chest.  I've always been that kid that no one understood why I wasn't as successful as I "should" have been.  I drove teachers crazy because I could pass just about every test, but would never do homework of any sort.  I was reading college level books by 4th grade, but got bored in class.  I took the ACT as a sophomore in high school and pulled a 29 with no studying at all.  Like many others here (it seems), I also had problems keeping friends because I had a complete lack of social skills.   In spite of all that, I finished high school and graduated with honors (miraculously).  I spent 2 years in Eastern Europe and learned to speak Romanian fluently, then came home and married the most wonderful woman in the world.  Even more miraculous, we're about to celebrate our 11th anniversary at the end of the year.  (Yes, even someone like us can have a long-term relationship).   Now, things have not been easy to say the least.  College was HARD.  I nearly flunked out my first term (yes, you can get a GPA under 1.0), something I can now see was directly tied to this condition.  With the assistance of my wife, truly the  most amazing woman in the world, I completed my Associates Degree.  Then I stumbled on a school that was perfectly set up for someone like myself - self-paced and online.  I didn't get bored any more and absolutely FLEW through classes.  In three years I completed a Bachelors in Education, a Masters in Education, and an MBA.    But something still wasn't right.  I've been fired from a number of jobs, and nearly fired from the one I'm in right now.  Someone thought I had ADHD early in my marriage and started me on Straterra and (for me) it was completely useless.  I brushed it off as me just being lazy and trying to take the easy way out, saying to myself that I needed more discipline in my life.  So I tried to join the Marines as an Officer.  Yeah, that didn't go over well...  So fast forward 6 years.  I went in to a doctor for a sinus infection earlier this week and as we started talking he started asking a lot of what I felt were random questions.  When I stopped him and asked how these questions related to a sinus infection, he replied that over the course of the last few visits he had begun thinking that I might have either an anxiety disorder or ADHD.  As he started pouring on the questions, asking about everything I've laid out above, he said that my anxiety and depression issues might very well be from ADHD.    So today I started Adderall XR.  I'll admit, it scares me a bit taking a drug that has the word "amphetamine" in it, probably from hearing way too much about "Breaking Bad" (Maybe I should watch that show some day).  Time will tell how things go, but I'm determined to get myself into mental shape, as it were.  Anyway, I just wanted to say that as I've been pouring over this sub the last few days, it makes me feel better than I'm not alone in being a 32 year old that's finally trying to take control of my life.

I've noticed mouth dryness, shakiness, a weird feeling in my teeth/gums, and decreased appetite.  I've been drinking coconut water for more electrolytes, flossing/brushing more(still have a bad taste in my mouth), and trying to eat healthy small meals.   I've heard stories about hair loss, skin aging, and teeth problems and they scare me! I'm a 29 year old female and don't want to be smelly breathed and wrinkled lol.   I figured since I just started I should ask those of you with more experience. Thanks in advance. And it is helping a ton, just want to avoid the bad stuff.   Edit: I totally understand everyone is different but I'd love your advice either way.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Suggestion "official" ADHD meetup/event day.;;;**TL;DR:** International adhd meetup day that any one can organize an event at. (sorry for bad english)   So I was sitting in front of reddit thought that it would be nice to meet some fellow ADHDers in person. in order to do so i thought a /r/ADHD  meetup would be great.   However it soon dawned on me that it would be a lot of hard work figuring out who I should cater this event to (I'm kind of a Jack of all trades so I would love a lan, beach, and masquerade party with free beer ) and that the most of you probably don't have the ability to make it to sweden So I realised that i needed to rethink the Idea.  **This** is what I have come up with so far and a lot will probably change since I'm putting the you in charge.   1. Time and date: I Think it should be a saturday between the weeks 25 and 30(mid june to mid july)and recur every year at the week number we decide.  2. Any one can make any kind of event at any magnitude.  3. The day should have a suitable name.  4. It would be nice if the moderators could put the date in the sidebar  5. We will probably need to create another subreddit for this in the future if the mods think /r/ADHD becomes too flooded with event posts.  So if you like this idea of an international adhd meetup day please make it happen.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;doctors have failed me for five years....today I feel truly heartbroken.;;;25F ADHD-PI (I'm part of the underdiagnosed group of women who don't seem like they have adhd because it's not as externalized...I was quiet, followed the rules, and got good grades in high school because I have a good short term memory and ability to "hyperfocus"...but as a child they were always sending me to have my hearing tested, and in my late teens I got in two car accidents, due to inattentiveness. I don't have any doubts about my adhd diagnosis, and a few other people in my family have it as well, including my dad.   HISTORY   2008 - Freshman year of college, I suspect I have adhd so I go to a primary care doc for a referral to a specialist....this doc decides I'm just depressed and prescribes me 40mg Prozac (he said that too many docs are afraid to prescribe an "effective" dose) - I take it for a few months and just sleep all the time - lose a relationship and almost fail out of school because of it. then I am switched to Zoloft by a different doc because it will be more "activating"...  2009 - A few months after beginning Zoloft (which didn't have much of an effect on me) I have what vaguely resembles a "manic episode" where I don't sleep much for a week and spend too much money...because of this I am diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and switched to Lamictal....stayed on Lamictal for 6 months and it did absolutely nothing for me other than make me sluggish/fat and killed my personality. I decided on my own to quit taking Lamictal and just save up to see a specialist for ADHD assessment.   2010 - Finally see a specialist, pay $500 out of pocket, go through intensive questionnaires and interviews, have my family and closest friends interviewed, and end up walking out with an official diagnosis of adhd - what a relief...only then I go to doc to get a prescription and the only thing this campus doc will prescribe is Ritalin...and only so long as I take Lamictal as well because of my prior (mis)diagnosis of bipolar. I tried this combo for a while and found that Ritalin didn't work for me and I hated being on Lamictal....at this point I gave up and went unmedicated for a couple of years - surviving but not thriving.   2012 - Barely graduated from college. Went abroad for a year and became depressed - was prescribed Wellbutrin which helped me get out of the bed in the morning but slowed down my cognitive and motor skills, gave me mild anxiety, and possibly made my adhd worse.  Took it for only a couple of months.   TODAY - I finally get set up with a sliding scale clinic (I'm uninsured), and after having spent the three previous Friday mornings waiting on "standby" for the only mental health care specialist they have I get in to see him today....I've been on a mission to finally get stimulants (something that isn't Ritalin or Wellbutrin) and I thought I had jumped through all of the hoops, I had been so patient when so many times I just wanted to give up out of frustration. And what does this doctor fucking do? He decides I have anxiety and prescribes me Celexa....he dismisses my adhd, calling it "mild"....  I do not have an anxiety disorder...I've never had a panic attack, I don't feel overwhelmed or crushed by anything other than my adhd, I have no problem sleeping or eating, I'm a generally happy, hopeful, and calm person....I do have mild depression but that is directly related to the feeling of worthlessness I get from having adhd. I explained all of this to him and he still said that my "mood disorder" is much more serious than my adhd....how can he say that when my adhd is what is ruining my life? I'm not suicidal...but if I were to take my own life it would be because I'm tired of living with untreated adhd.   I wonder if I just take the Celexa and prove to him it's not working then I can get him to switch me to a stimulant eventually (I'd really like to try Vyvanse)....but I don't even want to take the Celexa after my past experiences with antidepressants - they always just made things worse.   I don't know what to do, I feel like doctors don't even listen to me. Any advice? Thanks for reading.

We built it four months ago initially for sharing voice memos amongst our friends, but we had someone with ADHD join who said it's been great for implementing and sticking to a routine.

bbc2f3d80d5ba0d653d026866735b93b57dcad86f439b91a3ea675d4ee556dcf;;;Establishing Perspective on this sub;;;**TLDR: Don't bother reading if critical thinking isn't your thing**  Since I discovered on my own that I had ADHD at 32 years of age and still unmedicated for reasons I'm not even gonna tap on because I'm still angry, it has been extremely difficult coming to terms with not only psychologically, but physically and financially as well.   Unfortunately, in the year that I have subscribed to /r/adhd, I feel almost alone in the sense that everyone has been diagnosed at some point, with a few exceptions however. Even so, I see many of you who have been in relationships, had stable jobs, got married even, figured out your niche, and basically found your happiness. Unfortunately for me, most of these concepts are still foreign to me. I grew up in a poor and broken home and a lot of the shit I had to deal with growing up, I wouldn't put on my worst enemy, one of countless regrets I live with was hanging out with OG thugs. but hey they'd take a bullet for me so they had loyalty. The education system did nothing to help my disability because let's be honest the public education level in this country is 27th in the world in science and math. This uncomfortable truth was only extenuated by the fact that educated doctors, teachers, and my own parents for that matter were too ignorant and uninformed themselves to see the problem right before their eyes. Everything that who I am today I've been forced to figure out on my own. And for someone suffering from ADHD, anxiety, and depression, not having external structure in your life can generally lead to three conclusions: homeless, prison, or worse... suicide.  So one of the things that I learned over the past year in my self introspection and inflection here is it has become more difficult to relate to many of these stories, simply because I have no basis for comparison for being on medication ever, and many of the threads indicate that most of you had structure in your family or at least the finances to take the necessary steps to do this. I guess because my circumstances have been a lot more extreme than any of yours I sometimes disregard anyone's sympathy for me, because I hate sympathy or empathy for that matter,   But you know what I haven't heard on this sub ever? A tragic story similar to mine where it ends up with a happy ending. I've yet to read that one story regarding the individual who has been alone their entire life, been involved in illegal shit, shot at, was suicidal, been unemployed the last 7 out of 10 years, didn't have the support from family or friends because he/she alienated themselves from the people closest to them. Yet somehow later in their life figured out a way to get past all the mental walls and gain control of their lives. It wasn't until I started expanding my research onto the anxiety and depression subs where it indicated to me that the ADHD sufferers I'm describing end up there when the problem with their ADHD becomes exasperated, largely in part because anxiety and depression is the end result of long term ADHD being untreated. I wonder if anyone else has gone out of their way to read other individuals situations in those subs because it offers a lot of perspective and insight at the reality of what these co-morbid disorders can do to someone.  There's so many different facets that I can tackle where I'm going with this, but because of my ADHD i'm too busy jumping from topic to topic to focus on my self anymore because these issues have become more important:      -people don’t know their vote trumps mandated law      -citizens united      -shitty congress with lifelong benefits      -war on drugs      -private prisons paid for with taxes      -out of control financial sector      -ever decreasing civil liberties      -uninformative and misleading media      -still largely apathetic population      -2 party system that is essentially 1 party      -publication bias in pharmaceutical research      -censorship of the internet      -devastation to our health      -devastation to our ecosystem  Even though I have no control over any of the bigger issues that the world is facing, it none the less paints a vivid picture why I became the individual I am today. Because I suffered so much, I can actually see the world for what it really in all its facets: the corruption of government, the suffering and disenfranchised of the poor. the greed that has consumed the politicians and education system in this country. The torture, the lies, the over prescribing of drugs (yes it happens for the most part when greed is involved). By all means, take a look at my post history and you'll soon uncover how I really feel. I got a propensity for verbosity, but aren't all of us :p?  The only positive thing I can say about my ADHD is that it allowed me to jump from issue to subject like the frequency of a cheap pan radio. Everything fascinate me in all it's beautiful and cruel form, and I mean all of them. Is this what happens to individuals such as me who can't focus on one topic but can be generalized in all of them? I don't know, I've yet to read post where I could relate to someone else. It could simply be because they don't browse Reddit, don't know that they have ADHD, live in another country without internet, or in prison wondering how they got in there in the first place. All I know is, ignorance is bliss, and I wish I didn't know so god damn much information because of the painful truth it brings. And I wish the ADHD wouldn't fuck up my short term memory so much that whenever I argue with someone regarding an issue that I'm familiar with I can't recall most of that information but I know I'm right I just can't remember how I'm right but by then they already pegged me for being arrogant and dismiss anything I have to say after that. It'll drive your anxiety into overdrive and hammer the depression home. But if I don't, I'm even more depressed for not knowing. It's a double edged sword.   I just wish there were other who I can sit down with and have coffee with and talk about various topics of life: Obama signing section 1025 of the National Defense Authorization Act on New Year's Eve. Or why I explain how caustics subdivision on my V-Ray renders takes 2 hours instead of 3 because I never was good at Calculus. And then talk about this fucking good book ["The War of Art"](http://www.amazon.com/The-War-Art-Through-Creative/dp/1936891026/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1382739562&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+wart+of+art) that challenges the creative aspects of our brain to counter the negative resistance we experience internally. then change topics to the ancient site of Göbekli Tepe which has been carbon dated to being over 12,000 years old, which would basically rewrite the history books if this is completely true. And then maybe finish off the subject to how you are doing and how you have been, because the chameleon inside me would kick in at this point and I'd rather focus your problems than mine, because to me your issues are easier to solve.  Look... before anyone even thinks it, I'm not looking for empathy or any other type of sympathy, in fact because of my foolish pride, I resent anything that resembles pity. But it's also one of my biggest faults, I realize that, but please... spare me any type of "it's Ok, it will get better" type of nonsense, that's not my goal nor do I want or need it. Where I was going with this rant I honestly don't know, it started off with a focused direction, but I got lost in the details, and now I'm summarizing it with a completely different viewpoint. I guess what I initially was asking is how bad can it get if someone goes undiagnosed for so long. But I already knew the answer to that with my own investigative research, I just found it puzzling that I never once heard of something facing the trial by fire process and go through unscathed.  EDIT: no edits today, leaving as it is because sometimes I like to analyze my rants and focus where I made mistakes on the grammar, run on sentences, comma splices, double use of words, etc. Leaving the editing for later  God damn I need to stop writing...
34eb874f75224e8bcd99a7e2e5314a9b0ea7f7140d184989bc1b5283bf2e5370;;;Saw doctor for one month check-in;;;Actually I've seen him a couple of times since he prescribed the Ritalin, but specifically to focus on this stupid kidney infection. Today was the scheduled check in to talk mostly about how it was going with the Ritalin. Just thought I'd update everyone....   I told him how very happy I am with it, and only wish I'd tried it sooner! It's made such a dramatic impact, especially with mental clarity and productivity towards mental tasks. Have yet to see any relief from fatigue/physical energy, but I am assuming that's the kidney infection, and once that's cleared, I hope to discover improved energy levels too.   He wrote me out a 3 month Rx for more 10 mg, and said once I am feeling better, by all means, go ahead and try a double dose once or twice, if it works, call him and he'll call in an order for a 20 mg pill instead. Proceeded with lengthy explanation of how two 10 mg pills aren't exactly the same as one 20 mg pill, and also said he thinks there is a dose that's in between those two, if 20 mg is too strong but I see no improvement in energy levels on the 10 mg.   He said that if I want to go see a neuropsychologist to get tested for an official diagnosis of ADHD, he would refer me. I said I wasn't sure I'd pass the test - I may not have ADHD but the Ritalin is definitely helping with fibro brain fog. He then said "I've known you a long time; I'm pretty confident you'd pass the test." ha!  Then he said he would continue prescribing it regardless; he only offered the referral in case I had, for example, family members who didn't understand, and needed some "proof." I told him my hubby and family is quite happy with how the Ritalin is working so I didn't think that was necessary.   Then he made me pee in a cup again and expressed concerns that the kidney infection may be resistant to the antibiotic I am on, because I should be feeling a lot better by now. :-(

But honestly the past two sessions I've gone I have no clue what the hell is going on. I keep losing track of the questions I am asked and it's getting increasingly difficult to express myself. I keep contradicting myself when I talk to the therapist. Also, I totally forgot what was discussed at my last therapy session. All I remember is she told me to try and plan out a day with a schedule, but I haven't gotten around to it.
c8b5ec3e3fa543854da867a59a87acf6c3ed77a32a8f751212b0359c49480624;;;How did I mess up my first job out of grad school so badly?;;;I'm in my 30s, diagnosed ADHD combined type less than a year ago, posted before about my work problems a month ago in this post: http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1mtx4u/problems_at_work_even_on_medication/  I graduated with a master's in May after going back to school to change careers into a rehab therapist position. I work with patients in a nursing home. I had high hopes for this job--the pay is good, the facility is pretty and pleasant, and everything seemed good. Then things started going wrong. I don't have enough self-insight right now to figure out exactly how much I contributed to the problems, and how much was just due to weird/difficult work situations beyond my control. The two problems were productivity--taking too much time to do paperwork and not enough minutes with the clients--and interpersonal relationships. It seems like I made a lot of enemies during my 5 months there, and I'm not entirely sure why. If anyone who has experience/insight about ADHD and office politics and wants to PM me, I would be happy to discuss more details in private. On the public thread I want to avoid giving out details that could identify me.   I applied for another job doing the same type of work somewhere else, and got it, so I gave notice to my supervisor. I have a good feeling about my new supervisor so I think I'll get along better with her, but I still feel really sad and disappointed that this job didn't work out. Now that people know at work that I'm leaving, when they ask me about it I have to fight back the tears and feel so embarrassed to be emotional at work. Glad as I am to have found another job, I know I need to understand what went wrong at this one in order to not repeat the same mistakes.   Looking back I can definitely see how some things I did were mistakes, and they were probably due to being impulsive. I have a low tolerance for doing nothing, so I tend to do the thing that seems like a good idea at the time, even if it requires asking someone else for help. When I was new to the job I probably leaned too much on the other departments asking them for help and making special requests, and it didn't take long for them to start complaining about me behind my back and telling stories to my boss, making me sound as bad as possible. Sometimes the patients have complained about me too, saying I'm too perky or too "happy", or too pushy I guess?  But I'm under pressure to spend a certain number of minutes with each patient on my caseload to keep my productivity up, and if they really don't want to work with me I do let them skip it for the day or even quit altogether. Some of the people I work with are dealing with serious health issues and emotional losses, so they are sensitive to little things I don't notice and take offense when I'm cheerful (as is my usual personality). I took it hard when I heard this complaint and have been trying to tone down the perkiness when working with patients, but that makes me feel like a depressed zombie.    I should mention that I seem to have a good rapport with most of the patients I work with, about 80%, and it is only the minority of patients who don't always want to work with me (and these same patients often have issues with the other rehab therapists, too).    Since I posted last I had my dosage of Vyvanse increased to 30 mg. The sense of focus lasts longer into the day and it helps my organization and energy to get things done, but I've noticed being more weepy in the evenings since I increased the dose--could be more of a crash effect as it wears off, or could just be that I am more emotional with all of the changes taking place.  TL;DR Made enemies at work due to impulsivity, and some patients think I'm too perky and positive. How can I get people to like me better at my new job?
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Can people with undiagnosed/untreated ADHD still do well in school?;;;I don't know enough about ADHD to tell whether my problems are the result of bad habits cemented in my brain growing up that are a result of poor mental discipline, or I actually have a disorder. I wanted to know opinions from people who have experience with ADHD. I feel awkward asking a doctor about the possibility of me having ADHD at 19 because I've done fine in school until now.  I have always been a good student until recently. I have a ton of trouble concentrating on subjects that aren't interesting to me. This has always been a problem for me, but I until now the classes I didn't like were mostly easy to pass without a full understanding. I have the intelligence, I just find it impossible to keep my mind on the textbook or professor. I resolve to work hard, and then I find myself thinking about random things as my eyes go across the page or stare at the professor. I get by by learning definitions with flash cards, which isn't hard to do even with a lack of focus. I wonder if ADHD is also an explanation to the many unfixable memory and organization problems I've had since I was little, which my parents passed off as me being an "absent minded professor". I also feel like I've compensated until now by having an affinity for multiple choice tests. I was also an avid reader growing up, which I think gave me a decent ability to guess in tests on books I didn't like so I didn't finish. I also had amazing parents that would study with me and drill things into my head until High school, when independent reading and harder math made it impossible for them to help. Cheating was also rampant in my school, which made it easy to pass classes like Spanish.   Of the memory problems and organization problems, I could never ever keep a folder, planner, decent notes, or a calendar. Teachers have tried to "fix" me since grammar school, but I never managed to get it together. I still miss due dates constantly, which I never do consciously. I constantly zone out when people are talking to me and need them to repeat themselves. I never remember peoples names. I have been on a sports team in my college for 3 semesters, and there are still people on the team that I don't remember their names. I compensate by using "dude" and "man". I have made serious attempts to get organized, but I can't remember to write dates down, and I feel like when I take notes in class I can't get an understanding of the lecture at the same time and end up with notes that are just worse versions of my textbook. The notebook will likely be lost somewhere anyway.   This got into my head because I am failing accounting, and was desperate enough to try adderall from a friend. I was able to study hard for a good 5 hours as if it was a calculus or history class. I know this is the reason college kids abuse adderall and that many people think they have ADHD after trying it, but the fact that these problems have been consistent since I was little and that its social issues as well as studying issues makes me really unsure. My little brother also was diagnosed with ADHD a few years ago, so the genetic factor is there if he was correctly diagnosed.
8cc3b33bed4908c4963c5abd084d02c58c6494ccfeeac1dac9b1a474a20eca84;;;ADHD and restlessness?;;;First time posting here although i've been reading for a while, I've got an appointment coming up soon with a pyschiatrist but I have a question for all you ADHDers out there.   Do you feel restless? I don't know how to describe it but let's say your doing something (studying, writing a paper, etc) and you get a feeling in your stomach and you just have to move and it feels undescribable. It's like a knot in your stomach? You can't focus on anything because you just feel inpatient. Restlessness.  No idea what I typed really but can anybody relate? It generally happens when doing something that requires attention that i can't give.

Then again, we have only been seeing this man for  a little under a month (2 times per week). I don't know what to expect. From my experience working with adults that have impulse control issues, we have managed to use Cognitive Behavioral techniques in conjunction with medication, but so far, she's just been drawing elephants.

From what I've been reading through I'm guessing it's the PI type.  I have some symptoms of the hyperactivity variety but mostly it's the fog.  I've had this since... easily high school but was never treated.  I got by in spite of it.  I've had major problems in certain types of subjects over the course of my education life.  In particular - subjects where I had to memorize anatomy, or subjects where I had to write papers.  Math was always a strong point for me, it was strong enough that I could ignore the noise and work out whatever problems I had in front of me.  Studying has always been a challenge and I've always needed some type of music to keep my eyes on the paper.  I can't tell you how many times I've had to re-read pages because my mind would just wander.  Not just for studying, but even leisure reading.  It's tough.  I'm fortunate that it hasn't affected my abilities to treat patients, I'm actually on my way to becoming an accomplished dentist (not just treating patients but lecturing and teaching).  But I'm finding that it's been getting worse with time, not better.  I thought for a long time I could just work around it but now that I'm putting together lectures and speaking arrangments I'm having a really difficult time sitting still long enough to get my words on paper.  For instance I have to give a lecture in January for 2 hours.  I know the material I need to present but I just can't sit down and do it.  Every time I sit, my mind just wanders like crazy and I can't focus.  I've been trying to work around it by only doing a little at a time and it's working but it's extremely frustrating.  Why am I posting?  I guess support and any suggestions.  I've been trying to book some time with a psych to schedule an ADD test but it's quite difficult in my neck of the woods.  So it's likely to be a few months before that happens.   TL;DR: Dentist with undiagnosed ADD trying to overcome it.  Finding it difficult.

I've been on 80mg of Strattera for a month now, and it initially felt like it was helping, but now I just feel tired all day. Other options my doctor has discussed include a tricyclic antidepressant (didn't catch the name), Wellbutrin, and guanfacine.  Have any adult sufferers had much luck with any non-stimulant drug? I looked at a number of Strattera threads and the impression was generally pretty negative. Wondering if I should continue working with my GP or ask for a referral to a psych and try to get a stimulant prescription.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Having ADHD makes me feel terrible about myself and avoid situations, which actually really help me like extra time on exams and I hate talking about my ADHD-PI to others.;;;I have ADHD-PI  and was diagnosed at the beginning of college (things really went to hell at the beginning of college and I ended up chain-smoking just to be able to focus). I had to cheat like hell before that, barely graduated high school, and my parents did all my work and used to meet with teachers and assure them that I was fine. I'm also a really nice and polite person so teachers gave me  the benefit of the doubt and I am really smart.  Anyways, since I was diagnosed (3-4 years ago) I've felt terrible and insecure about talking about it because people assume i'm smart and that i cant have such an issue. I am terrible at rapid recall, my working memory is pretty bad, i can't really visualize stuff in my head, i read misinterpret and mark things easily (like scantrons) and in order to finish on time i scrawl like a madman and no one can read it. In this quarter of college (my last quarter of college), I finally talked to a professor about the prospect of receiving extra time and I actually ended up utilizing two hours for an examination that was 45 mins.  Obviously it really helped me but even talking about my ADHD makes me feel like shit and extra time makes me feel terrible about myself and i wanted to struggle with everyone else. Also, people always assume that i'm smart and know everything, so it's weird for people to understand I have ADHD. Has anyone else been through these circumstances or similar? How did you resolve it? I feel so bad about myself and gives me bad anxiety and the shakes to even talk about it to most people aside from my doctor. I hate my circumstances even though they have gotten a lot better.  I also hate that it wasn't discovered earlier in my life. it feels like i was living a lie =/.
99ef2ce4a3bf435cb2a82b6e4fedca2fac23ea6dab8337f7648f841005c9df68;;;Effects of medication on creativity;;;Sorry if this has been asked before, but I have to figure out how to get this solved.  I'm a documentary producer, and to be honest, I've been very successful during my career.  I'm 29, have won several major awards, and I've absolutely LOVED my job.  I was diagnosed with ADHD in about 7th grade, was on and off meds through high school, and then didn't take them again until this Fall.  I started with Ritalin/Focalin and couldn't take the highs and lows - I felt bipolar on it - I'd go from these extreme highs, and then absolutely crash.  I recently switched to Vyvanse, first 50mg for 3 weeks, and then this week I bumped to 70.  The 50MG was fantastic, I absolutely loved it - I couldn't feel it come on, and I couldn't feel it leave, but I felt like I needed just a little bit more.  The 70 seems a bit too strong right now though, I've turned into an absolute zombie the last two days.  What I've noticed however is that my creativity and motivation has seemingly plummeted in the last couple weeks.  I have three major projects to finish right now - they're simple, I enjoy working on them, and they'll be pretty decent when they're done.... but I can't even start the process.  I'm a zombie... i sit here and hyperfocus on anything other than work, and the mere thought of trying to think creatively terrifies me.    Could the meds be causing this?  I can only think of one other time i've felt this way, and that was when I was going through a divorce last year and couldn't concentrate on anything....  That leads me to my next variable... within two months of my divorce (10 year marriage), I found myself in a new relationship... I realized it could be a rebound at the time, but damn it felt good, and boy did it get serious FAST... a year later and the relationship is ending and she's moving out in a couple weeks....I've spent the past 3 months trying to salvage the relationship and take care of her emotional needs as well, and it just didn't work... her husband died in a car crash before we started dating, so we were an emotional trainwreck just waiting to happen.  I guess my question is.... what's causing this complete loss of motivation and fear of creativity?  Could it be the medicine?  The depression from basically going through 2 divorces and an insane amount of stress in the past year?  a combination?  I don't want to stop the meds, I think they really do help in a lot of areas - but my livelihood kinda depends on me being spontaneous and creative...  TL:DR  - Feel like I lost my creativity; is it the Vyvanse, depression, or a combination?  EDIT:  Thanks for all the replies guys.  After reading through them, I'm really starting to think it's the depression/anxiety that's causing all of this.  I've noticed that when I absolutely HAVE to get work done, I'm on fire - it's when I have the option of *not* doing work that I can't get motivated.  Instead of editing a project that I need to finish, I just hyperfocus on something else for 8 hours at work.  But, when I actually am forced to work because of deadlines, etc - I've been able to do some of my best work.    Hopefully I can get my depression/anxiety in check and hit the ground running again.  Thanks so much for the replies.

I fell off the medication/treatment train when I was around 17-18. I was always kind of socially reclusive because of other things that are too complicated to go into here.   However, I have become very adept in social situations in the past 2-4 years (I'm 25 now). My only problems are forming complete thoughts fast enough to keep up with conversation (I'm damn good at quick, short wit though) and my confidence (due to those complicated things I mentioned earlier). Overall, I'm fairly sociable and can hold my own in a crowd. Hell, I've been known to steal the spotlight from time to time when I have high energy.   I am a shameless flirt, but I don't flirt much. I'll make small jokes here and there and do stuff like say "Well that's adorable. The dress is cute too. ;)" or something along those lines. However, I seem to be rather dense when it comes to noticing that I'm being flirted with or if I have a girl's attention. Most of the time, my mind is focused on what I need to be doing, so when I break away from that to flirt, I go right back to what I was doing otherwise it'll never get done. Sometimes I'm so focused on what I'm doing, I don't even know if someone's in the same room as me, let alone if they're outright flirting with me.   Does this happen to anyone else? I feel like I can't be the only one.
13c6d41677d3ba5aa962b148c26ac3ccc348defef2343cb9b2c10ca1ad13d99c;;;Hyperactive ADHD question;;;I am curious if anyone out there has/had a super hyperactive type of ADHD. My son is seriously the tazmanian devil when he is unmedicated. Although he is only 9 now, i fear he will be like this forever. Does this type of hyperactivity calm down? will be able to learn to control it or work with it as he gets older?  I always see people post about their ADHD and it seems so calm compared to what we see in my son. No one ever explains that they were like this or are like this.   When I say Tazmanian Devil, i really mean in. This kid is Jekyl and Hyde between on and off meds.
335ce636784c06b104b43967464b618849de96f9a34a75cff0634cf65ed6b8d4;;;Finally diagnosed!;;;I finally went and found a GP who would look at my ADHD. I called close to 10 GPs/Family Doctors in the end before I found one who would take me without a psych referal. I live in a town with two colleges, so there's a lot of drug seekers out there I guess. My GP even joked with me about how many he would see trying to score something.  I almost cried when he diagnosed me. He said he barely had me fill out the self-reporting test he uses, because after reading my chart and seeing me fidgeting and zoning out he kinda assumed it.  I spoke with him for a while and was diagnosed with ADHD-PI and was prescribed 30mg of Vyvanse.   Which, by the way, is expensive as all fuck. Retail price at Walgreens of $230, and the manufacturer coupon from Shire brought it down to about $145. Had to pay out of pocket for now due to holidays and my prescription insurance company running skeleton crews next week, and I needed to have a prior authorization.    So far it's great. I've tried Adderal XR before through my roommate and hated it. It caused ridiculous amounts of insomnia. I'd be wired for 24 hours straight. The constant buzz was nice, but it didn't really help me focus, and it was a literal 'buzz' in my head.    Vyvanse is totally different. It feels so much smoother kicking in, and it's lasting much longer than the Adderall did focus-wise, without giving me the energy of 1000 men.    For once in my life my thoughts feel normal. Fuck you pinball-machine-brain!     I just wanted to thank everyone here at /r/ADHD. I never really posted, but I've been lurking since around March.   **tl;dr** You guys are informative as shit and I love you all! :)

So my question is have any of you found a successful medication or form of therapy that helps you get important things, like assignments, finished on time? I've been struggling to focus for more than 40 minutes at a time.   I will note I can't do stimulants like Ritalin and Adderall(sp?) they increase my heart rate too much and then I become a nervous emotional wreck.  I've set up a calendar to help me remember important dates, and I set up a daily schedule for a while but things never happened as they were suppose to and so that stopped working.  More information about me: Female, 21, second year of college. I rarely drink alcohol, limit my caffeine intake and can't eat dairy/gluten due to dietary intolerance. I don't eat much sugar it dyes unless I have a massive craving for sweets (usually dark chocolate or coconut ice cream).  Any advice or articles that can help would be much appreciated!    Edit: made paragraph breaks more apparent and easy to see.
3b5a15fc164f4a37d981b8eabc2d76f5aa0141d3a076e6fc57980d8c251f0eba;;;ADHD-PI on 10mg Adderall IR 2/day. I think I need to up my dose but I'm afraid of tolerance/addiction problems.;;;A small backstory:  I am the oldest of 3.  My brothers were both diagnosed very early and put on medication.  I am also the only one to "legitimately" graduate high school (it's a long story) and the only one to go to college, and now graduate school.  One is a complete delinquent and the other tries but doesn't succeed the way I have.  For a very long time I blamed this on them using ADHD as an excuse for being bad kids.  I have since learned otherwise through my own experiences but it left a really foul taste in my mouth about prescriptions that makes me really worried about them.  I was diagnosed with ADHD-PI a few months ago after a lot of soul searching, testing, and discussion with counselors and started Adderall IR 10mg 2/day about a month ago.  For the first week or two everything seemed great.  Higher ability to focus when needed, higher ability to get work done, higher motivation and energy, my severe depression almost immediately cleared (though, honestly, that was mostly due to being crappy at my job so being able to do my job probably helped with that).  At my last meeting with my doctor she asked how I was feeling and I was pretty adamant that I didn't feel the need to up my dose and that I was trying to be very cautious.  But now things seem to be slowly slipping.  I am doing better than before but the concentration problems are starting to show.  Distraction in a chaotic environment (I spent 3 hours looking for a quiet place to read on a sunday because I couldn't even focus on the book in a starbucks or some place... ended up reading in my car).  Procrastination due to inability to realistically evaluate the time it takes to do things (I think something will be a breeze so I procrastinate only to find out it takes twice as long as I thought).  Motivation and energy don't come as readily.  Because my doctor said I should use this first prescription to experiment with dosage I tried a 20mg dose.  Obviously the effects were greater, no surprise there.  But how do I know if I actually need to up the dose or if I'm just trying to medicate away other behavioral issues (lazy, procrastination, etc...)?  I'm quite thoroughly afraid of becoming reliant on medication for things the medication is not supposed to be used for.  I'm a trained chemist, I've read the research (in fact it's the first thing I did) and I know I'm nowhere near a "high dose" but I think I need a more personal understanding of when to know enough is enough or how to manage tolerance issues.  I imagine this is a pretty common problem, so I wanted to know what you all think/do about this kind of issue?

Previous posts talked about:  *  [The Causes of ADHD and Effective, Scientifically Validated Treatment, with a goal to summarize what is know about the ADHD](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1ol3ue/there_is_a_lot_of_bullshit_about_adhd_i_wrote_up/)   * [Academic Outcomes Associated with ADHD](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1ouvti/adhd_and_academics_getting_past_the_bullshit/)  * [Comorbidity Associated with ADHD](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1pcfgc/adhd_and_comorbidity/)   * [Accommodations for ADHD](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1qrvoc/accommodations_and_academics_how_to_get_them_and/)  /u/parkhour posted a question on reading [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1rc1iv/i_have_add_and_hate_reading_my_friends_who_have/) and it inspired me to talk about reading and ADHD and reading.   Its time for another article! But this one is on **READING**   Like 60% of people with ADHD have trouble reading. And it can be caused by ADHD and other things. Both of the reasons are prevalent in people with ADHD.    **READING = DECODING**  **Reading is hard. You have to automatically do so many things to get meaning from text.**   * You have to know and be able to recognize that speech is made up of individual sounds. like atoms. (whats the difference between Grow and Glow when said aloud) people who have trouble reading often have difficulty with that. Rhyming is hard too.   * You have to know the smallest units of meaning in a language (what does -ed mean after the word "fart").   * You have to know the rules for combining nouns, verbs, adjectives (Yoda sucks at this).   * You have to know what words mean (vocabulary).   * You have to know what sounds go with what letters.   * You have to know the exceptions (why does ph make the /f/ sound? and colonel for kernal- wtf?)  * You have to be able to do all the stuff above sooo incredibly fluently  **The ability to read goes like this:**  First, when a child becomes aware of the fact that spoken words are made up of sounds; can take the form of awareness of rhyme, awareness of syllabuses, onsets of words, etc  Then you learn that symbols have meaning (two year olds know the McDonalds Arches).   Then you learn that individual sounds go with letters.  Then you learn the exceptions to the rules (seriously english, just spell shit how it sounds. WTF!).  The you are fluent and capable reader.   **In short reading comes down to decoding and comprehension**  That was a super short summary of reading. Its way more complex than that.    **Facts about reading:**  Before third grade, your **learn to read** in school.  After third grade, your **READ to LEARN**.   **Reading is how our society gives us the most academic/background knowledge**   Most people get identified as having a reading disability in after the third grade, because its obvious that you just aren't keeping up.   **In schools about 60-80% of referrals for learning difficulties come from people who are having trouble reading!**      Here is a good definition of Dyslexia:   “a specific learning disability that is **neurological in origin**.  It is characterized by difficulties with **accurate and/or fluent word** recognition and by poor spelling and decoding abilities.  These difficulties typically **result from a deficit in the phonological component of language** that is often unexpected in relation to other cognitive abilities and the provision of effective classroom instruction.  **Secondary consequences** include problems in reading comprehension and reduced reading experience which impedes growth of vocabulary and background knowledge”  Think of dyslexia as having trouble with the mechanics of reading.     **there are four types of reading disabilities or why people have trouble reading:**  1. **Dysphonetic Dyslexia** - these people never mastered the individual speech sounds when they kids. They suck at rhyming, they cant tell the difference between glow and grow, etc. They just dont get that speech is mad eup of individual sounds. They put sounds in weird order when trying to spell, they spell the same word a 100 different times on a page. There is no knowledge of the sound-written symbol connection.   2. **Dyfluent Dyslexia** -  These people can read, they know that individual sounds make up words. But they are slooooooooow, and by the time they get to the end of sentence they forgot what it was about because it takes so long.   3. **Mixed Dyslexia** - This is a combo of the above kind.    4. Has to do with **Reading Comprehension**. Have good decoding skills but difficulty with reading comprehension.  May have poor executive functioning and working memory skills  - difficulty organizing incoming information with previously read material (which leads to poor comprehension). To comprehend you need to be able to retain knowledge and have the flexibility to manipulate it, store it, and retrieve the information later. May have poor language foundation skills and be unfamiliar with words (which leads to poor comprehension). May have poor visual and verbal working memory. Be aware of attention problems.  **The fourth kind is likely the kind of reading difficulties that someone with ADHD will have, if dyslexia is not suspected.**   In summary the different types of poor readers: * Those who can understand it when it’s read aloud by have trouble reading (dyslexia) * Those who can read words accurately but do not comprehend it (poor comprehenders) * Those who have trouble with both   **ADHD is highly comorbid with troubled reading.** But it could be because you have **dyslexia** (as much as 20 percent of people do). Or because of working memory and executive functions and attention!    Having trouble with reading does not mean you are stupid, in fact, **its pretty independent from IQ.** It just means that there is something else going on.   **Red flags of dyslexia:**  * Difficulty learning to rhyme words * Difficulty learning letter names and sounds * Confusion of letters and words with similar appearances (saw and was) * Confusion of letters with similar sounds (/f/ and /v/) * Trouble arranging letters in the correct order when spelling (besauc =   because) * Spelling the same word in different ways on the same page (wunce, wuns = once) * Spelling words the way they sound rather than the way they look (sed for said) * Difficulty pronouncing multisyllabic words * Slow word perception, which affects reading rate and fluency  * Often have strengths in areas not affected by the disorder (e.g., math and science) * Oral language and listening comprehension abilities often higher than reading and spelling skills  * **Research has indicated that intelligence does not predict reading for individuals with dyslexia, but it is a reasonable predictor for individuals without dyslexia**   **Those with good verbal skills often not identified until later**   **Early intervention is critical!!**    **Common Misperceptions:**  * People with dyslexia cannot read * Individuals with high IQ cannot have dyslexia * Dyslexia is seeing things backwards * Dyslexia is rare * Dyslexia cannot be diagnosed until at least 3rd grade * Children will outgrow dyslexia * More boys than girls have dyslexia * All struggling readers have dyslexia * Young children who reverse letters have dyslexia * Ineffective instruction in school can cause dyslexia   IF you think you might have dyslexia, contact a local school psych (a licensed one) or a literacy group. Or PM me!  This actually a very serious topic because NO one should have trouble becoming a good reader (hear me out). This seriously opposite ADHD in terms of a true cure. Through good reading instruction, usually a phonics program, and years of hard work you people with dyslexia can overcome their difficulties. This is one science almost has beat. That along with early ID can really help this LD.    Tldr reading disorders are common with people who have adhd. There are different kinds too.

I'm currently 17 years old and I've started a business that's growing but I'm using it as an excuse to not do any of the other things that I need to do. I only have 2 online classes left of high school, and they're just rotting and about to expire in 10 days. I use to have a high caffeine intake (coffee, soda..etc) that I used to calm myself down, also I've tried Pseudoephedrine which worked but I was also very edgy which distracted me even more.   I'm on Prozac (currently 40mg daily) right now and I don't feel like it's working as much as it should. I don't think about killing myself actively, but I still deep down want to, but I haven't really decided if I want to yet or not.  I was talking to my GP a few weeks ago and I told him that I wanted to get tested for ADHD and he kinda blew me off saying that "we need to get you stable on your depression first." I'm in the process to be switching to a psychiatrist.  TL;DR: I have depression and I want to get tested for ADHD but doctor said he wouldn't test me yet. I'm about to switch doctors, how have you guys dealt with MDD and ADHD?  How can I deal with both at the same time?  What are your experiences with having MDD and ADHD?

I googled it and several sources claim that. How reliable is this, if even true and if, what does that mean? And most importantly: how do i respond to someone who claims that.
c0275673b6f4fa2cba336fffaaaca99946d1cb83d96cab9be3b312ac76c27c74;;;Went to my medication dr/therpist, no meds :( (rant kinda);;;So he thinks this is just a phase of hypo-mania and thats why I'm so happy and shit all of a sudden now that I am off the effexor. The effexor made me pissed as all hell. I kept trying to tell him that this was the way I was as a teen, he kept asking me all the questions like he was trying to diagnose me with bipolar. I'm just like, no, no, no, no, to basically all of his questions. I'm just over active, but unmotivated, constantly bored, but do everything there is to do in the house, I can't sleep, I can't sit still, etc etc.  Then he asks the same questions, do you spend all your money? DO you give things away? blah blah blah.  He really will not give me a stimulant unless I am in college classes. This doesn't help with my now, I don't want my depression and anxiety to come back. I'm finally doing better and I don't want to spiral back down into that hole again.  I'm just kinda lost and need to throw all this out there, sorry. Any advice, I am already going to talk to my counselor about seeing the other Dr in the building, or have her talk to him because she totally gets where I am coming from.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;How did you cope after you were diagnosed, before you got medication ?;;;I live in a country where it's very hard to get medication, due to abuse and societies perception, I'm 41 years old, the diagnosis is very clear for ADD but I've had some problems with alcohol (never drugs) and have been taking some prescription medication - always prescribed by my doctor, so I wouldn't call it abuse (xanax).  I'm on a waiting list to see a doctor who will decide but I'm very worried he will just say no, you are just an alcoholic, stop drinking.  Somehow I've managed to keep a steady job for the past 15 years (changed jobs twice, both times moving upwards) but it's getting harder as the years hit you doing allnighters + my personal finances are a mess - although I make quite a nice salary.  My place is a mess, not sure if I have good friends or not - probably seems like to them I keep ignoring them, cancelling plans etc...    I'm having some very hefty financial problems at the moment, but I'll manage, I can get out of  problems this time.   But this is my last chance, if I keep on as I have I'll be on the street.  Just to be clear I don't drink daily, I've stopped drinking for 3 months straight but often like to have 4-5 beers after work, sometimes they turn out to be more, but I mostly do it because I don't know what to do instead of beering up.  It calms my mind.
6cf346c9ba97fc24468218336e7ed8eae5a1fe4ccd0ec68e7c8c8dfcdbd8d93b;;;ADHD-NOS due to "vision"? what about depression?;;;Hello there! So I was diagnosed with ADHD-NOS (not otherwise specified, meaning its caused by something else) in this case caused by vision problems. I am working on improving my vision but currently I am not on meds since they claim that I am fine w/o them while I learn to work around  my ADHD (which is impossible to just sit down and "Focus" if I don;t want to do the task). My friends believe I am suffering from depression as well but my family doesn't know and such. Is it possible that my depression is causing my ADHD? For those of you with both, what have you been doing to get help? Also how have you managed to convince your parents you can;t just "sit down and decide to finish something in 30 min and then just do it and be done" how can you convince them you need meds?
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;I'm about to graduate college, but I still have very negative feelings about my childhood and experiences I had before it was discovered that I have ADHD. Advice?;;;Before it was discovered I had ADHD-PI in college (it probably would have been discovered in middle school or high school had it not been for my circumstances) and I had very difficult circumstances that depressed me. struggled getting my assignments done, focusing in class, (couldn't stop zoning out and day dreaming), reading was hell, my working  memory was always bad, and my parents ended up staying till 3am doing my work for me. On top of that my parents used to spend thousands of dollars on tutors to try and help me, and these tutors usually just got really pissed at me because I couldn't follow their directions well, it was hard for me to do things at their pace, or do the stuff they assigned me. Teachers did kind of notice that things didn't match up between the work I "supposedly produced" and the way I was in class and sent home notes to my parents, but my parents always met with them and insisted that the work was mine and told the teachers all these supposedly great things i've done, which were my parents work. Students, however bullied me a lot because they picked up the incosistancies as well. My parents even took me out of regular school and home-schooled me for a few years because of this. I used to think everyone struggled like I did.  In high school I ended up struggling even more having to cheat in ridiculous ways to be able to succeed and it made me feel terrible. I always tried to keep up with the work, focus, memorize, but it never worked out so thats what happened. Of course I got caught a ton, but teachers still let me go because they saw how guilty and bad i felt and they liked my personality. Also, my parents called them. I also ended up spent 4 years at the community college because i was so lost and couldn't balance my schedule, show up on time,turn in assignments and I kept changing my major because everything seemed interesting and then I'd get into classes, struggle with my same focusing issues and have to drop out. Eventually it was discovered what was going on with me and now i'm doing a lot better with treatment, but this is my past. All of those misrepresentations from my parens and facades fell apart.  It  makes me so anxiety-ridden to even discuss it and I grew up very guilty and sad because of this stuff. Sometimes I'm angry at my parents for not noticing or understanding, but they really wanted to help me in the best way they could at the time even though they didn't understand either.  I also feel bad that they had to take on my responsibilities no  matter how hard i tried on my own and it always felt so so wrong and I hated cheating and just going into exams completely lost because I didn't understand anything no matter how hard I tried to study and I really wanted to learn so badly.  My parents also gave me a lot of opportunities growing up that a lot of people don't have and because of who I am I was unable to take utilize them. They wanted me to play the piano, paint, and numerous other things, which I just couldn't do or balance/focus on. I really feel like i grew up letting everybody down because of who I am. It also feels really shitty having to had to struggle so much when now things are way more manageable for me. Right now I'm graduating college and I feel so fucking weird about things like being able to  just make it through a class, balance responsibilities, and even goof around with friends and just make people laugh. I sometimes use my past to push myself harder to achieve these days, but when it isn't troubling me like it is now I try and use it as a way of understanding that there is a lot more to each person and their circumstances than meets the eye and that I want to help people and understand their circumstances as well.  Still my past makes me feel incredibly guilty and bad. I want to do things the way everyone else does even if it's  not fair to me, like last week when I finally talked to a professor because I need extra times on exams I just felt so bad, awkward, and stupid and vulnerable. Does anyone else have a difficult past like this? How could I work on resolving my feelings about it or being at peace with it?   tl;dr: I feel like I had to  live a lie and struggled a ton before it was discovered what was going on with me. Things much are much less difficult now, but my past is just so unsettling so any advice on how to not be so disturbed and hurt about it would be appreciated also similar experiences. It took me forever to write these, but i've held back these thoughts for a while.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;What do you recommend I do? I'm struggling.;;;Just found this sub a few mins ago, but I have been battling this problem for years. I've never done well in school. Always in Trouble, can't focus even when I literally am trying my best,Haven't made honor roll once in my life, and it's not due to my intelligence either. My teachers all tell my parents how intelligent I am, that I should be an easy A student, and don't understand when I look at them in disbelief. I tried talking to my parents about it and they pretty much told me that even if I was diagnosed by a doctor, they wouldn't believe it, and that ADHD is a made up disease.   I'm currently a junior in highschool, and I love computers. I love coding, I love networking, and I want to go to college for network administration. With my current grades, there's no way that's going to happen.   I've taken aderall before. Illegally of course, but it improved my schooling by 100% literally, I was doing so incredibly well, everything was clear and I wasn't getting foggy when I tried to focus. I seriously want to make something out of myself but I struggle so very much. Any tips for me? Sorry for the wall of text.  Tl;dr I think I have ADHD but I can't get checked out because of parents.
d3f669baca39a70a57ee60c418ab287c875e744a6f0f8d40eb515983cc28d0c4;;;Frustration trying to get meds. Any advice?;;;I've been getting the run around now for 3 months. I was diagnosed with ADHD as a teen but never wanted medication. I recently started an MA and it's been giving me a lot of problems so I decided to pursue medication.   Firstly, my doctor wanted a new diagnosis since mine was over 10 years old. That was completely understandable, but now I've been waiting to see her for about 3 weeks and they just cancelled my appointment because she's going on some sort of leave until the end of January.  I know it's not the end of the world; I've been dealing with no medication for years now. It's just gotten to a point where I'm so frustrated with my ADHD that I'm willing to try meds, but being told I have to wait till the end of January.   Have any of you gone through something similar? Got any advice?

Until Jury Duty...;;;For the last... 12 years or so, I've had a lot of freedom to structure my days how I like.  I couldn't remember the last time I'd been bored. My ADHD interfered with housework, but not much else.  I was clearly totally in control....  Until today, when I had jury duty. BLECH.  They put 60 of us in a hot room with 40 seats. I stood, and was the only person constantly rocking back and forth and switching feet. Then, we had to watch a really, really, boring video. But someone fainted, so then we had to watch the whole thing TWICE. IN A ROW. When once was bad enough.  ARGH!!!!!!  Luckily, from where I was standing, I had a view of a window where some workers were doing road construction, or I would have lost my mind.....  Anyway, after 2 hours of cramped and boring, the lawyers reached and agreement and we could leave without having to serve... but...  Sheesh! Apparently the reason I excel at llife is because I can avoid crowded rooms and excessive boring....

I have had debilitating ADHD, and its been ruining my success since I can remember. I have never passed a class until this year and have a long history of getting in fights and saying things i shouldn't. I'm currently seeing a therapist and I'm going to be put on meds in feb. I'm working towards my diploma right now and really have to focus and work or I'll be kicked from the program I'm in. My problem is the only time I get work done is when I buy meds from various sources, which is expensive and dangerous. I NEED a solution for the short term, got any?

Thanks so much for the kind words everyone.  Also to answer a few questions. .the nursing office has a list of my meds so they could have cross referenced.  Also I go to school in the US. U am meeting with my advisor today to discuss what happened and call a meeting with the staff. I will update when that happens.  I'm in nursing school and we have to get random drug screenings. Last week we had a random urinalysis done, we have had this done before and I received a phone call from the screening company telling me that I tested positive for amphetamines and to provide a picture of my medication bottle. This time no one called me so I assumed I was fine. However, today during class our Dean of Students and a director came and announce my name. I raised my hand and I was told to gather all of my things and come with them at once. this was in front of my entire nursing program. I was taken to a separate room and told that I tested positive and the drug screen, and then I was handed a sheet of paper. The paper says I tested positive for amphetamines, I explained that I take medication for ADD. The director then proceeded to tell me that I should have gotten a phone call from the screening company, however when I told her I never received the phone call she gave me the number and then I realize that I had been getting calls from that number but I assumed it was a sales call since whenever I tried to call back all I got was an error message. The good news is I was able to clear everything up, the bad news is I was embarrassed in front of my entire class and when I returned to class everyone assumed that I had tested positive for drugs. I've then had to clear the air with my fellow classmates and explain to them that I take a medication that shows up on a drug screen. I feel like my privacy was violated, &amp; I had to miss an entire day's worth of lectures due to the amount of time it took to process my information at the screening company. I am Not sure this is the correct thread to post this in, but aren't there some sort of regulations that are in place to prevent things like this from happening? Was it necessary that I was pulled out of class in the manner that I was?

Just to preface, I am a 17 years old male, have AD/HD Primarily inattentive, and also have some social anxiety. I am being treated and taking Adderall 20mg.   So the other day my girlfriend and I went to a Wal-mart by my house to buy condoms. Naturally, because of our age, I wanted to keep this on the D-low and not run into anyone we knew. I must have been on autopilot and not have realized what we were actually doing until we were in the isle, if that makes sense. Basically, all of the social anxiety hit me at once. I suddenly felt like I needed to get away from her and into another isle right away.  She understood and we met up at another section. I hurried her through the self checkout and all of this time I just really wanted to leave. We got back into my car and I find it hard to describe how I was feeling. I felt out of it and disconnected but I also felt nauseous and irritated. I really wanted to just be held and comforted. I hadn't eaten in a while so I though with some food I would feel better. I made a sandwich and we went upstairs where I proceeded to bawl my eyes out while she held me.   After around five minutes of this I felt a lot better and just suddenly stopped crying. It was like I had woken up. I've never felt anything like that whole experience before and it was quite confusing and unpleasant. I didn't really experience any of the physical symptoms like heart rate and such.  So my questions are as follows  * Do you think that was a panic attack or was it something else?  * Does the medicine have anything to do with it?  *  Are these a side effect of AD/HD just in general?  Thanks for reading =)  TL;DR- Went to buy condoms, had possible panic attack, or did I?

Though i was absolutely confident i knew the material i just got a B in Trig.. Before you weigh in on how a B is a good grade its important to note that we only had two in class grades which were the midterm and final, this being community college the mid and final were only worth 25% of my grade anyway the rest was all online work i could redo as many times as needed to get an A. I walked into that test supremely confident that i had it but just saw my final exam grade was a 64. I got a 69 on the midterm and a 64 on the final. My B is absolutely fake i don't deserve that its artificially propped up by an insane grading scale..  I'm an engineering major and have a ton more math to do. This was my first semester medicated and while i for sure slacked off i always managed to buckle down at the last second and get the work done i needed to get done. I thought i had a handle on this stuff, i really thought i was walking into a formality to get that A but looking at my grades now i see im a complete fraud and should be at a C or D at best... There isn't really a point to this i just needed to get this off my chest and could never open up about it to the people in my life, their belief in me keeps me going and i have to protect that no matter what..  TL;DR: Got a B in a college trig course i don't deserve, thought i had the material down but received a 69 and 64 on my midterm and final respectively. Feeling really deflated that even though i FEEL like i am getting the material now its all a lie. I failed out of college the first time due to my ADHD and failure to commit to work and even though i'm medicated and focused its not enough.

I got diagnosed this semester with ADHD NOS and with the help of therapy and Ritalin I've been working pretty fucking hard to do the best I can.   But I feel empty. Whenever I finished an exam or an assignment i know I did well in I didn't feel accomplished. I just felt like I got something done. I remember after one exam I went home and broke down crying. My parents asked if I had failed it but I didn't. I did really well actually.   I had made so much progress this semester but now I feel like I'm regressing. Could it be the medication that's robbing me from feeling proud of myself?
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;life check in i guess;;;Hello friends so my semester has ended and i got my grades and it has been a really crazy semester. I have lived with ADHD for pretty much all my life and been on medications for basically as long as i can remember. So i had some issues with medication this semester where it seemed to no longer be working. this resulted in at midterms i was failing every class and before this i was a 3.65 GPA so really not the norm for me. so i got it checked out and my dosage changed. i finished the semester with nothing lower than a B- in an class, the courses where heat transfer, signals and systems, motors and controls, dynamical systems and chaos. so that is rather fantastic. so yay me. it was a really mind opening experience kinda crazy, i have no idea how to describe it, almost like thinking i was me until i fixed it and then i was me and i wasn't before. really trippy.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Yeah... I have no idea what goes on in my life. It's probably not ADHD, but perhaps you guys can help.;;;I don't have ADHD. A lot of times I think that doing the whole WebMD/paranoid-self-diagnosis/half-sarcastic-I-have-this-disorder-because-this-one-time-didn't-focus things are offensive to people who actually struggle with something this tough. That being said, I took a course in Special Education this semester, and, of course, I began self-diagnosing myself with all the different exceptionalities we were learning about.  Obviously, I don't have them, but the one that stuck out was ADHD spectrum things. I demonstrate a lot of the inability-to-focus things, but don't have the constantly-thinking-about-useless-stuff brain or hyperactivity. I feel a lot of my problems come from being in a gifted program ALL throughout public school and not learning a lot of studying and learning techniques that most kids did. I'm decently smart, but that can't carry me the whole way.  To top it off, I'm SO goddamn lazy. For you guys here, I understand you aren't lazy. But my question to you, and hopefully you can help, is how do you convince yourself to do things NOW? I understand all the little working/staying on task techniques but it doesn't do any good if I never DO anything important. I hate myself a lot sometimes especially when I see my little brother, who despite all the pride I have in him for how awesome he is, I feel a lot of jealousy for how good he is at DOING things.   tl;dr, How do you focus in on doing things in the NOW?  p.s. I apologize for this post, I feel I just got kinda ranty and needed to say something somewhere.

While in high school I was diagnosed with Depression and ADHD. I was given Ritalin for ADHD and Prozac (later switched to Paxil) for depression. I noticed I was getting addicted to one of the pills. I don't recall which, but I started loving the hour or so "high" it gave me. I think it had some sort of amphetamine or similar in it. I was able to pay attention to everything that was happening without my mind wandering and was actually interested in what was being talked about for the hour duration. Once I recognized that I was becoming addicted I completely stopped taking all pills and stopped going to the doctor all together. It has been a long time. I have been able to make tremendous strides fighting depression on my own (which I do not recommend or suggest. It was a long struggle). I have not been able to overcome in any way shape or form my ADHD. I am thinking about going back to the doctor to talk to them about my options, but I am scared. I think I'm just here for support before I go back to the doctor.    uh...I just want to say I am scared again.   Thanks for whatever you say.

And what are the other options for ADD other than vyvanse?;;;First of all, I was diagnosed with ADD few weeks ago when I was doing the usual physical exam with blood tests. I told the doctor about my symptoms and he kept asking me different questions until he told me at the end that I had ADD and prescribed a 40mg vyvanse.  I wasn't sure about, so I took few days looking for ADD through internet and checking the symptoms again. Then I started taking my pills. It makes me awake for more than 30hours and I have sharp fully functioned brain at the time I am taking it.   My concern here that the pills might affect me in the long run and I am looking for alternative options other than those pills. Also should I ask another professional doctor? What doctor should I go to ?   Thanks

There aren't many people I can discuss it with because it makes me seem like a terrible person.  I get interested in someone. I begin to like them. They like me back. We begin dating and I'm really into them at first and then all of a sudden I'm bored.  This is happening with my current boyfriend. We've been dating a couple of months now. He's really sweet and I was really into him at first. There's nothing at all wrong with him. We share interests, he's actually a really interesting person, and we enjoy our time together. It's just that now I'm *bored* and disinterested. Simply having a text conversation feels like a chore. I'd rather stay home and watch Netflix or hang out with friends than spend time with him. He's head-over-heels for me and keeps telling me that I'm the greatest girl he's ever met, how amazing I am, how glad he is that he found me, etc.  ...And I'm finding myself hoping that he does decide to go through with going to a grad school he's been looking at that's in another country so that we can break things off naturally. I don't have a real reason to break up with him, but I don't want to spend years with him.  I'm never sure whether to end it because it's hard to explain to someone that you meant everything you said and you weren't trying to lead them on and not hurt their feelings. I know I'll do some serious emotional damage to my current boyfriend if I end it now when things seem to be going great, but it's also a bad idea to let him get more invested if it won't work out when he could be finding someone who'd want to spend the rest of their life with him.  I hadn't dated anyone since my ex girlfriend last year, and kind of stuck to casual sex until now. I knew I might end up feeling like this because this isn't anywhere close to the first time someone has been really into me and I stop being interested, but I was hoping that I would have grown out of it.   Has anyone else had this issue? If so, have you ever been in a long term relationship in which you stayed interested, i.e. is there hope for me?   **TL;DR:** Whenever I date someone I'm really interested in them at first but lose interest after they're already really into me.
c41abb1db0712a4401f9a506ac4154b529accb47b0dbbfdd9865f807beb9d6e3;;;I'm a 16 year old with recently diagnosed ADHD (predominantly inattentive) and a I need some mental guidance/an opportunity to vent and sympathize.;;;Hello denizens of /r/adhd!  A few months ago, I was diagnosed with ADHD (predominantly inattentive type) by my psychologist. It was a long and frustrating journey and so far it continues to be, and I'm looking for some guidance from the wise redditors at /r/adhd. But I guess now would be a good time for some background information  I had never had any true ADHD symptoms as a young child, and it wasn't until I was in the 7th or 8th grade that I began to notice a change; ie:  * a drop in grades * dramatic decrease in my ability to focus * overall disinterest in school or other menial tasks and things I wasn't necessarily interested in  At first, my parents and I both attributed this to growing physically and undergoing normal hormonal changes that effected my mentality.  By freshman year, my inability to focus had grown worse, and my grades kept slipping. I realized there was something abnormal occurring in my brain. I had seemingly lost my ability to hold my emotions, and i couldn't maintain the feelings I would have for the girls I'd have crushes on, I couldn't keep my mind from drifting during class or an important lecture, and most frustrating of all, I wasn't able to concentrate or focus long enough to be able to express myself creatively through music or art, something incredibly crucial to my personality. All these issues lead me into a pretty dark spout of depression, and I didn't know what to do. Eventually, I gathered myself up enough to visit my school psychologist, and she tested me for a variety of mental disorders. Her results concluded that I had depression, a generalized anxiety disorder, and ADHD.   Skip forward a few months and several therapy sessions and a formal diagnosis of ADHD from my independent psych, and I found myself with a prescription of 20mg Vyvanse. This prescription raised a lot of questions with my family, with my mother maintaining the opinion that I didn't really need the meds and that I just wasn't trying hard enough. This view about my current state from my mom was pretty crippling, and I continued to dip into depression. There where a lot of underlying emotional issues going on inside my head at this time, but I'll spare you guys that info and save it for my shrink in order to shorten this story.   But now, what I had been waiting months and months of frustration for was finally obtained. I had a prescription, a panacea, a cure-all, I would be able to focus! And write music again!  And with great excitement I took my first Vyvanse...  And nothing happened. And then i took them for the week, and still nothing. Then I started taking 30mg, for a whole month andddd **nothing**. This was a horrifying realization, and I think a valuable lesson to be told to other people beginning with their first ADHD meds, because whatever expectations I had, were not met.  So my doctor switched me to Metadate CD, claiming that I just may not be effected by amphetamine based meds. This angered me, because I believed that just increasing my dosage would begin to work, but now i would have to start over with a tiny 10mg.   And this is practically where I am now. I took 10mg everyday for the first week, and I noticed a slight difference, and now I take 20mg every day and it's increased a bit more. But I'm still very frustrated by this process. This is not what I expected, but I'm not sure what I was expecting to begin with. I guess the biggest question I could ask my fellow redditors is: **What is normal supposed to feel like?** I'm not sure what I'm looking for these medications to do or how they should make me feel. I need /r/adhd's help because you guys know what it feels like and how treatment should work because you all share this disorder, unlike my doctor. I guess thats where I have to start.   Thanks for reading this and hopefully you have something to say that could help me get through this shitty situation! If you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them. Thanks guys!

I was never diagnosed but there is surely something very wrong with my attention. If i try to follow the same amount of things as normal people, my brain overheats and it goes into blank state where i cant even understand whan everyone is telling me. I do not know the meaning of sounds they are making with their mouths, i do not know what the hell am i suppose to be doing right know and i would screw up even making a sandwich. If i keep numer of things i need to take care of at once to a minimum i manage, but i started to think i should get some help, becouse i cant even ride a bike without risk of forgetting that im riding it and crashing into wall. If i was to seek medical help, what are side effects of drugs that help with that? I may be very misinformed, but i am afraid of looking like meth addict in 15 years. How do you feel after long time of taking meds? Thanks.  TL;DR: will i look like jagger after 15 years of taking meds

We spent the session talking about how anxiety could have prevented me from sticking to a job. He decided it would be best to put me on 10mg lexapro to manage what he believed was anxiety and not so much ADHD, that causing the change in professions.   Has anyone else experienced multiple job changes in different fields, is this common in ADHD or is it more linked to anxiety ?

One of the biggest things I struggle with is an internal struggle where I'm trying to define Which of my wrongdoings are the adhd and which are just me. It is always in the back of my head when doing homework or something else and I lose track and just end up not doing things, It is always itching at the back of my head that is just my fault in the end. That the adhd does not really contribute. Sadly, I've gone without any medication(lack of insurance) for a few years now and have struggled with failing grades(got expelled this semester for low GPA) and impulsive behavior(has ended several friendships, and has gotten me fired before).  Recently aplyed for medical so hopefully I can get my medication. But do you guys struggle with the same (what is and is not my fault) mental debates?

Since I can remember, I have been having problems paying attention, fighting, a good amount of stuff. Recently(15) I went to a neurologist and got diagnosed with ADHD and Anxiety. I also have been diagnosed with the iron deficiency anemia. I have every symptom. I believe I am also depressed. Never diagnosed because I would never admit to suicidal thoughts or any of that. I'm the person who just keeps everything inside and doesn't like talking to therapists.  Everything above is untreated. No medication, no visits, no treatment whatsoever. I feel like I need treatment though. It's not really that I'm depressed, it's more I'm annoyed to the point where I want to kill myself. I would say I'm not afraid to die. A symptom that annoys me the most is the lack of attention in class. I can be taking notes, and then just zone out and miss a section. I also get extreme shivers from anxiety. It's usually in public when I'm not anxious at all. Like waiting on the bus for school. I'm not cold, but it's just so annoying.   Well, I'm just looking for some advice. I'm expecting go talk to your parents, etc. Just some input to help me. Sorry for the grammar or rambling, I guess I zoned out during English class.

Since then i did about a year on straterra, 2 years on concerta, 4 years off meds and now im back on concerta, 36mg. I've been fighting with something that i thought was part of my ADHD and was brought out by stress (i recently changed jobs and took on a LOT more responsibility). I'm starting to wonder (simply from observing when it is i feel it) if it isn't a side effect of my medication.  It's hard to explain, but it feels like my mind is just noisy. I function betteron my meds, so it isn't necessarily detrimental (and i wonder if it's always there and i only notice it when im on my meds), but it sure is distracting as hell. The best i can explain it is its like im standing in a room, right at the center. In front of me is the person/task i am working on. I have 100% focus on it, i'm not distracted from it, it's perfectly clear and normal. The room in front of me is entirely empty, except for this one thing. I assume this is what people with working brains feel like. But the other half of the room, the half that is behind me, is full of people, animals, video games, cell phones, tv shows. And i can feel the weight of all of it pressing up against the back of my mind. Again, it doesn't distract me from my task, though i do notice it, im aware of it at all times.  Physically it feels like theres something between my skull and brain and its absolutely buzzing with energy, looking for an outlet. Its like my meds take all of my ADHD and kick it out of my brain, but not out of my head.  Ok, so thats me trying to describe a mental ailment and maybe 3 of you grasp what i'm trying to say. I just wondered if this was something else other people with our particular gift dealt with.

I am 19,  male, &amp; I have ADHD &amp; APD (Anti-social personal disorder). I've only recently started medication,  started Stratera around Oct 2013 stopped taking it because the side effects were too strong  then In Nov 2013 I switched to Adderall. which for me even though it is an abused drug. It works for me, it helps my attitude, focusing, thought possess, and the best thing for me that it helps with is that I dont over think anything anymore! Such a relief to not think about the same thing that causes stress, anger, and anxiety for hours and hours! I also am pro-marijuana, in my mind I truly feel like it helps my ADHD. For me its not just getting high because I wanna get weird. No for me its a release from the sick twisted fucked up world my mind has created, escape from judgment, and its helped me figure out who the fuck I really am, also giving me an idea of who I wanna be in the years to come.   growing up w/ ADHD. School was hard, I had friends, not many but I had them. I had a few close friends. I wasn't popular but I also wasn't not popular, I was norm. I was probably known for being a rude asshole, I wasn't a nice person in school, really I was a verbally abusive douche! From elementary to high school! I also definitely had ego issues!  Now outside of school I see and constantly look back at how shitty of a person I was, knowing I can't fix that shit! But know I can do good.  The APD I think I've always had mildly, where I'd periodically not talk to anyone for days or even up to a month at a time until my senior yr where it got to its worst, &amp; I surprisingly graduated.  I missed 44 days of school the first semester, 39 last semester just cause I didn't wanna be around ppl, I felt weird in a way. Also I got kicked off the swim team a month in to the season, but the thing that affected me the most was  a friend/relationship I was in from june-Feb. We hung out every day, we were together so much at one point I thought I was in love, now I know I'm not. The reason I "loved" her was because she was different. I defiantly have relationship problems, I wig my self out about trusting women. So to find her was a miracle at the time! But I've never had trouble talking to girls, I have trouble getting to know girls, and trusting them, most girls I do talk to I usually mess around with them for a couple weeks then move on just cause I dont see anything in them away from sexual things, so I end it before they get hurt even though they do get hurt.  But at the same time of all the shitty things, ADHD has showed me great things too! Like how capable my mind is, how I differ from others, that I'm unique and will always be me!

However, I am having trouble with administration courses ( management, human resources, marketing etc...)  There is one class which **I dropped 3 times** because I just couldn't get myself to read past the first 2 pages of the book. I tried hundreds of times but I was struggling to understand what I was reading, **it felt like there is a hole in my head through which words just escaped before I could register them**.   **Today I was determined to finish the first chapter once and for all**. All previous and different approaches failed so **I just took 2 pills** and and 30 minutes later something weird happened   * **Peace!** * My internal monologue stopped  * Everything was so calm * I got up, got my book and actually read the first page and I actually enjoyed it! * I enjoyed it! * 3 hours later, I finished the first chapter( 27 pages, not much, i know,  but it is a giant leap for me)   * I was also able to summarize, as I was reading, key points which will help me to study for the final  * I am feeling great and I can't wait to finish the 2nd chapter!!   **Tip: I did the summary by following this technique**  * 1) You ask a question ( usually you will find it in the course's objective which is generally divided into weeks or classes).   * 2) You answer the question by adding definitions, arguments, examples etc..  * 3) You summarize the answer in a way that will make it easier to put you in context in order to remember all the above key points.   **Doing this is important because what is the point of reading everything if you can't remember anything.**   This is the summary: http://imgur.com/0NEOSrm

I'm talking grades that are average at best, putting kitchen utensils in the microwave, getting half-way to the bus stop before realising I've forgotten my school bag, etc.   What I should also mention is that understanding and support for ADHD is *at least* limited in Bulgaria. I'm pretty sure Adderall, Ritalin, Concerta, and the like are not distributed here.   My family is completely sure I'm just a lazy and rebellious teenage boy who doesn't know what's good for him. I don't want them to know anything unless I get diagnosed *and* am offered a satisfactory treatment method.  I'm a bit scared, because I don't know how the whole process works(internet searches for ADHD in Bulgarian lead me to people looking to buy Adderall from abroad and the wikipedia article on it). I guess I should go to my GP and talk to her about it, but from then on I'm clueless.   So enlighten me, what must I do? And please keep in mind, I'm not trying to get high *nor* have I diagnosed myself. I know very well that any kind of self-diagnosis is inappropriate and inadvisable.

I won't bore you with a list of ADD symptoms but over many years I have come to realize that I fit the primarily-inattentive description to a tee. I pursued this some in high school but my parents were very unresponsive primarily because I get good grades for the most part, am very smart/articulate, and they are generally dismissive of psychiatry. I have pursued my school's counseling services, which helps a little, even got a prescription for Wellbutrin (I didn't want to go on an SSRI, but it helps very little), but I don't think they can get me a real diagnosis or counseling/medication for ADHD (as far as I know they give out primarily prescriptions for antidepressants as those are less problematic to be giving out to college students). I have concurrent anxious and depressive symptoms in addition to my motivation/focus deficits (why I got the Wellbutrin scrip). I have this strong feeling of impending doom- every time i need to muster any kind of focus or motivation I fail, and I have basically crossed everything else off the list (by which I mean diet, exercise, meditation, counseling, etc.). One of these days I won't be able to get by on sheer intelligence alone and I just don't know what I'll do.   edit: I forgot to mention that in the past when I have had truly large tasks that required extensive focus (besides tests-which I am very good at), I have always had some sort of crutch, generally my mother, my peers, or clandestinely obtained ADHD meds.

acf970e65ce769cba392b880a7b05411b28f0bd62d1db63de8fb1eb5b9cd8b19;;;Brief introduction and question about motivation issues beyond ADHD (or maybe wrong prescription?);;;TL;DR Hi! Recently got on Adderall, seeing improvements, just not where I want to see them. Halp!   I was diagnosed with ADD as a child, nearing thirty years ago. I took Ritalin from 2nd grade until 6th grade when my dad decided on his own I'd "been on it long enough", even though by all accounts it was having its intended effect. Fast forward to recently, my wife bugged me for a year about getting rechecked. I did, still have it (of course). My doctor put me on Adderall XR 20mg.  Now I'm nearing the end of my first month on it. The adverse side effects are beginning to fade away (slight "lockjaw" feeling, headache, occasional mild euphoria, dry mouth and eyes, spacing out mid-sentence because the next word vanished from my brain suddenly).   As far as primary symptoms my wife used to complain about, they're definitely better. I don't struggle with the motivation to do simple daily chores like I used to. I'm showering more, cleaning the house and dishes. Simple stuff "normal" people take for granted. I'm going to the gym, getting plenty of exercise. I'm getting better at reading without having to go back and re-read or fight off the loud internal monolog telling me there's much more interesting things to do. My on the job training is improving (monitor and controlling processes that may take 30 minutes or more to react to changes, easy to get distracted and miss small yet pertinent changes).   So, improvements! Yay! (Exited muppet dance!)   Problem for me is that these improvements, while necessary for maintaining job, health, and personal relationships, none of these improvements are carrying over into those "quality of life" activities that keep me getting up in the morning and doing the basic life stuff. I'm a musician, got a band, side project, lots of ideas for other musical stuff. I've invested countless hours in group practices and performances, thousands of dollars into a wide assortment of gear. I have a basic home studio and all the accouterments needed to record whole songs all by myself. But I don't. I *love* playing with other people. But I hardly ever practice alone. And I never just play alone for enjoyment. I acknowledge the necessity of doing so to become a better musician. Indeed, I have a gig in a week which I'm not fully prepared for. But even knowing this doesn't translate into the motivation to just sit down and practice on my own. It's beginning to develop into a sort of personal crisis. I *should not* have this kind of trouble pursuing what should be at best a joyous process or at worst just tedious technical noodling. This same issue affects other quality of life activities... Can't do yoga outside of a class.   For years now I've mostly just avoided the frustration that these problems induce by just ignoring them completely. But now that I'm being treated for ADHD again the frustration is back. I don't know if I'm expecting too much of my Adderall, or if I need a different prescription, or some kind of counseling, or what. Maybe I'm just being impatient and the Adderall will begin to improve these areas eventually. All I know is these invisible chains holding me back are oppressive and extremely frustrating. I want to be rid of them and see how far I take my life's passions unfettered by this affliction.   Thanks for reading this far. Sorry I'm I'm too verbose.

I need help with how to deal with them.;;;I live with my sister and her husband (my brother-in-law) and although I haven't been diagnosed with ADHD by a doctor, I've done a lot of research and I've come to believe that I may have it. When I brought up the subject to my sister she immediately said "You don't have ADHD" and before I could say anything my brother-in-law said that he wouldn't go to a psychiatrist to get me checked either way. I can't go by myself because I am 16. I have trouble focusing and I'm falling behind in my classes. Reading used to be one of my favorite activities, but now it seems like it requires too much thinking and I really hate not being able to do anything without going off on a tangent. I just need to know what I can do to talk to them without making them feel attacked.

When I try to talk to a doctor I tend to get off focus onto what they are trying to say and can't actually listen to everything they are saying. I seem to only catch half. Anyways, my point is that it's hard to get anyone to actually see this as a problem. I'm completely frustrated. I relate to everything said here. My other diagnoses are just weighing down this one which IS the problem. My other meds are "working". I am not depressed, blah blah. I don't even know how to explain. I'm on a nice coctail of medications for different things. Throughout college, I was on all of the same meds except instead of 60 of vyvanse I was on 60 of adderall. Many doctors over look the significance of the adhd since my stupid bipolar diagnosis which my therapist doesn't believe, my old psychiatrist thought most of my problems (moodiness) were from my mother. Yada yada, it probably shouldn't even be there is the sum of it all. But it's one of those "once it is on there it's next to impossible to take off"     I've been diagnosed with ADHD and been on meds for that since I was 14. Since the bipolar diagnosis they have taken me off and then slowly put me back on and now that I've moved and I'm seeing a new psychiatrist, well it's like starting over.     I have no motivation, I can't seem to finish anything. I can barely finish a thought when I attempt to look back and read this. My functioning is down to almost nothing. I was able to finish school (with medication). They see my dose as "too high" (which it is kinda high but my tolerance is really high too).     My current doctor literally spent 10 minutes getting my history. I feel like I'm going doctor shopping and all they're going to look at is "is she trying to just get some controlled substances" WHICH I'M NOT!!! I'm trying to function. I'm trying to actually write a cover letter without getting distracted by real estate or something else. I am trying to get a job but I get distracted from job to job. I'm beyond frustrated. Without like 15 cups of coffee my motivation to actually try to get a job simply doesn't exist.     Even if I got a job, my ability to listen is sub-par. I was working for 3 weeks and ugh, it took me forever to learn. I hate saying "what" all the time or asking the same question over and over again. Well, my boss seems to hate that. I don't catch on quickly the way I used to. I'm like in space. I'm all over the place.  I'm beyond frustrated. If anyone is in the NYC area and has any suggestions on a psychiatrist that will actually listen, please let me know. I don't know what to do anymore. I haven't gotten anywhere in life since I've been off meds. I've gone from one thing to the next to the next without being able to stay on task or finish anything. I'm shocked I was able to finish school at this point; I always wanted to go to grad school but taking the LSATS in June seems impossible right now without the 15 cups of coffee a day. And even with the coffee, I'm still not the way I used to be when I was on the 60 of adderall. It's hard for me to think that I was actually able to function.     Maybe printing this out to a psychiatrist would help. I don't know what to do!!! I called a specialist in the NYC area who isn't taking patients. Doing research on finding a doctor is a daunting task that I keep getting distracted from based on other stuff on the internet/looking for coops/trying to write a cover letter/trying to find any job and actually focus on trying to find the job/having the motivation. My brain is all over the place. I feel like I'm just getting dumber.   Sorry for all of this venting. If anyone has had the patience to read any of this, any advice is appreciated.     TL;DR have other diagnoses,  moved to a new area, seeing a new psychiatrist, frustrated, anyone know a good psychiatrist in the nyc area that knows/specializes in adhd?
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Questions about best ADHD meds that also works w Depression?;;;Ok so I am a 30 F w ADHD (diagnosed) and I have been off Meds since I graduated college 8 years ago.  It's been rough but almost managable. The thing is I have also been battling with depression for say three-ish years, and have been in a massive rut for a long time in a lot of areas in my life.  I am well aware that I want to tackle this and get out of the rut and am aware that a lot of the changes i have in mind are goign to cause a lot of emotional and psychologiacal fallout.    I have been considering getting my self back on the medication as the suppliments I've been using (St Johns Wort and Vitamin D for the depression, and b12 for the focus... and about 2-3 cups of coffee) are not always sufficient during times of increased stress and anxiety. And now that I have health insurance again it may be beneficial to persue this. So for those who have been adapting to both depression and ADHD, what medications have you tried? Which ones were most and least effective? Why?

I think now for 1 or 2 years something weird has happened. I lost my ability to be think stuff out in detail like when I have an idea for a design I try to focus on it but it is like a battle with Mr. poof gone and Mr. KEEP THE IDEA. But I can't.   Now to the problem,  my thought is literately numb. I think about nothing. I have no thought. I can only think when I force myself to it. I have no idea what is going on...  I am feeling like a mindless zombie.  Also I have this a lot: a Mental Block, Anyone has any experience with it? Everytime I try to do something I get some sort of mental block. something that just weirdly blocks me from doing it until I force myself to it. I have this in school and in normal life. I do not know how to explain it, it is quite weird.  I don't know if I should mention this but in the last 1 or 2 years I have became calmer and calmer. Like I do not walk that fast anymore, I do not think about everything and everything anymore. Oh and I can keep my head at the conversation. (sort of) at least better then i could normally.  not that I do not want that but at the cost of being a mindless zombie I rather be much more happy and jumpy like I used to. Well actually I do not want that. I rather be a happy jumpy tom then a chill moody annoyed Tom.  Does anyone recognize anything in my story or knows a solution?  Thanks!  Tom  EDIT: I take no meds but I must have tried almost everything. I stopped 2 years ago... (but that can't be it right, as far as I am concerned meds do that... right?)
f02f4b0fe999bfb6453967e10527944da66862a991898f915166c24f6066a062;;;I made a personal change to a seemingly pointless prescription update. Is this my fault or theirs..? (Super long, sorry in advance);;;I'm sorry in advance for this post being all over the place, I'm just not sure what the issue is here.  Last November I finally decided to act on what I suspected to be ADHD after 19 years of assuming everyone struggled like this. I went to the open clinic that Henry Ford holds in some offices, and met with a doctor who had a hard enough time speaking English, and apparently a harder time properly diagnosing patients.  She gave me 30 days worth of 10mg Adderall, after a few very basic questions. I've been reading that most stimulants warrant an EKG test beforehand, which she definitely did not do. She said if 10mg didn't seem to do the trick to call her and then start taking two 10mg tablets, twice daily.  After about a week and a half of 20mg twice daily I had gotten frustrated enough with no signs of improvement to call back and continue looking for a solution. You all don't need to hear about how hard it was to contact her, but I ended up explaining everything that had happened so far to one of her colleagues. Ultimately, I made it pretty clear that 20mg was not accomplishing what I had hoped. Instead of increasing the dosage or changing the med entirely, she prescribed 20mg (not 10mg x 2), to be taken twice daily. Essentially the exact same thing that I had been taking.  Obviously this seemed pointless and she confirmed that they were identical dosages over the phone, and she clearly did not understand my problem. Since I got the script filled I've been taking 40mg (20mg x 2) twice daily. It's been working wonders, with the usual side effects everyone else seems to be showing. Now that my schedule is different and I think XR would work better for me than the IR I've been using, the doctors from the clinic are appalled that I've been taking 40mg and say that it will be very difficult to switch to XR.  I know this was a lot but I'm just confused. Was it wrong of me to take 40mg instead because of the pointless "new" script? I'm not even sure what my actual question is, I just want confirmation that I haven't destroyed my body or something by doing this. And maybe advice in general I suppose.   tl;dr: No results after 2x10mg twice daily. Dr prescribed one 20mg twice daily, but I've been taking 2x20mg twice a day. Bad or not..?
28ad2a06928d72de7c89c3506480d97cc842dd752b174588d7b47ee6ba7135c7;;;Looking for advice to help brother [27] cope with ADHD, or point him in right direction.;;;I searched the faq and other posts before posting, so here goes.   My brother was diagnosed maybe around age 10 with ADHD. He took medication for it up until some point in high school (Adderal, I believe) but it kept him up at night and he stopped taking it. Since graduating high school, his life has been a downward spiral. What few friends he still has left from those days have grown up, and have families of their own, went to college, etc., and my brother has been working pt jobs, playing video games to the point of a full blown obsession, and smoking a lot of pot while living at my parents house. I know the Rules say not to mention drug use, but I've read that substance abuse is fairly common with ADHD, and I think it's important to mention. He also doesn't have the best personal hygiene.  He seems depressed, very introverted, and is very defensive to ANY kind positive suggestions on how to better himself. He's extremely forgetful, lazy, an although he expresses a desire to better himself, it's like he mentally can't figure out how to do it  My question is how can I, or my family help my brother realize that he needs help controlling his ADHD so he can have a better life. It breaks my heart to see him not mentally be able to better himself. At the same time, this is a very fragile subject to him, just trying to bring it up will cause a blow out, as he has a very 'know it all' behavior towards this subject.
f7a1f66459a89b42f9193cfb5e8d1b581613badf4314b1906f1f44947e0415d5;;;ADHD;;;A little about me. I am School Psychology PhD student in an APA accredited program. I love educating people about stuff related to field. I also have ADHD, and recently wrote a big ole nasty paper on ADHD that I used for a qualifying exam (which I passed).   tl;dr I have read about 100 peer reviewed papers/books on ADHD and everything I say is backed up with scientific peer reviewed literature.    **You should always be critical of "experts" taking about ADHD.**  * Often, journalists and other various people who claim to be ADHD “experts” trivialize ADHD with their latest “theories” and “causes,” **most of which have no understanding of the scientific findings of ADHD**.   * **Many of these "experts" are just grabbing for attention at some media outlet**.   * The problem I have with this stuff is that it does a disservice to those of us with the disorder, making it hard for us to get through all the bullshit and see what ADHD really is.  **What is ADHD?**  * **ADHD is characterized by developmentally discordant hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattention across multiple settings (DSM-5)**.   * **School is just one area where ADHD is noticeable.** But people with ADHD are obviously different than their same-age peers at church, scouts, recess, birthday parties, and during TV time.   *  **I cannot emphasize this enough** behavior in settings that are difficult for normal children and people, those with ADHD are markedly impaired/worse. It doesn' just happen in schools.   * **There are three flavors of ADHD**: inattentive, hyperactive/impulsive, and combined type.   **Conceptual framework of ADHD**  Evidence suggests that the primary disability associated with ADHD is with behavioral inhibition.  * The core symptoms: hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattention are influenced by a deficit in executive functioning (See Barkley, 1997). **Barkley’s theory states that Executive functions support many cognitive processes and these deficits lead to a reduced ability inhibit behavior.** Barkley has been cited over 5000 times in peer-reviewed journals, the evidence suggests that his theory is valid and it allows for some solid predictions about ADHD. Put simply, Barkleys theory really explains ADHD.  * **Deficits in these areas of executive functioning make it difficult for students with ADHD to inhibit task-irrelevant responses, execute goal-directed responses, sustain persistence in pursuit of a goal, re-engage after distractions and control behavior from what one has learned previously (Barkley, 1997).**   * **These difficulties may manifest as less time on task compared to peers, disruptive classroom behavior, poor persistence on academic tasks, greater distractibility, and inattentiveness in classroom settings (DuPaul &amp; Stoner, 2004; Barkley, 2006).**  **What causes ADHD?**  * Everything points to the **frontal areas of the brain**.   * Which is why people with ADHD 100 years ago were called **minimally brain damaged,** because we acted a lot like people who have had a brain injury, except there was no obvious traumatic event as a cause. Think of Phineas Gage, the poster child of frontal lobe injury.  * The fMRI, MRI, CT scans, EEGs, studies all show that people with ADHD have different frontal lobe functioning than those without ADHD. *  **Metabolites in urine hint that we produce fewer dopamine and norepinephrine**. We just make less dopamine than those without ADHD * **ADHD is a lot like diabetes**, we don’t make enough of something. This is why stimulants are such an effective treatment.  **What makes the frontal lobe shitty?**  * **ADHD is highly genetic**, twin studies and adoptive studies have proved this. For example height heritability is like .80-.91 whereas ADHD is .75 to .97 and averaging about .78.   * **Non-shared and shared environmental factors are astonishingly low compare to the power of genetics with ADHD, accounting for less than 10% of the relationship**.   * **School, bad parenting, or any other fault of society does not meaningfully cause ADHD.**  **ADHD Is caused by shitty genes, that lead to an underproduction of neurotransmitters, which cause executive functioning deficits and trouble delaying prepotent responses.**  * **TLDR; Its not your fault if you have ADHD. You are not lazy. You are not stupid.**

9689ad1c63b4fcb96b01f8d8efa5ff70cd16935b4cbde8b605f5e1b205bdb785;;;Could very low testosterone levels cause a false diagnosis of ADHD?;;;I'm a male in my early 30's and I was recently diagnosed with ADHD-C. To rule out thyroid issues and ensure I didn't have any underlying heart problems, I went to my primary care doctor for a checkup. The results were unexpected: everything fine, except for an very low testosterone level. It was about 190, which I believe puts me in about the bottom 1 or 2% for my age. (For reference, the average level for someone in their 60's is about twice that.)  So my question is: Could low testosterone levels explain a diagnosis of ADHD? I see on WebMD that it could cause poor concentration, so could it also explain inattention, distractability, fidgeting, etc?   By the way, my doctor says "no, but it could make the ADHD seem worse." What do you all think?

Share it with the rest of this community! :);;;  ##### WIN WEDNESDAY!!!  * I started Win Wednesday a long long time ago (anything over 1 year = long long time ago on ADHD time….or that could be recently...but I digress), after noticing most our support group attendees could not think of a positive win they had in the past MONTH. This surprised me and made me realize the importance of thinking about the positive things we have done (no matter how small) on a regular basis.*  **We win every single day. I challenge you to keep track of your wins this week (not just in your mind...write them down) and see if you feel better looking at the list later in the week. Don’t worry if you miss a day or two or three! Do what you can. Even writing them down one day is a win!!!**  -computerpsych  #####Science behind Win Wednesday * Scientists think our brain has a built in negativity bias by reacting more to a negative stimulus. In effect, our brain is like velcro for negative experiences and teflon for positive ones.   * Painful experiences are usually more memorable than positive ones and lasting, good relationships typically need at least a 5:1 ratio of positive to negative interactions.  * By **tilting toward the good** you are leveling the playing field.    * **Instead of positive experiences washing through you like water through a sieve, they’ll collect in the implicit memory deep down in your brain.**  * **Soak in the positive events in your life**   * By pausing and holding that positive feeling for a BIT longer, you are slowly changing the wiring of your brain.   * Much of this information comes from *The Buddha’s Brain* by Rick Hanson. Here is a PDF of his [*Positive Emotions and Taking In the Good*](http://www.rickhanson.net/wp-content/files/PositiveEmotions.pdf).  You can find more at *[rickhanson.net](http://www.rickhanson.net)*  *** Win Wednesday is a chance to focus on our accomplishments for the week. Doing this enough WILL change your brain for the better!  ###***The Sacred Creed of Win Wednesday:***  * **Each and every one of us have victories every week, be they great or small. But in Win Wednesday, *no* victory is truly a small one.**  * **Whatever "level" you happen to be at, progress is *always* a cause for celebration!**   * **Please don’t discount anything you have done. The whole point is to share how YOU won, and did not let your ADHD win!** Check out the examples to see what we mean!**  *** * The point of Win Wednesday is equally **to share our wins AND celebrate the wins of others!** If you do or don’t have a win, feel free to give positive support and cheer to those posting (not just upvoting)!  * **Each week Win Wednesday gets hundreds of views, but only 5 people replying to the winning comments...let’s change things this week!** Just saying “good job” means a lot to someone who has been struggling!  *** ##### PHENOMENAL EXAMPLES FROM PAST WEEKS:  * Started reviewing for a stats test early...beat the curve...and no longer playing catch up in math class for the first time in college (PhD student). * Went to psychiatrist, started medication, feel more ‘normal’ * Wrote an essay and DIDN’T procrastinate until the last minute (not sure if I ever did this) * Went to doctor and is one step closer to ADHD diagnosis. Waiting for psych to call back. * I can change. I can learn to have goals. I can learn to have self control, and manage my time, and connect to people. I can escape the law of entropy.  ##### We love you, /r/adhd! BE PROUD and celebrate with each other! -- *your community managers.*  #####

I new semester is underway and after another student begged me for my ADD meds I felt the need to remind everyone..  your meds are for you and you only  ***there are legal consequences if you are caught*** ***there are medical consequences to those who take this medication in certain instances*** (ex. interaction with other meds)  do NOT give your medication to anyone. do NOT sell your medication.  I know this is hard for people .... especially those on generics or people who live in countries with great health programs.  Cautionary Tale:  a bottle of ritalin used to cost me about 10 bucks and i could sell pills at 10 a pill! No money and school bills... and I caved. I would hand off a buddy a bottle and my electricity bill was paid. done deal.  WRONG.  Found out that he/she sold a pill to someone on other medication and had a terrible reaction (seizure). The guilt was awful.   *Some interactions with ADD/ADHD meds*:  * can change the effectiveness of hypertention medication,seizure meds * can change the effectiveness of anti-depressants * DO NOT MIX WITH ALCOHOL * can effect those with diabetes, glaucoma, seizures * can interact with other medications used to treat mental illness  Now, legal consequences.   Most of you wont be thinking about this - but what happens if someone takes your medication across the border? This is considered drug smuggling and your name is on the bottle!  here are some examples of charges in various countries for smuggling:  20 years in prison: Tunisia 30 years in prison: Venezuela Death Penalty: Algeria, Iran, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand   Hope to have convinced just one of you to think twice before handing a pill to your buddy.

I've been diagnosed with BP (which I'm certain is accurate) and now he diagnosed me with ADD. I did a little research and asked about having an ECG before going on any stimulant. It's possible my late parent may have had a heart murmur and a few times a year I can get intense but short-lived chest pains.     He insisted that it wasn't necessary and that these medications are safe. I'm unsure and wanted to see if anyone else has been in the same boat. Thanks!

I wanted your thoughts on medication. All of you were very helpful. I did start my child on meds and have been on that hamster wheel since.  I was initally concerned about "throwing" medications at a problem for all the reasons people worry. Many of you assured me it did help and I wanted to by guided by his need rather than my notions.  We started with Adderall. WHAT A DIFFERENCE. I went from a withdrawn, anxious, angry child to one that smiled, engaged with life and people. He was feeling good and doing well in school. I cannot overstate the improvements I saw in his person and esteem.  But then he grew and doses did too. We switched to Ritalin and now those doses have grown too. I'm told he is still on a low dose but I am super frustrated with doctors and prescribing and a lack of guidance/education on our options. I worry about giving my child progressively larger doses of amphetamines. Perhaps that is my ignorance but the last prescription I got was for a 24 hr release (ER). Neither him nor I need him on Ritalin during hours when he should be sleeping.  I wanted to come to you guys again for your thoughts since they were so helpful to me last time. Have others been through similar experiences, struggled with similar worries about achieving the best balance? Have others have found alternate therapies that work well?  As always, I appreciate all input.

I was diagnosed with ADHD 2 years ago and have been on 10mg Adderall XR for 1 year.  I just got back from the doctor for the third time this week.  I've had jaw pain and swelling on the left side for four days, it hurts to chew solid foods, and after FINALLY getting to see my own doctor (Pain started on Sunday, then MLK day, my doc out of town for the long weekend, blahblah) was finally diagnosed with Salivary Gland Stones.  Apparently, though there can be several causes, they're linked to reduced salivary production from medications like stimulants, antihistamines, etc.  I can tell you, the pain is a real bummer and the swelling is messing up my pretty face. :)  Good news is that the prescription is lots of water and CANDY to promote salivary production and try to flush the thing out on its own.  Otherwise, it's minor, though sucky, surgery.  TL;DR Hydrate well while on stimulant medications and suck on hard candies for good measure.  Learn from my pain. :)

I'd always had a hunch I was ADHD, and have been just overwhelmed lately. Read some stuff here and got in with a psychologist who specializes in ADHD. Went to several sessions with her, and she states that she is almost certain I am, and that she thinks my mother likely is too.   I told another friend of mine who is also diagnosed, and she gave me some of her adderral. It's instant release, small pink round ones. I've been splitting it in half and taking half in the morning and half in the afternoon and it's done wonders.   I have an appointment with the actual Doc next monday that my psychologist referred me to to get meds. I'm wondering if I should stop taking the meds prior to going? Are they going to do blood tests and things or just kind of go over what me and the psych talked about? I don't want to mess this up, because it helps me a lot.   Thank you!

Instead of the usual anectodes akin to "Whoah man Vitamin C cured my ADHD", I'm more interested in supplements that flat out did nothing for ADHD, had intolerable side effects, or even aggravated symptoms.  I believe these kind of personal experiences would be useful to combat the huge amount of misinformation and anecdotes flying around the nets that only complicates things for us.

Throughout my life I've always felt like I am not who I want to be - the way I express myself externally is so different to how I feel deep down and there's nothing I can do about it.   As a late diagnosee (is that a word?) I only recently realized just how much of my personality has been molded around either my ADHD symptoms, the way I have had to deal with them all my life, or the way I have had to deal with people's attitudes towards me as a result of ADHD. I recently told my parents about my ADHD and they passed it off as no big deal (I think to make me feel better about myself, sometimes they are *too* supportive and helpful), and they said it's just who I am.  But I like to think that my personality would be different if I was diagnosed earlier and knew the cause of the problems.  Or am I wrong?  Do I *have* ADHD, or *am* I ADHD??

The same can be found in r/askscience. For those of you don't know these are verified by mailing evidence to the mods privately.   How this would benefit average users: when those who are experts reply we will know that their response is backed up by years of dedicated study. There is a lot misinformation and armchair explanations out there so anything to verify information is helpful.  How this would benefit those with degrees: those who have knowledge under their belt can help more people and feel appreciated for their study. Of course these people should never answer medical questions as they can be held somewhat responsible. But these professional could answer general questions and research.

I've seen quite a few "Xmg didn't work for me, so I took two pills, three, pills, etc... and now I'm worried about (insert problem here)" threads lately.   No matter how smart you think you are, YOU ARE NOT YOUR DOCTOR. If you feel your meds aren't working as well as they should, then bring it up with your psych/GP/NP, etc... They should be the ones to have a better solution. They need you to be honest with them, so they can use that insight to properly treat you. We cannot diagnose you, we also cannot give you medical advice.   Your doctor has spent years, more than you ever will, in the field of medicine. They are trained, educated to know about diseases, drugs, symptoms, side effects, etc... You are not. Do not deviate from your prescribed dose, do not take more than you should. It is illegal to take more than what's written on your bottle without your doctor's consent.  These are powerful, addicting drugs. They are also very effective at managing your condition, with medical supervision. That prescription authorizes you to possess/take only the dose specified because your "supervisor" judged it to be appropriate for you. No more than that. So stop pretending you know what's best for you, and let your doctor treat you with the expertise they have.   TL;DR Stop taking more meds than what your doctor told you.

I notice relief of my symptoms for about 2 hours and then the inattentiveness and restlessness comes back. From what I've researched, it should relieve my symptoms for 4-8 hours. Is my dosage too low? Should I schedule an appointment with my PCP to address the issue?   EDIT: Could it possibly be due to my body mass? I'm 5'11 and 205 pounds.

Help?!;;;As the title says, I was diagnosed with ADHD halfway through my second year of university. My GPA is low, just under 2.0, and most grad school programs want a 3.0 GPA, either overall or for the last two years. Has anyone around here been through something similar? I mean, this semester is going fantastically, but I don't know if even this rate will get me to where I need for grad school. I'm resigned to taking an extra semester or two of classes, but is this realistic at all?

I have adhd, too.   I couldn't ever pay attention in class or anything that was boring, but my second semester just started and yesterday...   I paid attention. I actually wrote notes on what the teacher was saying in a way I understood. I didn't even look at my phone either which is a huge distraction for me. I'm on Methylphenidate 27mg, which I hope to increase soon.   Normally in class I'd look like a kid who just shot up heroin trying to sit still and stay awake... But I was actually sitting still, no movements of tapping or anything. I'm so proud.    Thank you, r/adhd for helping me see this side of me I didn't know. I was just diagnosed narcoleptic in October and adhd the past two weeks. My first semester I almost failed out, and now I plan on getting those A grades that I never got.
b5900eaf3008f51e8793f3efa4a53d2f73c35387962ac7d5e26aa35e9f20b406;;;ADHD and anger issues;;;Back story I'm 26, male, and have had ADHD as long as I can remember. Also currently on 54mg of concerta and 20mg ciprolex for anxiety.  I've never been good at controlling emotions or anger. As a kid I think my parents (who helped me as much as they could) thought I was being a difficult teenager so my outbursts, etc were 50% crazy kid 50% adhd. Growing into an adult has been a bit of a journey as well.  I'm good at being "normal" at work with my emotions and anger, I have other work issues but that's for another thread lol. However when people get very close to me, I stop being so "nice" and whenever I get stressed I "explode".  I was married once, we married young and were not right for each other... However I know I did a lot to hurt that relationship. My mood would change instantly, from laughing and being happy to screaming and punching the wall. I never got a handle of it, and I never treated her properly, and eventually we split up.  Now I'm engaged again, to an amazing person who is seeing my issues and being as patient as she can be. She wants to help me and wants me to get help myself, bevcuase obviously I need it. Heres last nights example:   &gt; Overall things are a little stressful in life, she is working on some imigration paperwork and I am at a newish job and just got a not so great review. But weve been through stress before. We had a nice evening and got up to do the dishes. I hate chores, I hate a messy kitchen but I hate cleaning it too. I get instantly stressed and anxious, but she tries to help me.  &gt;  &gt; Things are going good, until I put a frying pan in the dish washer. After here its very blurry. She tells me that it wont get clean, and I am going to wake up to it in the morning being messy. I got upset. What I think happened was me telling her just leave it, let me put it in, I just want to get it done. And her explaining to me why its a bad idea. I got more upset. I started going on about "is this worth arguing about, just leave it!" and got more and more upset. I left the kitchen and kept yelling "is this worth arguing over" which she calmly replied "I just wanted to explain ... ". In my mind I wanted her to say "its not worth it I'm sorry", but that's so stupid because she did nothing wrong.  &gt;  &gt; After this carried on and she started yelling out of frustration I was screaming and blaming her. The night ended with me throwing a glass on the floor and it shattering everywhere.  &gt;  &gt; We talked it through after, and again in the morning. Things are "ok" right now but we know I need help, and if I don't get it we can't do this forever. I don't' want to be like this, I hate screaming at people I love, breaking things, scaring people. I would NEVER hurt somebody physically but I fear what I'm doing might be worse.  &gt;  &gt; She said to me that its like I black out when I get angry and just explode not seeing or hearing whats around me. In my mind I just want the world to apologize and tell me they are sorry for making me mad, even though the truth is its not their fault.   I... I don't really know what to do. I'm going to talk to my family doctor (making an appointment today hopefully) with my partner, and also try to get into a psychologist that specalizes in ADHD. But I'm scared it wont work. I'm scared something "else" is wrong with me, or this is who I am. I'm scared to loose her but I'm scared if I keep her I will only be hurting her. I don't know what I'm expecting from this rant, its a new account, not a throw away. Maybe I just needed to offload today. And get real help tomorrow.

Decided to share it with you all in the hope that it might help someone today as it's helped me.;;;The plight of ADHD.  For the first time in weeks, I set a task to do and completed it. Okay, maybe I'm lying, I completed most of it except for the last 10%.   This happens to all of us; we get close to the end of something and just don't go any further.   Why?  Now my mind feels tired and it feels it deserves a reward. I was looking around the internet for something interesting to read and then scrolled through EBay to find something to buy. This time I caught myself after fifteen minutes. At least I kept from going down the rabbit hole.   Still, my brain feels tired. I take a half an adderall and nothing. I might even feel more tired now. How could have I over-exerted myself doing those three hours of work? But those three hours, I crushed it and they went by so fast. I don't think I moved from my desk once. Any non-ADHD person would understand why I might be tired; I just completed three hours (or maybe it was two) of intense work.   It's confusing and disorienting to not have any idea how much time passes when you're not looking directly at a it. It's depressing to beat yourself up all the time; with ADHD you feel it's never enough inside. You can never do "enough" because you have no idea what "enough" is; and when you always fail at doing "enough" you lose the internal motivation to not only not do "enough" but not to do "anything."  Luckily, we can meditate and think about our thinking. And maybe, navigate this weird path our brains put us on. And fortunately, not all is lost or hopeless because we may not always have control of our actions or how perceive things, but at least we can identify the patterns (we're good at that) and begin to fight back or at least acknowledge that we're not lazy, crazy, or stupid.   Our brain works funny and thats okay, and we know it.

I found this subreddit maybe a week or two ago, and...I'm a bit confused by the people on here.  I was diagnosed with ADD when I was 8.  I'm 29 now.  I have never abused my drugs.  I knew it was possible, but it seemed stupid.  I noticed, even at that early age, that people responded to me better when I had taken my meds than when I didn't.  As the years passed, I noticed other things:  My mom wasn't so angry at me.  I could get my schoolwork done.  Other things, like puberty (mine) and literal insanity (my mother's) started becoming more prominent in my life.  At 17, I, too, had some serious anger issues.  Punching holes in walls, couldn't keep friends.  It wasn't the meds, it was my life that was the problem.  Took me a number of years and going FAR AWAY to college to figure it all out.  I stayed on the meds.  One adderall XR a day, no late night classes.  Make sure I sleep enough.  Don't skip days.  Take medication vacations over 3 day weekends (recommended, although it made me hate 3 day weekends).  I knew I was taking amphetamines.  20 years ago, when I was diagnosed, the doctor told me I would want to not be on the meds forever, because it would be damaging my heart.  That was scary.  Today, I'm still on the meds.  Or, rather, back on them.  Thanks to a) getting prego/having a baby b) losing my job and my insurance, I haven't taken them for over a year now, and it has been a wild ride.  I'm glad for the path I've taken, being responsible, getting my life in order....and it's funny to see how little I can get done when I don't have them in my system.  Funny meaning terrible.  I've hated it.  I love who I am on my medications  I went to the doctor yesterday, and he re-diagnosed me as ADD(inattentive type) using a screening tool.  First time I've been diagnosed since I was 8, and I was kind of shocked at how well many of the questions described my frustrations of the past year.  I've noticed that on this subreddit, there is not a lot of positivity surrounding the medications that the problem we all share, and I just have to wonder why?  Is the medication so much worse for everyone else?  Are there only a few people who talk about it?  Are your lives not enriched by having greater focus?  What;s up with that?
05b02f5ab5ed5bd7e676256ca00650b2c1ef99181024a959242e73c3e754ea4d;;;Was diagnosed ADHD primarily H, after six years on Adderall I'm now primarily I?;;;When I was 25 I was diagnosed as ADHD with a serious emphasis on the H. Focus wasn't so much of a problem, but bouncing off the walls, twitchiness, uncontrollable fidgeting, and severe anxiety all were. I actually had more of a hyper-focus issue, where once my brain got stuck on something I couldn't stop thinking about it (leading to anxiety many times).   My doctor put me on Adderall XR 10mg twice daily, and that's the med I've been on since. It worked really well for a while, but over the last year I've been developing serious inattentive issues where I drift off in the middle of doing something and just start daydreaming or switch over to doing something else without even thinking about the thing I was doing before.  Is this common?  I feel like my meds have just changed the primary type of my ADHD rather than fixing it.   I talked to my doctor already, and we're trying out Strattera now. It's way too early to say if that's working or not, but I'm really curious about this side effect of Adderall. Is it even a side effect? Is it possible my brain chemistry has just changed? I have done the short medication vacations, and my hyperactivity comes back after a day or two. My ability to focus gets slightly better off the Adderall, but it's still pretty decreased from what I'm used to.  The only time I feel my focus come back to productive levels is on days when I have bad pain and I take Ultram along with my Adderall. Then suddenly I'm focused and calm and ready to take on any project thrown my way. Since I don't want to start taking my pain-killers every day, and I won't drive on them, so they're out of the question on work days, just taking Adderall and Ultram isn't really an option.   **TL;DR: Went from ADHD-H to ADHD-I after six years on Adderall. Now I'm only able to focus when I take Ultram with my Adderall. WTF?**
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;ADHD and Anxiety;;;Hello fellow ADHD-ers,  I have a co-morbid diagnosis of ADHD-C and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. I am being treated with Celexa for the OCD and Adderall XR for the ADHD.   I am currently reading Driven to Distraction and in it the author describes a type of ADHD called ADHD-Anxiety. The description of ADHD-Anxiety is someone who uses worry or worrying about something to distract them and keep their brains active. This describes how I interact with anxiety perfectly and I am wondering if maybe I need to bring this up to my psychiatrist.   Do any of you have ADHD- Anxiety? Are you being treated for both ADHD and OCD? How have you treated the worrying aspect? Do you have any tips on getting over worries and being productive? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Did you select different/less demanding work? Really up your structure? Was it worth it?   Background: I'm 1 week into a return to medicating my ADHD. I was on ritalin as a kid for awhile, but hated the zombie-like side effects and begged my parents to let me not take it. When my grades were ok and only my behavior was crappy, they agreed. Guess I was smart enough to get by (at least in public schools). I returned for a re-diagnosis in college and was on and off adderall from then and through grad school, taking long stints off of meds only to have to go through the entire doctor dog and pony show again each time. I just hated the side effects: thirst (ok dry mouth), sweaty palms, headaches, and of course the sleep issues (I already have some insomnia/issues staying asleep and take low dose trazadone to help me get more than 4 or 5 hours). So here I am, back again. This time on 30mg of Vyvanse. So far it's MUCH better than my experiences with straight adderall. I still have the sweaty hands and thirst, but considerably less crash and a much longer arch of effecetiveness. I just reached a point where I was spending 1/2 my work time goofing off and paying dearly for it, and losing things, and generally being flaky, which is not my personality really. I'm just trying to figure out if I want to deal with the side effects, constant doctor visits &amp; medication adjustments etc. for the long haul. It really makes a difference, but is also a lot of effort.    edit: grammar/clarification

I was diagnosed 2 months ago and I take 10mg Adderall twice daily and the difference is amazing. I am angry with myself because i waited so long and realized that I could have done much better in my undergraduate studies. I knew I had concentration problems but always put off seeing my doctor about it. Anyone else angry or regret not seeking a doctor sooner rather then later?  EDIT: I'm a Chemistry major as well and plan to apply for research jobs/ internships and would it be wise in an interview to say that my gpa isn't up to par because, (insert ADHD information here).

He's fairly certain I have (Inattentive-type) ADD, which I've suspected for years, though says under current rules of diagnosis a diagnosis of comorbid autism/ADD isn't possible (don't know why...). Anyway, this opens up a lot of options medication-wise if the psychiatrist I'm seeing in a fortnight agrees and offers to prescribe me stimulants.  I've been self-prescribing Modafinil for almost a year now with good results, it stops me from being so tired all the time and aids focus but I've tried ritalin-like drugs before (ethylphenidate) and Modafinil is no comparison to the motivational qualities of these drugs though they also have their side effects like addictive qualities and comedowns. The psych said I may be offered to continue prescribed, NHS-quality Modafinil or even switched to ritalin or other more ADD-aimed drugs (not adderall because UK though). I'm just looking for some different opinions on Ritalin if it's offered to me. In short, I'd love to be more motivated, but concerned about addiction/crashing/general uncleanness of these stimulants.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;FINAL YEAR Uni student NEEDS HELP. URGENT.;;;Hi there, So as the caption says. I'm a final year undergrad University student. Studying Photography. I was re-diagnosed with ADHD last September. For the first two years, I struggled a lot. I mean, I always struggled in school but never repeated years, just passed while always having mitigations/time extensions. This year was supposed to be different, it was supposed to be a year where I could show everyone (and myself) what I'm capable of. Sadly I had problems with funding and I couldn't afford to do many things and my mental health suffered with it a lot. I started with Concerta, ended up on high 56mg daily and it was't working for me and side effects were absolutely horrible. So now I'm on Dexamphetamine. It kinda works but I'm still lacking significant knowledge how to deal with my anxieties, depression and most important, my organisation skills and being able to follow through with my coursework. Also as a typical ADHD'r, I'm having relationship problems (I'm 25 F) which is a horrible distraction during my last year; meeting all the wrong guys that simply fuck me up. So back to important stuff: I was granted extension/mitigation for my first semester, yet the due date was Jan/31 and I still haven't handed it in. I need to do a workbook for one of the projects in the form of a blog, my Final Major Project extended proposal and work in progress, a workbook plus prints of a test shoot. Photographic Business has assigned a whole bunch of PebblePad questions, evaluations, a website and whole loads of other crap that my friend (who also has a learning difficulty) said took her just a day to complete. I also have one massive evaluation of my self-published book as well as a dissertation proposal for tomorrow (Feb/21 by 4pm London/UK time) which is just 500 words so I hope I can smash it. You might ask whats my point? The point is- I'm freaking scared and feeling really hopeless right now. I can't get time extensions for my final semester as I wont be able to attend the graduation ceremony in July. They need to assess us right after our exhibition in the first week of June. I'm lacking of motivation and I'm simply feeling like I won't make it. I'm scared of disappointing myself and my family and simply being ashamed of the failure. It's the last few months where I could actually do everything, yet I'm scared and I don't even know where to begin. I know I'm already in trouble for not handing in my work that was already extended, of which I'm now a month late. I'm feeling like a headless chicken. I got great ideas for my final projects and my portfolio is apparently pretty good, it's just the conceptual and writing work I'm struggling with. I can't structure myself at all. I went on counselling from my university and it wasn't helpful at all. I really need help, some advice, a kick in my butt, some pats on my shoulder telling me "you can do it"... anything. I really want to get out of my black hole of sadness and get on with my work, graduate and be a successful photographer. I just can't get out of my vicious cycle of the same mistakes and bad routines. Excuse so much writing, meds just start working. TL;DR: Really need help. Already late with last semester's work, tons of work for the new semester. I can't get extensions for my final semester as I won't be able to attend the graduation ceremony. I need motivation and some help.
743c622ba2a0d6d423b95a97bd664bedf4c5906e6eeb4484f02b0ce5966b91a5;;;Diagnosed about a month ago, ramped up my Dexedrine dose from 10 mg to 30 mg a day and starting to feel unbalanced.;;;So I posted on here about a month ago when I was first diagnosed with ADHD. I really appreciate the advice and support I got from you guys. I was posting from a throwaway account because I was embarassed, but I am no longer. May as well be loud and proud about it. Finding out I had ADHD explains a lot about my life. Since seeing my doctor weekly, he has been ramping up my dose of Dexedrine from 10mg (5mg IR 2x daily) a day to 30 mg (15mg spansule 2x daily). At first 30mg felt like it was the "sweet spot" for me... but now I'm not so sure.  Since taking medication I had been feeling relatively good, more balanced and productive. Being less of a scatterbrain also really helped me! I'm finishing up my last semester at university, which commands a lot of my attention. However, I am currently also starting a wedding photography business and have been trying to get it going for three years now. It's finally going somewhere, because now I am absolutely OBSESSED with it. To the point where I'm neglecting class, midterm papers and not studying for exams. I am happy that I have re found the passion for photography I once had. I pretty much gave it up after developing depression last year.  So now, I am no longer depressed. Yay. I love working on my future, playing in photoshop, tweaking my facebook and webpage. But now school = oops I forgot about it. Monday night I pulled an all nighter to finish a paper. I went to school the next morning to hand it in, and then skipped all of my classes to go home and work on my business. Didn't end up going to sleep until 9pm and was awake for over 36 hours straight. Then I ended up sleeping for 13 hours Tuesday night, but then skipped my classes yesterday morning because I could not wake up, and again, worked on my business. Last night again I just was not tired, I laid in bed until 4am until I decided to be productive and get up to work on my business. I ended up writing a 800 work Resource and FAQ page for my clients.  Extreme productivity has taken over my life. Since then, I have also dropped from 112lbs to 102lbs- being 4'11 it's not so bad. But I am quite worried. I don't want to go back to the old me, but maybe a happy medium where I am balanced with all of my endeavours. In the last few weeks I have been trying to maintain a detailed calendar of every single task, down to brushing my teeth. It's not working anymore though. BUSINESS!!!  I'm really wondering, is this shit normal? Is that why everybody hates their meds after a while? Should I try a lower dose for a few days and see if it helps? Or was my dose increased too quickly perhaps?  Thanks you folks kindly in advance for any input! :)  TL; DR I've been on Dexedrine for about a month, dose ramped up from 10mg to 30 mg/day. I've lost 10lbs and am becoming over productive. My life feels like a blur right now.
df494b9e84bc0b8797710faa46f493e69238e1e5090f6b58b92128ebe6c43f9d;;;Are you happy?;;;Ever since I was around 16/17 and the once distant world of adulthood and responsibility started to become a reality, I have felt like I will never be happy.   Whether it was due to feeling 'different' or 'on another level' to most people because of ADHD, I've always had this underlying belief deep down that things would never go my way in life, even when I am actually feeling really happy and optimistic about things. Is it something that is ingrained in me because of my constant underachievement in life, or is it an actual emotional symptom of ADHD?   It's not depression because I've been through that and I know what it feels like, it's more like a pessimism. But (like a lot of symptoms that we have due to ADHD), this pessimism isn't who I really am. I am generally a very positive person with a lot going for me, so I know that I shouldn't have this feeling inside of me. So it makes me wonder if it's an emotional fault in my brain that is characteristic of ADHD, and if so, is it common? Sometimes I think it's because of the constant noise in my head due to ADHD, because I guess that's basically the opposite of what people call inner peace.  So I guess my question is:   Are you truly happy?   Or does ADHD make you constantly feel like you will never be at peace with yourself?

First of all, I want to explain myself.  This disorder has been getting progressively worse over the past couple years.  I'm 17 and a junior in High School who is taking mostly honors classes.  Now, me last year would have tackled these classes no problem.  I'd be doing homework every night, and studying for tests for hours, ensuring I do exceptional.  However, this year is not like last year.  I develop cases of the "Fuck-its" where I say I'll do it later.  I'll do it later.  I'll do it later.  And then forget about it.  I also have had some episodes where I will get extremely emotional. This varies from excitement, to depression, to anger.  I'll burst out crying, laughing, or I'll punch the nearest wall or slam on the desk I'm sitting at.     It's a endless nightmare and it's killing me.  I need advice on how to calm down, how to sit and study and how to get shit done.  I want to do a lot of things, but I try to do them all at once and none of them get done.      TL;DR  I want to get shit done and calm down.  How would I approach this? And should I try the medication they give me (Is it worth it)?

Because I take Omeprazole (PPI) daily the IR works better. Problem is, the doctor at the practice I currently go to mentioned he wouldn't up my current dose (15mg IR x2 daily) because that would put me above 30mg a day. He pretty much made a point of saying that's the way it is, and it's not changing.  Anyone else have experience with this? Should I just switch doctors? I honestly think I need to get 15mg x3 daily due to the omeprazole or maybe even 20mg x3 daily.  Edit: To clarify --&gt; Omeprazole = heartburn medication. My ADHD med is adderall x2 daily 15mg
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;I live with my ADHD SO and am feeling hopeless. Tell me what I'm doing wrong and what to do next, please.;;;I love my SO of five years. I have known about his ADHD our whole relationship and try my best to be understanding. There are a lot of great things in our relationship and I have no plans to leave him, ever. But I'm only going to talk about the difficult stuff here because I need some perspective/help. I'm going to sound like a bitch in this post but I need to be honest and I need some honest advice. So this is basically what I think/feel when I'm in my shittiest/darkest moods.   I feel like being in a relationship with someone with such severe ADHD has made me feel like a martyr. I feel like our relationship consists of him existing in his "natural" state, with no regard for me, while I go crazy trying to stop us from going broke, from living in a dump, from going no where. I have to cook, clean, do our laundry, take out the trash, pay the bills, etc. He feels guilty and always tells me he will do it next time but he never does. And a reminder is enough to make him snap at me for nagging and shut down.  I feel like a terrible person for getting frustrated or resentful, but I don't know how to turn off those feelings. On a selfish level, when I'm especially frustrated I can't help but feel like it's unfair. I know he can't help it and isn't doing this on purpose, so it's ridiculous for me to feel like this. And I try to be patient. But when bills are coming in and I'm the only one paying because he doesn't work enough hours, or when I'm working my ass off all week while he's at home not working and I have to come home to a completely filthy house (that he promised me he would clean over and over again) I can't help but think that I am making a huge sacrifice to be with him. I could be with someone without ADHD, and I wouldn't have to work myself so drastically just to get by. And that's what bothers me - I feel like our relationship depends on me adapting and changing to suit HIM and what HE can do, and he doesn't seem to have to make any sort of sacrifice because "he can't help it". I break my back to accomodate him and he does nothing. It feels like the only way to help him to get or keep work or finish the things he needs to do is to be a mother to him and to be honest it grosses me out sometimes.   He tells me he can't control it. I try to understand that. But I honestly don't think he makes an effort to understand ME, and how important it is to me to not feel like I'm being used as a maid, cook, mom, etc. Every so often I break down and cry and talk to him about it and try to make him understand and he swears he will try everything he can but then.. nothing.  If I want to stay with him, which i do, what are my options? Is  a realationship between a ADHD person and a non ADHD person just destined to be like this..  You can probably tell I'm frustrated. I'm in tears over this. Please, any advice would really, really help.

I scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist for tomorrow in approximately nine hours. I was diagnosed as a child(4th grade) and stop taking meds after a while and completely forgot about all of it. I had mentioned to a friend a while back that coffee makes me tired and he told me that I may have ADHD. Then I forgot about that.  Fast forward to last week, two cups of coffee, 10 AM, ready for another eight hours of sleep. Then I remember what friend said and called for an appointment after matching up symptoms to myself and ADHD. I wasnt sure that ADHD was my problem until an hour ago. I got on this subreddit, hit top&gt;all. And found that I am able to relate to every single fucking thing everyone has posted.  It feels very good to know where to go from here.

I've been doing some research into ADHD and I belive I have it. These are the symptoms that match me (extremely closely)  &gt;“zoning out” without realizing it, even in the middle of a conversation extreme distractibility; wandering attention makes it hard to stay on track   &gt;difficulty paying attention or focusing, such as when reading or listening to others   &gt;struggling to complete tasks, even ones that seem simple   &gt;tendency to overlook details, leading to errors or incomplete work   &gt;poor organizational skills (home, office, desk, or car is extremely messy and cluttered)   &gt;tendency to procrastinate  &gt;trouble starting and finishing projects   &gt;chronic lateness   &gt;frequently forgetting appointments, commitments, and deadlines   &gt;constantly losing or misplacing things (keys, wallet, phone, documents, bills)   &gt;underestimating the time it will take you to complete tasks  &gt;sense of underachievement   &gt;doesn’t deal well with frustration   &gt;easily flustered and stressed out   &gt;irritability or mood swings   &gt;trouble staying motivated   &gt;hypersensitivity to criticism   &gt;short, often explosive, temper   &gt;low self-esteem and sense of insecurity  &gt;feelings of inner restlessness, agitation    &gt;getting bored easily   &gt;racing thoughts   &gt;trouble sitting still; constant fidgeting   &gt;craving for excitement   &gt;talking excessively   &gt;doing a million things at once   I was reading through these and I realized its a textbook definition of my life, and has been for quite a while.   The problem is, my parents think that ADD/ADHD is just an excuse for lazy people who want to take drugs so they don't have to improve themselves. I think it's because we used to know a lot of people who's kids had ADHD, and they assumed it was a common thing, I'm not sure    Either way, I would really like to get some kind of  help for it, but im not sure my parents would think the same.

I am really excited to be finally getting help for this (thanks to finally having insurance) and I was given a packet that starts with very low doses and works up to eventually 40 mg. I believe I'm somewhere in the realm of 16 or 18 mg right now.  Anyway, I have been under a considerable amount of stress the last few days, as I'm simultaneously dealing with some basic "life" issues (car problems, finances, etc.) but I have began noticing that as I am occasionally fretting over these issues, since I began taking the Strattera (on my 3rd day) I am beginning to have what I'm guessing are palpitations. I don't know if this is a common trait in this medicine or if I'd even be having this sort of reaction this quickly, but is this something I should red alert about or is it just my body adjusting and something that will subside?  I really want to have treatment and I really don't want to be taking amphetamines if I can help it. I want this to work, but I don't know how soon it will start taking effect or if this is something even being caused by this drug. Any experience with this anyone?

The things that others have written really just clicks, sometime the words could just as well have been mine. I live in Sweden, FYI.)  **Background**  So I'm in university now. It's been going okay I guess since childhood (everybody has their fair share of problems, right?) but now I need more "concentration over time" than I can muster. The times where I can really concentrate can't get me through all the things I need to learn. So I lag behind, missing deadlines of assignments and just barely passing on exams. I could get through and get my degree but what would I really have learned?  The school psychologist, whom I went to in search of some kind of solution, hasn't suggested anything but then again we've just had one talk. I haven't told of my thoughts on this being some form of ADHD because I'm afraid I might be taken for someone who's after the drugs in order to study better or get better grades. Well, I guess that could be what I'm after it it actually helps, but there's a much greater impact on my life because of this which I have always felt really helpless about.  I might come off as very casual/analytical about this, but I have cried and thought enough about the implications it has on my life and don't feel the need to write about it right now.  Maybe it isn't even some form of ADHD, but it seems I have a lot of problems in common with the rest of you, so maybe your methods would work in my case as well? I'm looking for help, not a label.  **Some ideas**  I was thinking, what I need is something outside of myself that can kind of pinch me when I just let go of whatever it is I'm doing. I can't really catch myself in the moment, no matter how many reminders/notes or how scheduled my day/week/month/year is. I even forget to do implement things that I've made to help me not to forget.  My mind just slips away into something entirely else and there is no thought process or decision behind it, at least that's what it feels like. Moments or hours later I would remember - *oh shit, that was what I was supposed to do again, well, better get back on track*. Another moment passes, and then I'm gone again.  I really rely on those times where I can hyperfocus, as the proper (?) term seem to be. But I can't do it often enough. Or rather, I can't choose the task I can focus on.  * I've been thinking about some form of self-medication, but it seems alcohol and weed are kind of a slippery slope, and I'm not sure I would even want to try that out. I'm way too scared of a potential downward spiral.   * Coffee doesn't effect me, except for... gas.  * Cats are like a favorite of mine and I thought for sure a cat would help. At least it's something with a "clock" and reactions of its own. There would be another consciousness in the room and that could maybe be of some help. But then again, I'm allergic to cats so that's that. Maybe a dog? I'm not sure I could take care of it properly. Maybe.  * I think whatever this thing is it has to be intelligent enough to notice when I'm zoning out. Maybe a service dog? I don't think I could get that kind of help, and even if I could, the path to get there would be long, because I heard the investigations to get a diagnose are super long (as well as waiting times).  * Some kind of audible timer would be best, and I think I've tried that in the past but found it incredibly annoying to be reminded every 5/10 minutes. Maybe I could implement it some other way?  So I guess now is the time when you call me lazy or tell me I'm not serious or maybe you give me some tip on how to go about this.

Now that I have my diagnosis I'm trying to understand myself better and improve my coping strategies.  So I was just wondering if anyone else ever deliberately triggers a state of 'hyperfocus' (that might not be the right word), or if you find that being out of breath makes your brain work faster. I work in retail and when I have to put a lot of stock out in a short amount of time, I have this thing I do where I start moving really fast and deliberately making my breathing short and quick. I go kind of light-headed but I guess the lack of oxygen triggers an adrenaline boost or something and I can work very very quickly with hyperfocus. I get even more clumsy but it doesn't slow me down somehow and nothing distracts me. I can work like three times as fast when I deliberately put myself in this state but I don't do it all the time because it's tiring and probably no good for me, I save it for emergencies. Similarly, when I'm at home and I'm trying to think about something complicated, I'll jump up and down or run up and down the hallway, and somehow being out of breath makes me think faster.   So does anyone else find being out of breath helps them think faster, and do you ever do this on purpose?

I'm new here, but that many of you might benefit from a tool that I built to make insurance comparison shopping easier. It allows you to input the name of a medication to see how each insurance provider covers it.   **[RxCompare](http://rxcompare.pill-fill.com)**  If you're looking for new insurance to cover your ADHD medications, I think this might be helpful. I built it after getting frustrated trying make sense of dozens of 100+ page formularies myself.  The tool focuses primarily on states without their own healthcare exchange, so not everything is covered. There's also no advertising, sponsorships, or dirty revenue model- it's just a tech experiment I did to see if we could make finding an insurance that covers your medications easier than it currently is. Let me know if you have any suggestions on how to make this more useful!

I didn't know this existed. So I went. Got there at 10 and saw a guy at 3.  They had asked me a bunch of questions previously of course, but they didn't seem to have access to my medical file and didn't seem to take adhd seriously at all. He asked me what I wanted to do. I did not expect this. I asked him what he thought and he said therapy sounded like what would help the most.  I think if I'd asked for now adhd medication he might have tried one, but I was totally taken aback at the idea of making that sort of decision. I said I couldn't trust myself to make that decision. And that was that. I left.  Not like it matters now, but if I were ever to have access to any sort of adhd treatment, it was through this appointment. I blew it. That was it.  Guess I have to just cope. Maybe I don't have adhd anyway. You know, despite being diagnosed twice.  Why am I such an idiot. Where is the nearest bridge?  Edit: this is a fairly large overreaction.  I was angry. I'm sorry, I do realize that therapy will probably help, even if it takes weeks, and that for now it couldn't hurt to learn to cope.
0c93b6d81d1e47f6ddcdea8f3e07d41158abbdd06733600eb67708c5598aee16;;;"We'll help you get through college... just kidding haha PSYCH!" alternative title: "Who has advice on how to handle my college administration screwing me over in the 11th hour?";;;So I’m currently a 5th year senior at a large university.  I feel I should mention that it’s a good university.  A really damn good one.  I’m not trying to brag (I’m a music major and have nothing to brag about since I was admitted on audition results alone, decidedly NOT my high school grades, work ethic, or general intelligence), but I mention this because it makes my school’s lack of resources for ADHD students all the more shocking.  After an abysmal failure of a Freshman year, visits to 2 psychologists, and an ADHD-PI and GAD diagnosis, I entered Sophomore year of college on medication and feeling sane for the first time in my life.  Even though things were looking up, I still had to meet with the Associate Dean to explain my 1.2 GPA.  I met with her several times over the course of the year and she was actually phenomenally helpful.  We made a plan for academic coursework and she gave some great advice on dealing with ADHD in college.  Her recommendation was that I pursue the normal degree path as much as possible, but she warned me that roadblocks can arise for students in this situation.  If issues should present themselves, she suggested a couple options for seeking academic accommodations.  More on that later...  Unfortunately she left the school after my Sophomore year for a new job.  Not long after that I did indeed start running into roadblocks.  My prescriptions would lose effectiveness, and switching was often brutal.  Even when they work well, the medications don’t cure everything.  I still can’t stay interested in a class all semester.  I can’t concentrate on long term projects.  I don’t think I’ve ever started an essay earlier than 2 days before the due date.   And yet, I’ve scraped by with “good enough” grades and no intent of ever attending grad school.  I realized I’d have to stay a 5th year - even though I lost my scholarship after the 4th - and have spent the past 2 years on the medication that works “best.”  It keeps me from sleeping most nights, I have frequent headaches from teeth grinding, and it’s not as effective as it used to be, but it mostly works.  I’m exhausted ya’ll.  I’m so ready to be done.  In planning out my last semesters, I realized that I’d have to break down and seek academic accommodations for just a very small handful of required credits, 6 in total, or risk doing failing my other classes.  That brings me back to the advice of the Associate Dean.  She suggested a couple options I might look at.  First would be to take summer classes, which in very rare cases can replace required classes.  Second, the more viable option, is credit by examination.  [This](http://i.imgur.com/GvNMMDD.png) is the description of credit by examination, directly from the student handbook.  Note the “applicable to all courses listed” part.  Obviously it’s a viable option, right? Am I crazy?  Last week I went to the registrar’s office to request credit by examination.  10 minutes later, I walked away completely stunned, having just been told that Credit by Examination wasn’t possible.  She never gave me a specific reason, never addressed the fact that credit by examination is a clearly valid option that was recommended to me by a Dean for god’s sake.  In the moment, I regret to say, I was speechless and didn’t even know how to argue.  Several days later, after collecting my thoughts, I emailed her to reiterate my argument.  The only concession in her reply was that I could “try” emailing the head of the music theory department (who coordinates the classes I’m missing), but that “chances aren’t good.”  Otherwise, she said, I won’t be graduating.  Here’s the insult added to so much injury: one of the classes is only offered in the Fall semester.  The other, only in Winter/Spring.  That means I’d have to stay an *entire extra year,* taking just 3 credits per semester.  f**k. that.  I emailed the head of the Theory Department.  No response yet.  So I emailed the University’s SSD (Services for Students with Disabilities) department.  “Sure, there are accommodations for ADHD students” they said.  Turns out all they allow is for students to have a separate room in which to take their exams.  Being ADHD-PI, that doesn’t really address the problem, and I told them so.  Their response was that the University simply doesn’t seem willing to address concerns from ADHD students, even at the recommendation of SDD and Psychological Services, but that I could contact the head of the department.  Which I already did.  That’s where it stands.  Am I wrong to be furious?  I’ve been here 5 years, done my best, lost my scholarship, paid out of state tuition, and I’ve never asked for special treatment despite the many difficulties from ADHD and GAD.  Now I’ve requested an option that was recommended to me by a *Dean* and is supposedly open to all students for any course, and I’m being denied without reason.    Has anyone experienced anything like this?  Any advice?  I’m at such a loss.       **TL;DR** I was told by a Dean who’s no longer at the University that I should be able to seek academic accommodation for problems associated with ADHD and GAD.  Specifically, she said I could use a provision in the student handbook/University policy stating that students (any students, not related to mental issues) can fill requirements via credit by examination for any course.  Now, in my 5th year, having lost my scholarship but completed all other credits without ever seeking accommodation, I request to fill 6 final credits via examination.  The Registrar said no.  No reason given.  If that stands, I would have to stay an *entire extra year* because one class is only offered in Fall, the other only in Winter.  An entire extra year, at 3 credits a semester.  f**k. that.

Also, I'm looking through the records and there are a ton of prescription refills over the course of 7 years, but I can't pinpoint the exact diagnosis. Is that going to be an issue?

I brought up getting tested once to my mom in high school, but she told me that nothing would actually change by getting diagnosed, so I let the matter drop. Looking back I'm wondering if she either didn't believe me or was worried about the medication. I've dealt with it in my own ways over the years, but it's getting to the point where I feel like it's interfering with my life. I can't finish any projects I've started, I feel frustrated and restless, hell, I can't even keep my room clean for more than a day. My question is, is it worth it to go through all of that to get a diagnosis?

Help? :(;;;I'm at my wits end with reality and the notion of coping with my ADHD via naturopathic methods. A little background, I was on an effective ADHD medication off and on for a few months shy of a year, up until a specific event served as a catalyst for my psychiatrist dropping me completely. I thought, whatever, no problem, i'll go see a new doctor. Fast forward to seeing the new psych, apparently my last doctor labeled me as a high risk patient, which in my opinion, was highly unwarranted. Now I can't get the medication I need and as a result i've been dealing with really severe depression, I can't focus on anything at all, and i've been generally pessimistic about life in general. Like this sucks. I used to be an incredibly productive person, enjoyed a lot of scholarly activities, I studied everything under the sun and I read all the time. I'm honestly starting to lose my shit. I don't read I don't learn and I don't function. Every time I leave a doctors office with more bad news I honestly just want to say fuck it to everything. I really can't handle any more disappointment, I can't stand living life like this, and I don't know what to do anymore. I'm not in school and I was layed off from the last job I had (as a result of being wrongly diagnosed with a disorder I didn't have, forced to take a medication, and not being on my ADHD medication. I ran a truck into a building.) and my social life has all but gone to hell. I was prescribed an anti-depressant to help with it but it doesn't work at all. I've been constantly depressed for the last four months and i'm contemplating dropping out of school entirely if I can't get the help I need at my next appointment. I'm honestly losing my shit, this is a nightmarish hell and I can't handle it anymore. My quality of life like this is fucking horrible. Has anyone been dropped by a psychiatrist, and if so, how did you handle/cope with it?   edit: I'm not a whiner and I try not to bitch, but i'm at my wits end. I don't have the capacity to cope with this anymore.

I have always done well on tests (except math) throughout school and tended to end up with decent grades because of it.  I was always told I was lazy, careless and didn't show much effort on teacher comments on my report cards though as well as them saying I was shy and quiet in class.  Homework I never really did once my mom stopped making me show her my homework when I was still in elementary school.  Papers take me forever to do.  Once I start writing something if the slightest thing more interesting pops up I'm done writing.  This is a huge problem for me since for example if I am looking up something and I am reading I see a link in the text to something related but more interesting I click it and it happens again and again until something more interesting gets me off the computer.  What makes this even worse is I have a huge motivational problem with starting a homework assignment that looks longer than maybe 15-20 min.  I will procrastinate until the last minute then panic mode sets in and if I do finish in time it’s horrible and I feel bad handing it in because I know I could have done so much better.  After all this I still tend to forget to do assignments pretty often as well.  Class is awful too but I show up to most of them.  I sit down in class open up my laptop or notebook if the professor doesn't allow laptops.  I prefer laptops I have horrible handwriting.  I open up word and I start my notes with the topic of today's class then after about 10 minutes or so I start daydreaming and miss a lot of what the teacher is saying.  Other times something pops into my head and I feel the need to check the release date of a new album or video game or something like that and once I'm on the internet I tend to end up on reddit and we all know how that kills time and with all the links it takes a while to get bored.  I also see symptoms and signs of ADHD-PI outside of class/homework.  When I am talking with a friend or a group of people I tend to drift into my own little world for a minute and then come back thinking to myself "what did they just say?" (Just like in class) and I feel bad that I wasn't listening to what a friend was trying to tell me.  I'm also always losing stuff everywhere and putting things in weird places.    There's other things that I've read tend to be traits of people with ADHD that I have too.  To start we have substance abuse.  I picked up dipping tobacco at a 15 and I noticed it helped me concentrate.  I started smoking pot daily at 16 but quit after about 8 months of constant use (still occasionally smoke).  With easy access to alcohol once I got to college I ended up binge drinking almost every day of the week.  Don't worry though I quit doing that.  Oh and I also switched from dipping to smoking once I got to college as I found it more social and it helped me make a lot of my friends.  Also I notice I used tobacco less when I was using other substances and picked it up more when I wasn't.  I have also tried other drugs like Xanax, Ativan, Adderall, and Vyvance (I will get back to those last two later).  Almost forgot I also have gone on periods of time where I drink a shitload of coffee or energy drinks.   I also get what I believe is social anxiety more often than I think other people do.  It used to be worse but I've worked on that my entire life and it doesn’t interfere with my life too much anymore.  Although never diagnosed I think I may have had depression for a period of time in high school.  This was during a time when I didn't have any friends anymore and the people I thought were my friends never really were.  This didn't help my already low self-esteem I had for the longest time.  My self-esteem is much better now but still on the lower bottom end of what should be normal.    Other things about me that may or may not have to do with anything: I play guitar.  I have been playing for an about 2 1/2 years now.  It didn't really click with me until I got an acoustic guitar and learned finger style.  I wish I could play punk and metal though I just can't seem to get the hang of using a pick.  I'm not great at strumming though which I find a little strange as I am able to keep rhythm fairly well fingerpicking or playing bass.   I love video games.  I've been playing since I was 2 or 3 and I got a Nintendo 64.   I am great with technology.  I am great at troubleshooting, setting up new equipment, I took apart and rebuilt my computer with a few new parts I bought once, and you get the idea.  I find technology and computers very interesting. Although sometimes I drift off for a minute people seem to trust me quickly and talk to me if they need to vent.  I am a pretty introspective person (consequence of daydreaming a lot?) and tend to use that to help people out the best I can. I have a wide variety of random knowledge on all sorts of subjects.  I think this might be because I tend to end up wiki-surfing for extended periods of time when I try and look up something.  I may not know a ton about a subject field but I know enough for a short conversation on various topics.   I am extremely disorganized and messy.  It works well enough for me I can find stuff.  When I clean is when I tend to have a problem.  I guess I use the pile of clutter on my desk as my own type of organization, kind of like a chronological system where the item I last used is on the top and the stuff I have not touched since the last time I cleaned is at the bottom.   I procrastinate everything.  I was on my last pair of clothes before the last time I did laundry.  They stop letting people in the cafe for the day at 8? Better show up at 7:50 and end up with all the shitty food.  Procrastinating also tends to make me late a lot for stuff. I like nature.  One of my favorite things to do when it was warmer out and before I started binge drinking was to take a few shots of JD and go to this one bench and smoke cigarettes and daydream for a while until someone came to say hi.  I would be in my own little world just thinking about all sorts of stuff and making up little stories in my head.  I liked watching the squirrels climb around trees too. I like history.  I find most history very interesting and I tend to remember a lot of what I learn. I am a big fan of music.  My favorite kind of music is 90's Punk Rock like NOFX, Sublime and Rancid.  I also enjoy some pop punk like Blink-182 and Sum 41.  I like alternative bluesy rock kind of stuff too like The Black Keys and Jack White.  I like grunge like Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Soundgarden etc.  I like metal.  Mostly the slower Doom-y stuff like Black Sabbath, Electric Wizard, Kyuss.  I like reggae like Jimmy Cliff, Bob Marley and Shrub.  I like classic rock like The Rolling Stones, The Who, Pink Floyd, Grateful Dead, etc.  Recently I've been getting into electronic music too.  I've liked Daft Punk for years but didn't really get into other stuff until recently I found I like The Glitch Mob, Sabrepulse, and Swedish House Mafia. I genuinely want to do well in school and get a degree in something (currently undecided) and actually learn.  I like learning but I have general disinterest in like 95% of the classes I have ever taken and when I am not very interested it’s near impossible for me to pay attention for very long.  If I didn't have block scheduling in high school I think I would have done pretty poorly.  With such long classes I was able to zone in and out and get enough information. I never studied for school.  College was the first time I had to actually study something.  Thank God it was history.  I have a lot of trouble studying, it’s even worse than when I write a paper.  I'm fairly interested in history as I said earlier so I read enough of the lecture notes to end up with an A(the only grade above a C I got besides my introduction to college type class) I failed my first class ever last semester.  English I failed horribly I ended up with a 23% in the class.   I hate math.  I'm in a remedial math class this semester and I also learned I hate mymathlab.  Never did well in math, actually I probably should have failed all of my math classes in high school but teachers have seemed to like me most of the time and I ended up with C's in all 4 I took in high school.  Now on to what makes me think I have ADHD-PI.  Let’s start off with I'm not hyperactive except for the fact that I tend to change the way I'm sitting a lot and play with my hands a lot.  My roommate also says I fidget a lot when I'm standing still but I don't see it.  Therefore without the hyperactive symptoms I can't be ADHD or ADHD/C. When I was in middle school I heard about ADD and all I knew it meant was they have a lot of trouble paying attention to stuff.  Just knowing that I asked my mom if I have ADD and she said no your doctor would have picked up on it and it’s a good thing you don't because that medicine is bad for you (didn't know there was medication) and I never brought it up again.   During finals week last semester I came into a good amount of various types of Adderall.  I fucked up bad during the semester and fell into panic mode and being no stranger to drugs decided to try out this so called "miracle drug" Adderall that allows you to concentrate.  My roommate and both try 20mg XR and I notice he got all hyper and talked fast.  I felt calm and I was able to concentrate on my paper.  We took a break to have a cigarette.  I had a pack and he didn't so he had to wait until I went out to bum one.  I'm a heavier smoker but he had a worse craving during that time than I normally do.  I say normally because I didn't have nearly as much a desire to smoke. Fast forward to a couple weeks ago.  I one day end up with a 40mg Vyvance and I was told it was like Adderall.  I take it before my first class on my long day (back to back class from 9:30-3:00).  I had the best day ever.  My alarm went off at 8:30 I take the pill and go back to sleep.  My second alarm goes off at 9:10 and I take a shower, get dressed and go to class drinking a red bull.  I start to feel something about 30 min into class and those next 5 hours flew by.  I took amazing notes and paid attention all class.  I got back to my dorm, did laundry and by the time it was done (4 loads) my homework was also done.  That's right I wanted to do my homework and I did it.  I also had less social anxiety, I was in a happier mood than normal all day, I cleaned my room, and I was able to eat (not the normal amount but more than Adderall).  I think to myself at one point "Is this how everyone else is normally?” Fast forward to about 2 weeks ago I'm back to my normal distracted self.  I'm not doing well in school again even though I know I'm on academic probation and in danger of losing my partial scholarship and won’t be able to afford to go to school anymore if I fuck up this semester.  The thing is I really want to do well and I want to learn and I want to complete my work.  I'm writing an essay and no surprise I get distracted researching something. I come across ADHD and I start reading.  I read the symptoms and I think to myself holy shit that sounds kind of like me.  Now I'm interested and when I'm interested I lock in.  I surf the web and read all these things and the more I read the more I think this makes sense, everything makes sense if this is true.  Personal experiences, DSM 5, the effect of ADHD medication on people with and without ADHD it all makes sense.  Here's the problem, some stuff doesn't make sense to me and makes me doubt it and think I'm a hypochondriac. I can super focus on things I find interesting like the internet, videogames, television and playing music.  When I was younger I played Runescape for hours on end every day.  Later it became WoW when I was in middle school.  Oblivion and Skyrim also took up a massive amount of time.  Other games I didn't have as much of a problem because I would always beat them fairly quickly.  My mom used to say I was obsessed with videogames.  Now when I'm home my mom just calls me lazy because I watch Netflix all day every day.  Civ 5 also takes up entire days if I decided to play that every once in a while. It's possible I subconsciously just want a prescription.  Now I am going to make this as clear as I can regarding a prescription.  I want one but I also feel like if I don't get one it's not a big deal.  If I get one I don't want to be on drugs forever.  I want to learn how to cope better, have a doctor help me learn my strengths and weaknesses so that I can be successful.  I feel like a prescription given to me by a doctor could be an invaluable tool to help me recover and do well in college.  I could buy all the Adderall I want at school but I want doctor supervised so that I don't develop a habit and we can use this tool effectively.  I know I have past using substances and I like the clarity amphetamines give me.  I really want to do well in school.  I have been working with my freshman mentor, attending class, talked to the dean about me struggling and got the GPA requirement for my scholarship lowered a little bit.  I tried tutors but I either forget to go or get really annoyed when I'm there because I understand the work I just tend to forget to do it or complete it when I do remember to start it.  What do you guys think? Should I get tested?  Also in case you didn't pick up on it I'm on 20mg IR Adderall right now.  Took it at 2:15 and it is currently 6:23 before I spell check this on word.  You guys now know about all my amphetamine experiences.  Edit: Wow I wrote a lot, my bad.  If anyone takes the time to actually read this and respond thank you.  Maybe I should not drink coffee anymore.

Its like finding all the little questions you never had the answer to in life and words can't even describe to know how good it feels to finally hear/see stories i can actually connect too. people always say they have adhd but i feel are not like me or sty least heavily show symptoms like me idk. I ALWAYS overthink personal posts and delete them. hope this doesn't get deleted hii r/adhd

I feel like its so much easier to focus and get my mind on task  ex: writing an essay or text i normally wouldn't get trough without 100 breaks. BUT when I reading it the day after its so many errors but at least the work the work that i have problem get trough done. I don't normal do it or say you should just wondering if someone have the same experience ?

Well low and behold turns out I have ADHD as well as anxiety as well. Was kinda hard to take at the beginning but as I thought about it it explained a lot growing up till now, it's a relief to know that I have a disorder and that I can learn to cope with it. My wife encouraged me to read up on it, as an avid redditor this was the first place I looked, good to know there is a community online that's easily accessible. That's all I can bear to write at the moment thanks for reading if you got this far, you are to be congratulated!

(Yes, this is related to ADHD);;;Hey guys, new member of /r/ADHD and I have a question for you all. I've been recently diagnosed with ADHD-PI, but I gave myself a self-diagnosis of this months before. One of the reasons (besides inattentiveness, disorganization, etc.) was because of my **hand dominance**, or lack of. I'm **cross dominant**, which means I use my left hand for some tasks, and my right hand for others. It's so extreme that I often switch hands for similar tasks, like cutting with a knife left handed but spreading with a knife right handed, or holding a broom right handed but using it left handed. It's so varied that I was listed as ambidextrous in almost all hand dominance tests.  **Now the relevant part:** I've heard that mixed handedness, ambidexterity, and to some extent left handedness, is mostly common among people with ADHD (the reasons for why it does escapes me), and that people with these hand/feet/eye dominance issues are more likely (statistically significant, as one statistician put it) to have learning disabilities, difficulty learning languages, and learning math, than pure right handed people.  So, how many of you guys actually have this kind of dominance issue, and how has it affected you? If you did, was it inherited or totally out of the blue? I hope I'm not alone here :(  *TL;DR: Studies show cross dominance/ambidexterity is common in people with ADHD, can you guys relate?*

I can't for the life of me enjoy a feeling for long enough before my brain flips the switch from righteous anger to laughing and jokes. I'm tired of being a clown, and dammit I just want one night where for 3-6 hours I can feel low. My whole childhood involved failing school, trouble, and consequent grounding, throwing out toys, no friends, basically a bed, clothes, and four walls, but I was never troubled by any of this, i would just find something like a rock or a stick and forget all about toys and everything else. I don't think I've ever fully appreciated the gravity of ANY situation.     Tl;dr Forever a jovial guy and I hate myself for it.
c788ed2bd8f26f96c57c09567ed60f329195ecf8cd254df15d3df5ab6138a5eb;;;Doctors thinks I have anxiety/depression but I think it's ADHD;;;So recently after seeing a general doctor several times, he diagnosed me with depression and/or anxiety. My initial reason to see the doctor was for ADHD, and in my observations, it seems all my symptoms mimic ADHD (inattentive type). I have done numerous online surveys, yet the doctor immediately (within a couple of minutes) ruled out ADHD. I'm currently on 5 mg of cipralex, for anxiety, depression and possibly OCD.  I think the real problem is inattentive ADHD, how can I make sure I'm not misdiagnosed?  Thanks in advance.
d553aa48b9c5603f2b7e243b25b1f3cf08da273abb6b9fd7b1e44df7b5430fff;;;Ladies of r/ADHD, did amphetamines cause you to have breakthrough bleeding?;;;**Back story:**I've been on my BC pill for years now, so my period has been super regular for a LONG time. However, the last couple of months I had to take two sets of antibiotics which makes the pill not work as well, if at all. So we used condoms that entire time (latex-free, so the fit is not *quite* as good as latex but it is as good as we can get). I haven't taken antibiotics since well before my last period.  I have been on dextroamphetamine for about a month or so now. Had my normal period, and am now having a second round of spotting almost 2 weeks after my last period.  Not too heavy, but still enough to need pads.  I should add that I have also not been anxious or stressed lately, so that is not a factor.  Before anyone suggests it, I am seeing a doctor for my annual exam on Monday.  I just have problems with waiting (obviously).  Anyone experience something like this? There was a similar thread a long while ago, but did not get much response.  **TL;DR** Any ladies have breakthrough bleeding after starting amphetamines?
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Going without medication;;;I think we can all agree. ADHD sucks. And it sucks orders of magnitude more without medication. My problem is that medication is not an option for me at the present. I'm enlisting in the US Army as of next year, and medication is an absolute no-go with them (it makes sense and I can't blame them. Inconsistent behavior is the last thing you want when you're training people how to use automatic weapons).  I'm hoping that some people here may have gone through the same or similar circumstances, and that you might be able to offer me some advice on how to regulate myself, because honestly, after being on medication for years, I feel like I'm drowning.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Can I have a bit of support, and some perspective advice to help my husband be more mindful?;;;My husband is an only child, so were his parents, and he was sent to boarding schools. Consequently, a lot of his behaviours are conflated Only-Child/ ADD issues, exacerbated by having not been taught. Case in point, his dental hygiene is awful, because he was never really taught how to do it.   We hten have massive issues, because I really want to help him correct these mislearnings, but his adult male pride, ADHD-I, and self-oriented primary concern, mean that he gets very angry, leading to destructive hyperfocus. To stick with the teeth, I once mentioned he had missed a bit, so he ground the brush against his gums until they bled, "because I told him to".   He's also gone away for a weekend long party, and in packing, has left EVERYTHING out of it's places, EVERYWHERE. I had to remove dirty laundry and an empty laundry basket from our bed last night, so I could get to sleep.   How can I sustainably broach problems like this, without causing hostility, so that he can learn to take care of our family?   **TL:DR**- How do we redirect ADHD-I, Only Child Hyperfocus into a wider perspective, so I don't spend my life tidying up after my Husband or arguing about broken things?

I have what I believe to be very apparent symptoms (family is firmly against the idea of mental illness, if you're curious as to why I wasn't diagnosed as a child) and I'm at the limit of how much I can cope simply with lifestyle and habit changes. I can no longer bluff my way through classes and it's as though any control I try to assert on my life slips away.  Anyway, I'm not drug seeking, inasmuch as I don't intend on exaggerating or lying about my experience to get a diagnosis, but I know some doctor in memphis absolutely refuse to prescribe meds to adults on principle. I'm without insurance, so I can't afford to jump around from doctor to doctor til I find a good one, so I'm reaching out to the community on reddit: Anybody from the Memphis TN area know a psych or GP who is friendly and responsive to the (adult) ADHD community?  Also, as my first time going to a doctor like this, would speaking candidly about meds and the research I've done, or would that be considered drug seeking behavior?   TL;DR I'm looking for a good doc, hoping someone from the Memphis TN area can steer me in the right direction. Thanks guys, this community's been a great help for me :)
69991472fb3df2f476f3224fe4f1723f73046c9da4b40d97b20d9b8a52312fd1;;;Living with side effects of medication;;;What are some differences in your life on medication that you probably wouldn't have to deal with if you didn't need to be medicated?  For example, now that I'm medicated, I:  – Always carry a water bottle and make sure I refill it as soon as it's empty. I probably drink at least a gallon of water if I'm doing it right.  – Plan my meals nightly before bed so I can make sure I end up eating enough. Especially since I'm trying to bulk, I have to integrate meals into my daily schedule because my hunger cues are non-existent. I don't think I'll have a very hard time cutting :)  – Brush my teeth four times a day. Like my meals, this is scheduled throughout the day. I knew dry mouth was a side effect, but I did not expect the resultant ass-breath.  – Have become a habitual gum-chewer. I never chewed gum before my diagnosis, but again, ass-breath.  – Have learned what is and isn't appropriate to talk to strangers about. I was friendly before, but at this point, cranky folks better hope they don't encounter me at the bus stop. Nobody is immune to my extraversion.  – Struggle not to overshare. I don't want to be typecast as "ADHD guy" in my circles, and I definitely don't want people to start snooping about my prescriptions. But as far as I can tell, my ADHD is a huge part of the person I am and the person I will be until I die. I also don't want other undiagnosed people to suffer. I still haven't figured out if it's something I should hide or something I should share.  – Actually do the things I set out to do every day. Okay, so this isn't a side effect, but it totally makes the rest of it worth it :)  What changes have you made in your life to work with the side effects of your medications?

If I knew a better place to turn I would do so.   I have an appointment with a psychiatrist this week. This is the first time I've seen a psychiatrist for ADHD, despite it being an issue for my entire life. I'm going to provide some background information about myself and follow that up with some questions.   Background: I'm in my mid-20's. I was enrolled in a private school in 1st grade. I stayed there for 1 year, at the end of which the school told my parents they suspect I had a learning disability and said I would be better suited in a more structured environment, so I moved to public school. I did not improve at all in public school. I just got by, failed to receive an award from Bill Clinton(he gave them to ~50% of our class for being exemplary, but it hurt to see my friends receive it.)  In middle school I continued having horrible grades. A few of my teachers spoke with me privately and said I had great analytical skills but needed to apply myself. Others just gave me a C or D and assumed I was lazy. In high school I again scraped by. I was put into "organizational workshop" courses, but also recommended for a number of AP courses due to my scores on some types of tests. Still, no treatment.   Then, college came around. I flunked out of my first school, but still, my parents assumed I was lazy. I would get yelled at and insulted, but nothing was done to address the underlying issue. I graduated this past fall, despite beginning college in 2005. I failed many classes at a community college and then the 4-year university I attended.   At this point I should mention that my father is a physician. A patient had left some of their medication with him(concerta) bc it didn't agree with them. I decided to try it out. It seemed to help a lot. I managed to convince my father to obtain a prescription for concerta for me to help finish school. The prescription wasn't in my name, so there is no record of it. What I found was, however, that concerta did not work. It relaxed my mind but it did not seem to have the desired effect. I ended up not taking it. I did manage to obtain some adderall, and this worked wonders for me. I had enough to last me 6 months. I took a consistent dose and it felt much more natural to me. Unfortunately, this was bought from a friend so is not documented. This brings us to today. I am starting a new job soon(and I'm excited about it!) but without adderall I know that things are unlikely to work out. I've gone to great lengths to modify my behaviors and put medication behind me, but it seems to be what holds everything together for me. I have an appointment this week with a psychiatrist, but i have no idea what to say.   **Questions**  Can I tell him that concerta doesn't agree with me? That I prefer adderall? I don't want to come across as a substance abuser, but there are no medical records to support that I've taken these medications.   Sorry for the length. I left out a lot of details out of consideration for your eyes. :)  Tl;DR: Undiagnosed ADHD, seeing psychiatrist, but not sure if I can mention that I've experimented with ADD meds and have an idea of what works for me.
eacf8bec8c7a536e84e413a08a560649226e00f1d0291a81fdcf2e9f5d7ad0cd;;;Recently diagnosed with Unspecified ADHD after having a neuropsychological evaluation. Unsure how to handle this. (20, M);;;Some background, and I'm sorry for the wall of text.  I have a history of seizures that caused spells of aphasia (loss of ability to understand or express speech). This was caused by an undiagnosed brain tumor encapsulated by a cyst that pressed on my brain as it grew, causing the seizures. It was removed in 2009 (9th grade), but I had a major seizure (catatonic for several hours) eight days after the surgery. It took a while to get back to normal, but I continued school as normal.   I had a neuropsych eval in the January 2010. Results showed "significantly impaired sustained attention" and "slight weakness in performing math problems and in overall math performance." Counseling, school accommodations, regular sleep, and gathering information needed to develop a strategic plan for my future were recommendations post the evaluation. None of this happened.  I recently had a neuropsych eval because I brought up some things that had seemed normal for me all through high-school and college (falling asleep in class, daydreaming, inability to focus on more than one thing or activity at a time) after basically failing out of college this January.   I went back to the neuropsychologist Tuesday to go over the results. After the battery of tests, I have "unspecified ADHD." I was in denial/shock for a few days, but decided to come here and read some of the posts. It all fits.  Help? I'm supposed to go to a psychiatrist and talk to my neurologist about this, but I'd just like to hear from the community what this means or what I can do. How do I deal with this? It was always just, "Oh, that's TheGrimHero, he's just like that." It was normal.  :(

I just started ritalin last weekish sometime. Wow, such focus. But seriously though, it's been incredible. I got to a place called the Affinity center in Cincinnati. They've taken EXCELLENT care of me. I meet with my therapist once a week, who talks to the doctor there once a week. I see the same doctor every 3-4 weeks. My overall ritalin experience has been eye opening.  So 20mg ritalin, and I'm prescribed it 3 times a day. So in one day I take 60mg. I typically save my questions for the doctor, but sometimes I feel like I'm being withheld information. Not on purpose mind you, I just feel like maybe I'm not getting the whole story. Since January I've been taking zoloft and mirtazapine. Antidepressant/ sleep aid.   Is there anyone else who has taken/ has concerns about any of these three medicines? 1. Mirtazapine 2. Zoloft and 3. Ritalin. Mainly ritalin.  My question is mainly this: what are some risks I may not know about? I mean when I go to the affinity center, the doctor takes my blood pressure and weight then basis everything off of that and how I feel. Am I not asking enough questions? Should I be concerned?  The ritalin for example. To be honest, I don't know many risks that come with it. This is mainly a feedback post, so I'm just looking for support, opinions, and feedback. What are some things that I may not know about any of this?   Tl;dr: 21 yo male w/ questions about meds. search for the question marks. just looking for feedback and support. I talk to my doctor this wednesday, so I will be bringing up anything that may seem super helpful here. thx everyone, i really appreciate it.

I totally get that. But I'm here to tell you that it won't always be that way and it's definitely possible to be successful!  I was diagnosed in 7th grade during a time when I couldn't write a complete sentence, do basic algebra, or read at my grade level (I was about 4 grade levels behind). Kids in my language class would laugh at me because they'd breeze through exams while I'd sit there and drop tears of frustration on my paper. I'd cry myself to sleep at night because I had gotten yelled at for something that my ADHD had kept me from seeing about myself. I had to work twice as hard to study in high school; twice as hard for half the grade my peers got at half the effort.   It continued into college. I worked my ass off to get Bs but over time, I got better. I worked hard on my writing. I read all the time to increase my literacy skills. I welcomed criticism so I can learn from it. It wasn't easy and you know what?? It's still not easy. But it got better.   After college, I went to graduate school. I got through but not without difficulty. A whole new set of problems awaited me at almost every turn. Abstract thinking, working in teams, and communicating was a challenge for me, but over time, I adapted and graduated.   I became a teacher after graduation. I loved being a teacher. Again though, it didn't come without challenges, Getting side tracked in class by students, forgetting small details when grading or talking to parents or my boss bit me in the ass from time to time. It was tough, but totally worth it; teaching is wonderful.   I went back to graduate school after teaching for a few years. It was great; I was a much stronger student and for the first time ever, students came to ME for help with papers and I soon became one of the class leaders in helping other students with graduate work and tutoring. But ADHD's ugly head wasn't far behind. Frustrated professors would often call me out for looking like I wasn't paying attention in class. I would say things that were out of context that would get me weird looks. Eventually, I was put on probation because of a huge misunderstanding regarding breach of conduct and plagiarism. I hadn't done anything wrong and most people knew that, but from the way the situation looked on the outside, the process dragged out for months. I eventually was exonerated and I graduated, but not without burning bridges. At this point in my life, I could have blamed the ADHD. But at the same time, I began to recognize that I was unconsciously using ADHD as a crutch; I was the only one holding myself back from further success because I continued to look at ADHD and either say I had overcome it, or that was the cause of my many idiosyncrasies. It was time for another evaluation.   I started seeing a therapist. My medications were adjusted (Straterra is awesome when used correctly). Meanwhile, I went back to teaching. Something was different though this time. After months of therapy and medication regulation, I was a completely different person. I recognized many other issues within me through therapy that I began to work on and adjust to. I came out of the closet to my family and friends (who welcomed me with a kind of love that I had never known before). I began to be more honest with myself. I stopped enabling my ADHD by not giving it anymore attention than it needed. I began to live more happily.   Two weeks ago I turned down acceptance to a PhD program at an IVY league school to accept a spot at a school that will fund me for four years. To go from someone who couldn't even read or write well in the 7th grade, to turning down a PhD program at a  top ten is a testament to years of hard work, tears, frustration, and acceptance. But it's been worth it to get to where I am now.   And ya know what? It's still a struggle. It always will be. ADHD will continue to put challenges in front of me that I will always have to work on. But that's life and I'm okay with that. It's never going to go away, but that doesn't mean it's going to dictate my life to me, not anymore, not ever again.   With all that said, in the words of Winston Churchill (who also had a learning disability) never, never, never give up!!! With hard work and determination, it will get better!

It helps immensely in my ability to focus and deal with anxieties, negative thoughts, etc. Now my question is can you beat adhd by being completely present? I'm very into spirituality and being present in the moment. Understand the feeling of being fully conscious, etc. however despite this I still find it incredibly difficult sans adderall. Its like I know what I'm supposed to do but my brain wont allow it. I dont necessarily fully understand how adhd works in the brain, is it just possible that we are not biologically able to be "present?"
c06f20ce066a741a8bd4de38e3231e1ff692c38af44a6f03260b1139c9e70d69;;;Motivation issues?;;;Hello, everybody. I am a 17 year old, currently in my junior year of high school, and have recently noticed that things have just.. well.. gone down hill.  I have struggled with school and other academic programs for most of my life, and was diagnosed with ADHD some time around seventh grade. I was put on medication (focalin XR being the first) and then, over the years, was changed to different prescriptions, such as Adderal, Adderal XR, and vyvanse being the most recent. During these few years, although I was not doing perfectly, everything seemed to be going okay, besides the occasional homework struggle, or failed test.  A few months ago, I decided that I was just going to stop taking my meds, and so I did. I was simply sick of the terrible side effects it gave me, and I was very confident that I could do without them. For a while, I felt extremely confident, and everything was great, until a few moths in when I noticed something. My grades and my work performance were slowly declining, and I noticed that I was becoming less and less motivated to do ANYTHING related to school.   Now, a few months later, I have almost completely given up on school. I have a very hard time getting myself to do any work, and the only thing I do at school is just show up. I have tried and tried but there is just nothing that can seem to get me motivated. So this brings me to my question, reddit; How do you motivate yourself, and/or stay motivated?   I would love to hear some feedback and tips from you guys, and I appreciate if you took some time to read this.  TL;DR - Stopped taking meds, everything was going fine, now it's falling apart.
26c8d9d2b31fc64dc9005a80d2688ba59d775ed810fdde86b86a578065120515;;;Addressing problematic ADHD social behaviors via coaching;;;Students come to the EDGE Foundation generally because they are struggling to get through college or on academic probation. Our first task as coaches is always to help them develop the organizational skills that will help them to remember to get to class, get a term paper written, and in short, get passing grades.  But while helping a young person keep their current job as student is critical, as coaches we also have a responsibility to help them develop the skills they will need for their future jobs in whatever profession they choose. Many, if not most of those skills are social rather than cognitive. Working in teams, working with customers, managers and staff, all of these typical work activities require social skills that many ADHD individuals do not come by easily.  Limitations in executive functioning often mean poor emotional regulation and limited ability to detect social cues that are essential for regulating and modifying behavior to fit the environment. A tendency to turn conversations into speeches, to step on other peoples words, and to miss or misinterpret the social cues all around them are typical ADHD social behaviors. These behaviors often result in the ADHD person having few friends and negative experiences being with other people in social settings. By the time an ADHD individual gets to college they are carrying not only the challenges of their ADHD but also the challenges of poor social skills and a negative psychological mindset built over years of failure and rejection.  The coaching laboratory As a coach, I pay a great deal of attention not only to what my young clients are saying about their academic efforts but equally how they are saying it. I pay attention to how long they speak without pause, how they answer emails and texts and how much they interact with me as a person. As we progress in the coaching relationship I encourage my young clients to use the coaching call as a laboratory to experiment with improved communication techniques.  As an example, we will pick a skill such as not interrupting each other while we are speaking. Then, during the coaching call I will gently call out the times when my young client interrupts. Between coaching calls I will encourage the young client to practice this skill in social settings. In the case of not interrupting others I might have her put a finger on her lips during a conversation so that she can develop mindfulness of this skill. I might also have her do something like take a deep mindful breath before she says something. All of these activities are designed to break through a deeply ingrained and unconscious habit and replace it with a more socially acceptable behavior.  Practicing new social behaviors with your coach Over time, the coaching calls continue to be an opportunity to practice new social behaviors. The benefit for the young client is that they have the opportunity of having a positive social experience and a model for other successful social experiences. Success in the coaching call leads to confidence and success in social settings. The benefit for me as a coach is the opportunity to have a truly delightful conversation with an enormously bright and charming young adult as a whole person. Indeed, this is the reward that every ADHD coach looks for in their relationship with their client.

I'm incredibly optimistic but trying to temper my expectations. So far (three days in) adderall has helped me:  Prioritize. The jumbled cloud in my head sort of settles into steps and tasks and I can actually act on the myriad of stuff my life requires.   Keep track of things. My wallet, phone, keys... Was always an endless search to get my shit together, now I'm more mindful of what I do with my things so that they're in the proper place when I need them.   Not feel so overwhelmed. I have a loooong way to go to get the pieces of my tornado life cleaned up, but I feel pretty accepting of the journey ahead, and it feels manageable.   Fuck yeah science. How have your meds helped you?

I don't know what to do;;;I am a freshman in high school and just this last year,  I was diagnosed with ADHD. Although my parents realize that I have it,  they don't realize how hard schoolwork is for me.  Every time I'm I have a hard time staying focused to do homework,  they always get extremely mad. If I tell them that just simply can't focus because of my Adhd,  they get even more mad and tell me to stop using It as an excuse.  I really need help managing my Adhd but my parents just think it is part of my personality and don't realize that it is a real disorder.  So my question is,  how can I convince my parents that Adhd is real and I need help to manage it?

I have lost alot of weight due to the side effects of the pill. I have also not been able to get to sleep and have very odd vivid dreams of shadow people. I'm only 15 and i wanted to see if i would be eligible for a green card in Arizona, my mom is very worried about my weight loss and trouble sleeping. I cant think of other options beside mmj. Im talking about the use if mmj for my side effects (Not sleeping/eating) not for my ADHD.
1b8e0d07b647b6adc0dbabd825b7f25690b9be439785a760f8a6b3c0a3e8d4ec;;;I need help. Feeling hopeless (30, F, UK);;;I am having a really bad time right now. I have been referred for ADHD diagnosis but the waiting list is apparently 10-11 months long. I don't know if I can wait that long and going private is out of the question.  I am agitated, unable to focus on anything and everything seems too overwhelming. Even things that are completely unrelated to me or my responsibilities can make me feel overwhelmed. For example I see a beautiful piece of art that has clearly taken somebody a long time to make. Instead of being able to appreciate the meaning and the craftsmanship behind it, I just feel a sense of dread at the impossibility of me being able to focus enough to create something anywhere near that. I am a creative person and so this is very frustrating. I have no job and am on sickness benefit at the moment and I feel like I am wasting my life.   I am barely eating and have persistent, intrusive thoughts of harming myself. In order to block these feelings out/feel less awful, I self medicate with alcohol, weed and prescription drugs, or failing that I just sleep for 12, 24, 36 hours at a time. I can't deal with this any longer. I was seeing a therapist but the organisation discharged me once they heard I was referred for ADHD assessment. I have been referred to a new therapist at my GP surgery but it is called "low intensity" therapy and I already don't think it will help me, as my feelings are most definitely high intensity.   Please can anyone offer advice? The past few days I have had several moments when I have considered presenting at A&amp;E (ER) and telling them I am having thoughts of suicide. If I do this, do you think I might be referred to a psychiatrist who can diagnose ADHD and get me the help I need (i.e. medication, perhaps more specific therapy)? Or would I just be told to sit it out on the waiting list like everybody else? I don't know what the protocol would be and I feel like this would be somehow disingenuous of me to do but then again I AM having suicidal thoughts and I DO desperately need help.   Thanks in advance.

[Long];;;I'm 20 years old and have had symptoms of ADHD my entire life. Like everyone always says, I've always been viewed as lazy, uninterested, forgetful, rude...etc. It wasn't until recently that I was formally diagnosed/given a prescription for Adderall (which I've reacted terribly to and am never planning to take again).   My main issue is with my mother and my sister, because even though they have both been around me my entire life, nothing i can say or do will make them understand that I'm not just lazy or attention seeking or whatever. They insist that because  can focus on things like texting that I must be able to focus on everything, I just don't want to do it. I've tried to explain that texting doesn't take much concentration, but nothing I say matters. They always say things like "If you just turn your phone off, you won't be distracted. If you would make lists you wouldn't forget. If you get more sleep you won't daydream. You just don't want to do it." The list goes on and on and I've tried for years to explain why these things didn't work, even tough I've tried them all, but I never had a reason to back it up. Since I got a formal diagnosis, they are just as bad as ever. Now they accept that I have a disorder, but refuse to apply it to why I have problems with certain aspects of life. "Yeah, you have ADHD but that doesn't excuse your time management"  We have fought every day for the last week. On top of having a horrible reaction to the Adderall (which I've stopped taking) I also haven't been getting any sleep (probably also adderall) and I'm just at my wits end. I try to talk to them, but they just shut me out. They say they don't want to hear any more of my "rambling". My mom's favorite is to tell me: "If you don't stop acting like this no one will ever want to be around you." They also like to remind me how this is *SO* much harder on them because they have to listen to me all the time.   I don't have anybody else to talk to. I don't like talking to my friends about these things because I feel like it's too personal, but I can't talk to my family either. Only my dad will ever take even a small amount of time to listen to me but he gets fed up too. I understand their frustration, I truly do, because I am completely sick of having to deal with myself too. I know it's hard on them. What they don't understand is that we don't think the same way, so what works for them doesn't work for me. I don't want their advice or their opinions. I just want someone to listen to me and let me vent without reminding me how horrible I am to be around. I'm going to set up an appointment with my shrink and my mother. Hopefully if she hears it from him she might finally understand, but until then I don't know what to do. It'll probably be more than three months from now.   Is there anything that I can do for now to help with this, aside from not talking about it? I try to avoid it, but they keep showing up with little pieces of advice that don't help. How does your family handle you and what do you do to get them to understand?  Thank you so much for reading this.   PS.  I only took the adderall twice, but both times the come up (?) made me extremely anxious, then I would feel stoned/giddy for a while, then the comedown makes me horribly, horrible depressed. Today once it wore off I spent two hours laying in bed crying and the rest of the night feeling too heavy to move. Is there any medicine out there that helps concentration but isn't so rough? This is the first time in a year I've finished all of my school assignments, but I'm not willing to trade grades for these side effects.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Psychiatrist insists I DON'T have ADHD.;;; I had been seeing a pretty nice psychologist for about an year who had been helping me cope with my ADHD and social anxiety (without meds). At some point, the anxiety completely spiraled out of control and he referred me to a psychiatrist. After the first visit, she said she was convinced what I was dealing with was purely anxiety and she put me on fluoxetine 20mgs. She soon increased my dosage to 40mgs and we've sustained that for the past 5 months.  The anxiety *melted* away, it was unbelievable! I could hold my own in conversations without second and third guessing myself. Wasn't frightened on the inside at work all day, which reflected dramatically on my productivity and was just an all around Godsend. After a while, I hit a plateau. I wasn't perpetually nervous/anxious anymore, but I still wasn't optimally productive. I'd still while away hours and hours on my computer with up to 60 tabs open at a time, still put away tasks till I got indirectly threathened with being fired at work, still procrastinate, procrastinate, procrastinate and still have issues with prioritising tasks (my direct supervisor's bane, he gets mad about how I turn in completed work that's low-priority, and voluntarily take on new projects, when projects that are MUCH more pressing are pending) and all these other issues that have been manifesting in different ways, for as long as I can remember.   Now, my psychiatrist has been reluctant to prescribe any meds because she is convinced I don't have ADHD, she feels ADHD is a 'fashionable diagnosis' for intellectuals, she is reluctant to prescribe Strattera because she says its a stimulant and is addictive (without Ritalin's bad 'side effects' which is why people always 'ask for it be prescribed') and pretty much would start shaking her head each time I mentioned my symptoms, like she didn't believe me. I've brought my ADHD up 3 times when getting my anxiety prescription refilled and, after the 2nd time, put it out of my mind and tried to act neurotypical for some months until I just... couldn't anymore and asked a third time on my most recent visit. She's still not convinced and won't budge an inch.   What should my next step be?

Set a doctors appointment, finish assignment, clean the kitchen...whatever YOU think is most important.)* * **Make a list** - Post a list of all the things you want to accomplish this week.  *(I highly recommend identifying the top 3 priorities.)* * **Feed your soul** - Sometimes by relaxing and having fun we have more energy to get more done. **List a couple FUN items to make your list more exciting.**  **Need/Want to copy last week's list *verbatim*?  Absolutely DO SO!**  *Those might be your keystone habits. Once you start doing those regularly you are able to do more. soon they will be automatic and you can put your focus elsewhere.*  *** By sharing our goal(s) with this understanding community, we can keep each other **accountable**...and **celebrate our successes**, large or small!  **Don’t forget to return for [Win Wedenesday] to flaunt your successes!**  ;-)  By getting one small task done it creates **momentum**, **trust** in yourself, **confidence**, and you will feel like doing more.  *** ## Suggested Guidelines * **Prioritize your list.** One thing you want to get done (or start). What is the most important thing for you? (If making a list works best for you feel free to do that too!) * **Add a finish OR start deadline.** By committing to a date/time, we can check on your progress. * **Edit your comment when done.** - Come back and edit your comment when you have finished your goal. We can celebrate that (and then people won't check on you). * **Small start.** - Share what SMALL (under 10 minutes) commitment you can make towards your goal.  *I found when my clients didn’t reach their goals 90% of the time they never started...this will help you break through the initial barrier.*  *** ## Tips * Your tasks/goals should ideally be S.M.A.R.T goals: **Specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound** * **Measurable** - Make sure you can be able to say YES I DID THIS. **Study enough** is not measurable.  Study 2 hours is. * **Break it down** - Instead of saying clean my room...it might help to say, “Clean room for 10 minutes or pick up trash in room.” * **Write it down elsewhere** - Sticky note by computer.

Our working memories are flaky.... * **Start small...build up slowly** - We want to build on small successes so committing to cleaning your entire house might be a bit too much to handle.  Pick a room (or a task like ‘pick up dirty laundry’)  instead. * **Want to study for 2 hours a day?** *Commit to studying 30 minutes to make it easier on you.*  *** ## Examples from previous weeks: * Tidy room. * Buy car. * Go to work. * Attend all my classes on time. * Reschedule appointment. * Mornings: brush teeth &amp; meditate.  Evenings: brush teeth, meditate, journal. * Pay bills. * Plan vacation. * Go to the gym 3x this week. * Break down chores by days so I can have 'a day off with my darling' before he leaves. * **Start** *[something]*. “Spend 5 minutes on writing my paper.”  *** ## *It’s now easier to respond!

d5ef74ad14f7ab44cbddfde84bacf811234e78473e5a9cd2044c98e98cb86a74;;;Co-existing condition: Sensory processing disorder?;;;I was diagnosed with ADHD by a specialist 9 or 10 years ago and have been receiving medication treatment ever since (Adderall, Intuniv, and Celexa). However, I've had some other symptoms which don't seem to align with ADHD and I wanted to see if any other ADHD'ers experience them as well. They are a little difficult to describe but I'll try my best - to summarize, it's extremely difficult for me to ignore unpleasant physical sensations and I remember going through this since I was a kid. For example:   * Clothes tags drive me crazy! They feel scratchy against my skin, I frequently re-adjust my shirt to try and remove the sensation. I first remember this occurring when i was 9 or 10, I couldn't sleep all night once because the tag on my underwear suddenly felt so uncomfortable.  * Physical exertion is extremely unpleasant. I feel that I have a decent level of fitness, I can walk for relatively long distances without issue and lift a decent amount of weight. However, actually lifting the weight or doing things like push-ups or running is extremely uncomfortable. I don't get tired, it's like all of the unpleasant body feedback (e.g. burning muscles) jump to the front of my mind and can't be ignored. What's interesting is that this feeling occasionally disappears and some medications help reduce the symptoms (e.g. Trileptal, Abilify)  * I love being cold and hate being hot. Being hot drives me crazy, I think because I start to sweat and I can't ignore how uncomfortable the feeling of wet sweat in my clothes makes me feel.   My psychiatrist said that this sounds like something called Sensory Processing Disorder (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_processing_disorder) which commonly co-exists with ADHD. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? If so, what have you done to treat it?

I'm called for a job interview soon (system install engineer if it matters) and I'm pretty sure that at one point they will ask me why I took an extra year.   Would it be smart to mention my ADHD? I know it's a double edged sword but now that I've found working meds I can feel everything is going a lot better and I'm hopeful for the future. But I'm still afraid that just mentioning it and using it as an excuse will be enough for me to get rejected.

I've probably asked this a lot, but I made a text post for visibility, rather than a comment.   I've tried **Wellbutrin100**, **Strattera20**, **Concerta36**, and **adderall10** (all generic), with no success in keeping me focused, removing the fog, or memory retention.  My pdoc said Adderall was the last drug we could try, and it's given me some dismal results. What other medications are available?  Is there really a difference between medications that have the same formula? E.g. Vyvanse, concerta, Ritalin

I was sent forms for myself, my girlfriend and my parents to complete, which I sent back.  I just got a letter stating that on the 8th of April I am to go for a 2.5 hour meeting, but I am able to bring someone with me.  I am hoping to bring my girlfriend, but don't know why. What do you think this meeting will be about/what will happen (2 and a half hours is a REALLY long time.....)  TL;DR Have a 2.5 hour meeting with an Adult ADHD specialist - what to expect? Should I bring someone?

It might as well be titled "How to Manage Your ADHD Employee".   Wonderful article.   By the way, do we have any other reADHDitors who are in HR?   p.s. Do people here say reADHDitors?

However im still trying to find mine on average I have 2-3 jobs a year prior to working with verizon wireless a personal best 37 months. Till some bad directions got me in trouble. Manager told us to do something and my hyperfocus took it and blew it up to proportions they couldnt see coming. 20-50 line deals. Anyway my question comes with the computer science people in mind. I cant do monotony but everybody says it woeks well for them. Ive tried learning a programming language but I get a few chapters in and it get boring. Do you find these things monotonus and how do you cope... also with regards to a precios post abouy information overload where I learn everything I can about a subject as fast as I can. Once I become, in my head an "expert" I get bored with said subject really quick. I.e. I started back to school for building construction and now im getting bored with the classes because of my absorption of information leaving me "knowing it" any ideas to help would be great. My next endeavor is joinging the navy which was always a dream of mine growing up from age 7 till I broke my ankle senior year of high school and killed my enlistment options at the time. I have no formal diagnosis of my adhd and going into the military im not going to get it. Ill just learn to cope with my issues one day at a time.  Tl; dr cant stand monotony in my jobs. Get bored with subjects quick. Thinking following my dreams of enlisting in the navy might be my best choice.  Thanks

I have been diagnosed with ADHD since the age of 12 and have been medicated since. I started my undergrad in 2007 and abruptly stopped in 2010 as a result of an existential criss. I resumed in 2011, and have not been able to penetrate above a 78 mark. I work my ass off, and still don't do well.  Today, broke my resilience towards these marks. I got a 63 on a paper I worked my ass off on, and felt confident towards. I do poorly whether I take my medication or not.  I'm so sick of it all I want to do is cry but i'm in a class right now. I'm finished my undergrad finally in December. I just want to drop out again. This is no use for my future, this is just destroying my self esteem. I want to excel at something. My best friend is in law school, she is getting straight A's while I study the same time as her and get C+s - B-'s. I can't handle this anymore. There is no winning. What is the point of my medication, it's making me dull and I never want to see my friends. My therapist has done jack shit for my condition, healthy eating doesn't help, I just want a solution and finish school.  :(
f878232489571c3ef030159aba77147b24cd18b9cf57643cb3ae133c8aa6fc08;;;Career issues;;;   So I work for a package delivery company and I recently got offered a chance to be a driver (well I applied a while ago but they just now got openings for drivers). This would make me a lot of money so I jumped on the offer. Usually the procedure is that you go to the driver class and if you pass, they move you to a part time or full time position based on need. Apparently, they changed the way they find candidates. This time me and the other applicants were given a page with driver safety stuff on it and told to study it and be able to recite certain parts verbatim. If we couldn't pass a test on it by Friday (of last week), we couldn't even take the course.          I didn't study.           I've never been able to even review material unless I have actually been taught it either through a discussion, an in-depth lecture with notes (possibly my least favorite way but it helps), or even a video. I ended up telling my supervisor that I didn't study so taking the test would have yielded little to nothing. I'll post more info on what exactly I said in a comment, but the important thing is that I didn't mention having ADHD. I know I most likely should have, but I hate the idea of using it as an excuse. Also, I believe that if they have to make concessions for me, they would have to do the same for the other employees and I don't know exactly how to feel about that. I am fairly sure I have totally missed my chance and it's killing me.          Today, when asked about the driver test, I found myself frequently having to tell people that I have ADHD. I'm afraid now of appearing to be a weak person who only seeks an excuse.          My issues now are:      * Was not mentioning my ADHD a major mistake?  * Why did I avoid telling my supervisor this and then just spread the info at the slightest prompting?    * Was this an example of the company being unfair or me looking for reasons to not study? Was I just feeling lazy or entitled? Am I using my ADHD as a crutch?    * How can I live with this when I can't even study one page of information (half of which I knew from my current position)?         tl;dr: Had to study small amount of info for test to further career. Didn't. Offered no information to supervisor regarding ADHD, but told everyone else.
a011c3779e0fadb0ad7ec806fff6eab26d1d52247e8207c5aadf2b03ec80936f;;;Paradox: I think I value impulsivity / distractibility / etc;;;I was diagnosed as an adult, pretty recently. And I've noticed that a lot of the material I've found about ADHD presumes that things like distractibility and disorganization and not giving consequences too much thought are mostly negative and that one must find strategies and medications to notably reduce these. But I feel ambivalent about this.  On one hand I can increasingly see that these aspects of ADHD help lead to unhelpful outcomes for me, like not being able to find the will to seek out a career or job that I would like better.  But at the same time I think I find satisfaction in being somewhat flighty, undisciplined, inefficient, nonlinear, and slightly immature for my age. It can be very positive impulsively mixing the theoretically more important and going off on random tangents; and you can even find some unexpectedly useful things that way. I'm tempted to see some of this as a positive aspect of who I am, even as it can be a bit absurd. Some of these ADHD things I think I might even want to put into a list of my core values.  Is this familiar to anyone? I'm not sure how to resolve the paradox of valuing aspects of myself that are also in some ways undermining myself. Regarding my own particular case, I have trouble seeing it entirely as a disorder that needs treatment, even though things seem clearly to not be going as well as I might hope.

Since self diagnosing, researching here, and eventually getting a real diagnosis which led to medication (which changed a few times) I am at a point in my life where I feel like my options are limitless.  It's been about 5 months but I have a renewed desire to learn and succeed. I went from doing very poorly at my job, unable to focus well even on my hobbies which interest me, and struggling to develop any other skill to being in line for a promotion, interviewing at a top 5 software engineering company for a dream position, and most importantly seeing me develop and learn skills every day. Most days I feel the same as I did when I saw the list of majors a college offered and thought omg I can do whatever I want.  Anyway just a random thanks post and to urge people to take control of the problems they have. Even if Meds aren't the answer for you, do it. On days when I don't take meds simply knowing my weak areas I am able to accomplish my goals better than prediagnosis. Cheers

Based on the quick 1 hour meeting, they believed I had GAD and suggested CBT and also switched me to another psych for this.  I'm still under the belief that I have ADHD and I haven't really seen any purpose to this CBT.  What I'm frustrated with is they changed my medication from Paxil to Wellbutrin.  This seems like they are treating ADHD with "might work" (NDRI) instead of diagnosing and treating with "might work with higher success rate" (Stimulants)  If I do not have ADHD then I am fine, but I want my doctor to explain why she believes that.  Is there a series of tests that can definitively take ADHD off the table?  I've run the gambit of SSRIs and SNRIs and can't handle the try (for months) and see method anymore.  So has anyone else been in this position, and did they eventually move from GAD to ADHD?

Im so nervous..;;;im 27. mother has "type 6 ring of fire" adhd along with cousins and my 5 year old son. I got diagnosed with adhd when I was 8 but my mom being who she is and going unmedicated herself, I went on with zero treatment. I ended up pregnant at 17 and failed school (I graduated but just barely). I didnt start really researching or caring about it until this past year. Im terrified of being diagnosed though I know I need this. Im terrified of talking to a stranger about how much Im a failure.  Im terrified of being on any kind of mind altering drug although I smoke weed. Im just terrified with no valid reason to be. What do I say to her? Is it just q&amp;a? Will I be diagnosed right away or does it take multiple sessions? I have major social anxieties so the thought of sitting there with a stranger alone can make me pee a little. Tell me ill be fine.. please?

We talked about my suspicions that I have adhd as well as other potential cause of my symptoms (general anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, among others). we talked about that for maybe 30 minutes, and then he moved strait to medications, and wrote me perceptions for lamictal and adderall. I have not yet been diagnosed with anything, is this sort of thing common practice, or should it be cause for concern? The doc was Dr. Sang Suh so if anyone has experience with him and would care to share their experience with him that'd be great too!
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Recently diagnosed with ADHD. Tips?;;;I was diagnosed with ADHD about 4 months ago. I am a freshman in college, so it was a pretty late diagnosis. I've always done extremely well on standardized tests, ACT, etc. I scored a 30 on the ACT without even knowing about my ADHD. However, I have always had really bad grades in school. I graduated high school with under a 2.5 gpa. Probably closer to 2 if I'm honest with myself. I'm on aderall but I had to switch psychiatrists so I have been on 10mg for awhile. I dont think it even helps anymore. I was hoping that the diagnosis would help me out a bit. It hasn't changed anything. I still miss appointments and meetings. I still barely get by or just fail classes. I still feel like a piece of shit. I don't understand how people can do well in school with ADHD. Sorry for the rant, back to the point. Does anyone have any tips for me to start doing well in my classes? At this point, I would be happy if I just don't fail out of school after this semester. Thanks for reading!

I moved hundreds of miles away, have almost no money, and moved in with my parents. I've got jobs I need to complete, but can't. I can't focus, I can't finish anything, and I'm fucking tired of it. I can't get enough money to afford insurance until I complete these jobs, but I've spent months avoiding doing any actual work.   Who do I talk to? The Psychiatrists I called charge in the 250 dollars an hour range, and I've never worked with them, is it likely they would tell me 5 more sessions and maybe you'll get what you need?   I'm in LA, does anyone know of anyone with a sliding scale? Someone who I can afford to go to, and will make sure to look at my medical history when deciding to fill a subscription, so I can finally finish what I need to do to get my life back on track.   Anything would be helpful.

dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;So, I'm consistently failing to turn in work on time/at all, and I feel stuck (Warning: wall of text);;;Fourth semester of College. Each semester, my GPA drops. I'd always planned on getting into grad school, but at this point I don't think that's ever going to happen, because I can't even make up my mind on what to major in and my family is running out of money and even if I COULD afford more college my GPA is so bad I can't think of a grad school that would take me. And because I keep doing poorly, each semester i take on a lighter courseload, and tell my parents I'll get a job, and they tell me not to so I can focus on my studies, and then I try and explain that it's not that I don't have TIME to study, it's that I don't use my time well, so getting a job won't change anything, but I don't think they get what I'm saying.  Anyway, this semester I'm only taking 3 classes. Biology (the supposedly hardest class), the lab that goes with it, the discussion section (which is a separate class, for some reason), organic chemistry lab (I dropped it last semester), and a humanities credit.   Earlier this semester, I fucked up in Orgo Lab for a while, and for about 3 weeks I just DIDN'T do the lab reports. At all. I put them off too much and tried to start them 20 minutes before lab, which obviously didn't pan out, since it takes me 30 minutes to get into the focusing zone. One of them I had LITERALLY already done last semester, before I dropped the class. I already knew the correct answers. It was a free 20 points. Didn't do it. But I got that pretty much under control now.  In my Bio Lab, we had to run a lab report. It was a big thing, 10 pages or so, so we got REPEATED reminders every lab for 3 weeks leading up to it. I started at 6 pm the night before, when the lab starts at 8 am. I didn't even get past methodology. I meant to finish it right after lab ended, and then email it to the TA, but I didn't. It's been almost a week now. I haven't touched it.  I'm failing ethnomusicology. There's only 2 graded assignments: both essays. The first one, I had to interview a friend about a band he likes, and write a 2 page paper about his identity within that musical subculture. Pulled an all-nighter, got almost nothing done, skipped discussion (where I would have handed it in) partially out of shame, and partially because I have chem lab the same day and I NEED to sleep if I'm gonna be handling hazardous chemicals. That was for the rough draft. Next week, same thing happened with the final draft. Week after that, I found out that the absolute deadline was 11:59 pm that sunday night. I MEANT to start chipping away at 12 pm. But that turned to 2 pm, which turned to 4 pm, which turned to 6 pm, when I actually started. At 9 my roommate walked in to see how I was doing. I had read through 3 articles looking for sources, found them all irrelevant, and written absolutely nothing. The article I was reading when he walked in wasn't even related to my paper, and I knew it. I just couldn't stop reading it, and I felt overwhelmed because I couldn't figure out how to organize my paper. So he sat with me and helped me sketch out a rough outline in a few minutes, then literally forced me to keep writing for 3 hours straight. By 11:59, I had a paper that was garbled and disorganized, without proper citations, and only half the required length. I emailed it (to the wrong TA), saying that I'd email the rest by 1 am. I was actually so stressed out from having to write so much without being able to rewrite or rearrange that I was physically trembling. It took me until 1 am just to calm down. I got a thing back from the TA, saying that a deadline is a deadline, so it's a 0.  Today is the due date for my final paper. We had to go to a concert/performance, and then write about how the artist expresses their identity in their performance. We've known about it literally all semester. The teacher has been repeatedly telling us to go to a concert BEFORE April, so that we'll have plenty of time for the essay. So what did I do? I put off picking a concert until this past week, by which point my only option was one on Saturday, leaving me Sunday to write a 7 page paper. Last day for dropping a class was last Monday. That's actually when I finally talked to my TA about the trouble I was having with the assignments, because I wasn't sure I could do the final essay and I was thinking of dropping the class. She told me that there's nothing I could do about the first essay, because I'm only bringing it up now, a month after it was due, and I was just gonna have to power through on Sunday. I honestly didn't think it would work out, because I have a history of not being able to do what she was telling me to do, but I didn't know how to explain it to her without sounding whiny or getting emotional, so I just left. Besides, I'm taking so few classes this semester that I'm part time, where you pay by the credit, so if I dropped the class I'd have wasted 2,000 dollars.It's 7 am on Monday morning, I just finished pulling an all-nighter. Wanna guess whether I finished the paper? Hint: I wrote 1/2 a page, double spaced.  I don't know what to do. Part of me wishes I could ask for an extension or something, but there's no good reason for that. I did this to myself. And if I DID get an extension, all that would happen is that I'd procrastinate until the night before the NEW deadline. I don't want to get excused for this, I want this to stop happening. But I don't think it ever will. I've been trying to get better about this for years, and it's only gotten worse. I'm on meds. They help with a lot of things, I don't fall asleep from holding still for more than 15 minutes anymore, but I'm not sure if they're making this writing problem better or worse. And I don't even know if the problem is the ADHD or just me being lazy, or something else.  Part of me knows that I should have asked the TA or the teacher for more help, but I always procrastinate on these things so badly that I can't talk to them. And besides, every time I've tried to ask for help from a teacher, or my schools' learning assistance center, or the writing center, it does jack shit. Besides, I don't like asking teachers for help. They always tell me that I'm clearly smart, the assignment isn't that hard, I'll be fine. I don't know how to make them understand that what's easy for most people isn't easy for me. I can do calculus easily. I slept through most of Calc 3, never read the textbook, never did practice problems, studied for 2 hours before the final exam and got one of the only A's. But planning out which concert to go to, and when, and how to get there, and then actually going? Asking someone if I can interview them, and planning out questions to ask, and writing it all down, and remembering what questions I was going to ask, and finding a way to ask them, and then remembering to write down all the answers? That's hard. That's really hard for me.  I'm technically registered with the DSS, but I never discussed it with my teachers. The lady at the front desk always tells me I've done SOMETHING wrong (forgot to bring my files, didn't set the appointment, came to the appointment on the wrong day). I mean, she's not mean about it, but she intimidates me. Besides, I can't think of anything I'd get out of accommodations. I don't want extended test time, or a private testing room, or a notetaker. And that's pretty much all they can give me.  I just don't know what to do. Part of me wants to use having ADHD to try and get an extension or exception and rescue my semester. Part of me wants to take the failure, and just keep going at it until I get it right. Part of me wants to not come back next semester, maybe ever.  Any advice? Sorry if this is all kinda jumbled. No sleep, remember?  TLDR: keep fucking up every time I have a written assignment. Screwing over my GPA, and I don't know how to handle the situation. Help?

My 10-year-old step-son was diagnosed with ADHD-Hyperactive about 4 months ago. He had gotten to the point where some would have labeled him ODD, refusing to go to school, arguing about everything, etc. (You could literally tell him the sky was blue, and he would pick a fight and argue about it).  He's since started taking Concerta, which has been remarkably successful for him. We've also adapted our parenting style (using the Love and Logic method), which has also helped a lot (we no longer argue, lecture or bark commands when he's acting up). Things have gotten much better.   But I wanted to ask you guys what do you wish your parents would have done (or maybe what they did do) that would have helped you be more successful at your life now?  My son is a smart kid, and I'd love to hear from others who've been there so he has the best chance at a great life later.

I have questions and would appreciate advice especially similar experiences.;;;Well I've been prescribed vyvanse for 3 years and I've improved so much. When I take vyvanse my focusing issues including hyper focusing go away, vyvanse  calms me down, I'm able to actually enjoy reading, have pushed myself really hard in school, have more enjoyable conversations with others, can visualize stuff in my mind, have a very positive mindset, actually chose a major and graduated college (this is after I changed my major like 7 times before meds and just got in and constantly got overwhelmed, I now have stable interests (I used to go from no interest, to hyper focusing on one thing, to wanting to focus on everything) retain information better (it used to vanish from my head before I could even write it on paper. Nowadays I feel so cool being able to remember stuff from class or appointments from memory) and I've  have achieved so much. It's all my own but what do meds actually do?  I realize it's all my work, but at the same time when I don't take my meds I still have the same focusing and working memory issues and it takes me like 4 hrs to get out of bed and shower, I have trouble reading, focusing, can't visualize stuff in my head, always lose stuff, and the usual. It's hard for me to understand the difference between my own work and what the medicine helps me with at times because with ADD if I didn't take my meds id be dealing with the same issues and it's so weird to just be able to learn, memorize stuff, and understand things so easily when I struggled so much in the past and even when I tried my hardest to retain information and succeed in school and  it just slipped out of my mind even though i was intelligent I still had these issues w/ ADD. It's not just no longer dealing with it it's not having to deal with the emotional stress associated with it. It's amazing but confusing. I asked my psychiatrist what meds do and he said they do a little but the majority of work is my own, and that the meds basically turn a switch on and things work the way they're supposed to. My self esteem has grown a lot and so as my confidence under treatment has increased a lot, but at the same time it's hard to downplay the positive influence meds have had on me. It's just really hard to figure things out like this for me at times and my biggest worry is for my doctor to one day take me off meds and see how much I've improved, but then w/o meds id lose the progress I've obtained and be stuck in a career unable to manage my responsibilities. My meds aren't an excuse for laziness or an escape from responsibility like that, but how can I recognize the positive effect meds have on me without downplaying my own work?  Ive yet to find a satisfactory way to explain this and would like to somehow to my shrink. But I cannot overstate how much my life has changed for the better with treatment for ADD. I really want to understand and define myself in a positive way that helps me grow.     I also have another question:   Is the whole ADHD/ADD going away in some people a misnomer because it seems really weird that it would suddenly vanish? My doctor mentioned that once but I don't get understand it at all. I've had the same working memory issues and focusing issues my whole life so I would be very shocked if they magically went away. Does it really go away in some people? What causes that?  Tl;dr: meds really help me and I'm able to overcome ADD, but where do I draw the line between what the meds do and my own work? I struggled so hard to be able to focus in the past and remember stuff and wasn't able to and now I can.

The first med I took was Ritalin which was tolerable in terms of side effects but it made me nervous and would make my social anxiety worse at times. The next med I tried was Adderall which I like better than Ritalin but It still brings on anxiety and plus it's almost impossible for me to sleep at night.  For the past 3 months I haven't touched stims at all and I am having trouble focusing in school. I'm thinking of trying out Dexedrine IR because it seems it doesn't bring on as much anxiety as other stims and sleep isn't as much as an issue.  What do you guys think about Adderall vs. Dexedrine?

Looking back at my life, I feel like I was much more on the PH side of things as a kid, with very little PI symptoms. Now as I've gotten older, my PH has almost all but faded away (except for fidgeting and talking excessively *^(although this is only when I'm drunk)*) and my PI symptoms seem to be getting worse. My short term memory is almost non-existent, my sense of time is horrible and everyday is an active battle to stay focused on the things I need to get done. Now I don't think I need my dosage increased, because I just had it bumped up back in January.  Is this a common thing as people with ADHD get older? I know PH usually starts to fade off as people get past puberty, but does PI get worse as the brain ages? If so, does doing mental exercises help to slow down the process?
953cfef57c2f40abf651d8c5adbeff28e6b8267a93fe7db8b8118ab64df6693a;;;Old patterns return. Feeling stuck and want to talk it out.;;;TL;DR Awesome job suddenly flipped to boring desk shackle in my mind.  How do I get what I want?  I'm a 40 y/o male.  As I start to write this out, it suddenly seems obvious that the #1 bad sign is that I don't feel I have anyone in real life I can talk to about this.  Rather, I am headed to a message board to do this anonymously.  So I guess I still have some shame issues to work through, and I guess my social network could use some shoring up.  With that...  I always want to quit my jobs sooner or later.  When I was married, this caused me great distress because, even with no kids, my wife could never support the two of us.  I got divorced, got a great job, and my new lifestyle let me spend a ton of time in the sun and fresh air guilt free.  I had a light heart about work, feeling I could leave whenever, which naturally made it easier for me to enjoy.  Fast forward.  Been seeing this girl for about two years, and though we live apart, it's totally clear where she wants it to head (move in together, eventually marriage), and when life is good, I'm fine with the moving in, and convincible about the marriage, someday, with a prenup.  And now, bam!, awesome job suddenly bores me to tears, and new manager/scrutiny is making it feel much more like a job than play.  :-(  My heart is telling me to leave this job, live outside (bike touring or similar), and return to the world of work only when I yearn for it.  (I did this successfully for a month last year.  Life was so simple.  I loved it.)  Fear is telling me that at my age, maybe the next awesome job won't be so easy to find.  And love has me paralyzed, because I really don't look forward to the heartache and hurt on both sides if/when I (a) become a different person [in her eyes], and (b) leave.  Have you been here?  Any guidance?

I am graduating late...  I am trying to get a regular honours degree (4 years).  I transferred to a university and in the 3 year program. The three year has less options for (grad school, professional school, government jobs).  I realized I have ADHD (diagnosed last Christmas) and was undergoing treatment for anxiety before.  I now take medication for ADHD sparingly.  I hate university.  I was pretty smart... at least I did well in school up until university. Some issues in grade 10, but resolved (with non IB courses) in the rest of high school.  I have changed my major, did not complete a lot of courses, petitioned for late removal of courses I did not complete, etc, etc.  I wanted to finish AT LEAST with a reasonable GPA.  Looking to be very hard to do.  I may just apply to graduate and be done with it, 4-5 courses shy of the honours degree. Even if I finished all those courses, I may be .2 off or so in terms of getting the four year degree.  Should I just bite the bullet and finish with what I can.  This is a really hard situation. My student dean said he has never seen a situation quite like mine (FML).   I am in Economics. I want to get into sales and pursue some creative interests as well as maybe, just maybe, some day get into law school. That seems quite a long shot, and may require a second undergrad/ lots of work experience to distance myself from undergrad.  Then again I suffered a lot in school.  I know I can stop putting some other very important goals on hold, if and only if I get out of school.  My school has screwed me over repeatedly. For instance my advisor told me to take one course to replace a failed course, that I retook and passed (but no credit was awarded), and it turned out that course DID NOT COUNT TOWARDS my program.  I then, was unable to take anymore courses till like 6 months later, due to finishing all the credits I needed as per transferring.  Any help?  I reluctantly take medictation: dexedrine. I took other stuff but it caused my hair to shed.  I have a psychologist and a psychiatrist (I only really see for medication and some letters here and there).  Are there options for a three year grad in Canada?  Can I upgrade my schooling down the line.  I am not unintelligent, but I am very bad at time management, I hyperfocus, get stuck in majors I am ill-equipped for.  I need to get better at math... but, likely won't until after school. Short of flying someone over here and having them teach me Economics from the ground up, I don't think I can ace 4-5 econ courses in a row.  Any advice is appreciated.  Thanks.   TL;DR: -I have had untreated ADHD for like 25 years.  -I got the diagnosis last year.  -I screwed up at my new school a few years ago. Did not complete courses.  -Got straight and resat all courses, and petitioned off many, increased my GPA.  -I do ok at times, but still mess up.  -I have doubts of being able to excel at 5 more courses or so in 4th year Economics....   I still don't understand a lot of things. I get it qualitatively especially some courses like finance courses,  but I get stuck on questions and have not found great tutoring. I can get questioned answered and practice from there sometimes, but it is often too little too late.   -I cannot afford to spend more time at school. It is killing me.  -I need to get out. And I want to on a HIGH note... showing improvement.  -I was considering taking some psychology courses in summer AND then applying to graduate with better grades.  -Are there options for a three-year bachelor's holder? To upgrade or to do technical school, in Canada. Thanks

(ADD);;;Know that feel when you NEVER follow in class? like out of 2 hours,you'll listen for 5 min max because your mind keeps wandering all the time  Go to the library without anything to distract you,after 3 hours you managed to read 2 pages (because you can't concentre, you keep thinking about unrelated **** mid reading so you have to start all over again 9237912743 times, even when you force yourself it doesnt get in)  When someone gives you instructions, you always had to ask them 28467826428 questions to get it while everyone else understood the instructions.  Cant count the number of times i asked questions retarded questions (because the teacher apparently kept explaining it over and over again in class) to a teacher because i couldnt listen during class (My physic 3 teacher and my calculus 2 teacher legit thought i was retarded or something)  Always have to ask team mates/class mates about what's going on, what to do, at a certain moment they get pissed and **** so many frustrating ****s  and when you talk about that to a family member/friend, he will say: ''that happens to everyone'' I'm sure it happens to everyone once in a while but not all the ****ing time, the only time i can actually work normally is when an exam is like 2-3 days away. I'll be able to concentrate  OR when people say ' ''ADD ISNT REAL, YOU JUST NEED SELF-DISCIPLINE DUHHH'', i knew i had problems concentrating and organizing for years,read alot of books,audio tapes on self discipline,tried my best at staying constant but i always ended up failing , it never worked more than a day and it never helped me to pay attention in class. I became awared about ADD like 4 months ago, i didn't know what it was before, just thought i had the ****test self discipline on earth. I still managed to have a 82% average in college despite all that (99% of my studying/paper writing was done 2-3 days before the dead line or the exam date)   Anyone knows that feel? and anyone got treated? The neuropsy wrote a report to my doc in the which she advices him to give me ''stratera'' which isnt a neurostimulant unlike aderall and ****. It takes weeks for you to see the effects, did it work for anyone? Ive seen reviews about medication online, some say it was a life saver,made them go from 2.5 gpa to 4.0 gpa,they became very organized. Others felt empty inside/depressed

Time to move forward.;;;So i decided to get tested for ADHD about a month ago as i was struggling in school and in general life itself. I set up an appointment for the psychiatrist and kicked things off. In his opinion from talking to me and watching me he agreed that it was a high probability that i had ADHD. He referred me to a psychologist for additional testing.   After meeting with my psychologist we decided that four hours of testing is the path we would take. The first test would be an IQ test and the second was what he called and achievement test. I ended up doing two, two hour, segments.  Today we met and i got the results of said tests. I cant says im too shocked by the ADHD part, although it was different then i originally thought. Ill list everything out below and try to get things right or as close to how he explained.  **IQ RESULTS**  * FSIQ = 116(High end of high average)- This was actually quite a shock.  **ACHIEVEMENT RESULTS**  * Reading-106  * Writing-105  * Mathematics-92(May be considered a learning disability but might not)  There was a lot of numbers thrown at me so i probably missed a lot to add into this.  He official diagnosis was that i have a severe ADHD-Pi issue. He through some numbers at me like 12.66 and then 6 and said something about being over double. I wish i would have gotten more info but maybe some of you amazing folks here could help me understand more as i only had an hour with him.  We meet again on Wednesday to discuss medication and schooling an all of that.

c1c2b2223e4a8a126cc00bf83577611b9cf3fbeafc9fe04d9e854a57729f2cde;;;None of the stimulants work.;;;I'm 21 years old and was diagnosed with ADHD a month ago.  I've known I've had it my whole life but the nurse practitioner brought it up and recommended I get tested, so I did.  After I got diagnosed, I was prescribed Ritalin. Ritalin made me very sleepy, no focus, headaches, irritable, and depressed after it wore off.  I went back to the person and she prescribed me focalin and adderall generic (sand). She wanted me to try the focalin hoping it would work since she doesn't view adderall as the best substance. I agree with her.  I try focalin and the same thing happens.  I then try adderall and something fantastic happened. I sat still in class and focused the whole time. I had never experienced this before.  Next day comes, hoping for the same thing and it didn't do anything at all.  A week later, I tell her what happened and she upped my dose. She wrote another script for generic adderall 20 mg (teva).  So I first tried the new dosage with the sand generic and had about 25mg in my system. Same thing happens as the first time. Laser focus and sat relatively still. Not as focused as the first time.  I then tried the 20mg teva and all that happened was it made my body tingly.  It made me relaxed but I was still on the edge. I didn't notice anything at all. Still jumping from task to task, forgetting minor things then remembering them later. Attempting to clean my room and somehow end up buffing the entire dining room floor.  I was hoping it would help me with slowing down my body and keeping my mind on the task at hand rather than thinking about 20 different things at once. However it has only done that twice. The effects from the rest were so subtle that it didn't make any noticeable difference.  I am a college student and the professor stopped the class to tell me to stop talking. I didn't even realize I was being disruptive, talking, or anything. I felt like a 5 year old and wish that I could think about my actions instead of 50 other random irrelevant things at once.  Tomorrow, I'm seeing the doc again and I'm going to ask about either brand name adderall xr or vyvanse.   I'm looking for suggestions and help from others that experience this.  When I find something I like I can focus on it until someone says to me that it's 7am and I should go to bed. When it's something I like, I become a master at it. I am a software engineer and no problem can't be solved. I've been told by many people that I'm a genius but I feel so limited because I can't do the seemingly simple things that I label as chores.
5eb0125a518d7eb724d88dc46184721306769aa75dfc558a03701b9780816b03;;;ADD/ADHD symptoms become more apparent as you get older, but before diagnosis?;;;I self-diagnosed myself with ADD/ADHD tonight, and while I obviously am not sure if I have it, I'm pretty confident. I've checked symptoms for it from multiple websites, taken multiple quizzes and I pretty much have every single symptom. I've been reading ADDitude off-and-on since then, and I'm just becoming more and more confident that I may have finally figured out why I've been the way I am. Anyways I won't go into specifics as to why exactly I think I have this, and I will be seeking a professional diagnosis once I determine who to see. But on to the question and some quick context.   Like I said I've never been diagnosed with ADD/ADHD, and really don't think I ever showed many of the symptoms outwardly. I've had many of them for a long time, but I always seemed to be able to control them back in middle and high school and it is more retroactively that I have noticed that they may have been apparent back then. Once I got into college I seemed to notice them more and they have been more and more difficult to deal with, especially now as I'm getting into tougher and more time-consuming courses, whilst also running my own online businesses.   So my question is directed more to those diagnosed after childhood. Did you notice a progression of the symptoms as you gained more responsibilities that ultimately led to a diagnosis of ADD/ADHD? Does it just get harder to handle?   I'm confident I can take this in stride and manage it to the best of my abilities, and if this is really my problem, then I'm looking forward to finally getting help for it. However, I am just starting to learn about this, and one night of research can't compare to what those of you living with ADD/ADHD know. From my research it seems like this can be just more of annoyance if I'm willing to work at it, but information articles about these types of things tend to be biased towards the positives to keep people reading, so am I being too optimistic here?   Finally, for anyone who does see this and is able to help me out, I greatly appreciate it. I know that diagnosis threads are not allowed, and I hope this doesn't come off as one, because I'm not trying to make it one. Thank you for reading.  TL;DR: Self-diagnosed ADD/ADHD at 21; Before your diagnosis, did your symptoms get worse as you aged?

I start naming with first elevens, Real Madrid starts the game and most times Pepe and Ramos gets early reds. (I know they are very good players but I dont like them)  Always I don't have a final score since I sleep even before the half time.

I couldn't asked this to him since I didnt knew ADHD well when he prescribed me.   I have been diagnosed with ADHD 2 months ago, my doc prescribed Concerta, started with 18mg for first month, now I am at 27mg. I am 36 years old, have 2 kids and I work as system admin, in front of computer all day. My psychiatrist told me I am not in a hurry in my life, as I have completed school times, so he doesn't want me to use Concerta all the time but whenever needed such as at work. For example he said you don't need to use it on weekends.   Of course I do have respect to him and any doctor, BUT. Taking Concerta early morning makes me more productive and feel better with calming down when I am at work, but when I get back home, concerta wears off and I became helpless. When I am at home, I have like 6 hours, trying my best to have time with family and some reading. Reading is important, I really love it and I am not watching TV to have more time for reading.  I haven't understood why my psychiatrist doesn't want to me use drugs for all day long. Anyone has an idea? Also, is there any known long term effects of using ADHD drugs for example 5 years? Is is allowed to use ADHD drugs for whole life?   TL;DR : My doc wants me to use concerta for only work time, but not home and personal time. So I am not good at home, not productive while reading, furious, not friendly to my wife and kids and cant do well on my own duties.

I'm on a dose that works and things are great, except I've had some serious dry mouth issues. Far worse than normal side effects, from what I've seen.       Basically I've either got to find something that works, change medications, or quit all together.       The major things the meds help with are being present and engaged when I need to be and being able to pay attention. Not to mention my fidgeting is gone.       Are there any medications (probably non-stimulants) that would work well with these issues, rather than just hyperactive symptoms?      Or solutions for dry mouth? The biggest issue I've got is my tongue gets rough and dry, and burns a little. I've tried biotene, gum, drinking massive amounts of water, etc, and nothing seems to do the trick.

I have been struggling for as long as I can remember. I tried to get a diagnosis once but my doctor didn't believe me and was generally unhelpful while makingme feel like a moron. Now I have a baby I am breastfeeding and am hoping to have a second. So, meds are off the table for a couple of years.   Dooes anyone have strategies that work especially well for them? I have a couple of books I use: ADHD Friendly Ways to Organize Your Life and The Disorganized Mind, but I feel like I am spinning out of control. I am letting deadlines slip at work, and I can tell I am about to backslide into a full career slump. Is anyone else successfully managing ADHD without meds? Is it worth getting a diagnosis if I can't take any meds anyway?

When I got to college, my doctor just wasn't cutting it anymore when it came to helping me with meds, so I switched to a psychiatrist (which I would HIGHLY recommend over a regular doctor, she seems to care a lot more about how I am personally affected by meds and my doctor never seemed to care). When I first started going to her, she asked me if I was on sleeping meds. At the time I was not so I told her this, and she freaked out. I have always had issues sleeping (still now, but I can clearly remember not being able to sleep as a child as well) and so I was excited somebody actually thought giving me sleeping meds was a good idea.  Basically, ever since being on Trazodone (1.5 years now) I have had much better sleep, and my life has basically done a 180 from what it was before.   My issues is that sometimes I wake up in such a haze, like I cannot even get out of bed or wake up at all, and could end up sleeping all day. It doesn't happen every time I take it, but it's really annoying because I end up missing class/work and not being able to do anything all day.  Does anybody else who uses sleep medications or specifically Trazodone have this issue? Any stories about being on Trazodone and how you liked/disliked it? Or anybody else have any good suggestions for sleeping better?  **tl;dr been on Trazodone for 1.5 years now, sometimes I have issues waking up after taking it, anybody else have this issue or other Trazodone stories?**

Since we were let out on Spring Break, I should've completed 5 projects. I had most of the week off and stayed in town. That anxious feeling of getting anxious from homework was the main deterrent. Now I have to go back and confront my instructor, who has already taken my accommodations in stride, and I know she will be none-too-pleased when I explain that I've got nothing ready for her to grade. I find motivation in microbursts. Those flashes of eagerness fuel me for about enough time to open up the document, and then burn out. I have no shortage of support. My housemate suffers from ADHD and currently works in the field in which I am majoring. I have a list of accommodations intended to ease my anxiety and enable me to produce quality work. I have the resources and knowledge necessary to complete these projects. I have an appointment with my professor tomorrow to do my assessment in an isolated environment. While I have her one-on-one, I'm tempted to plead for mercy, to try and make her understand the difficulties that I experience,  and to make what will likely be false promises. She's already given me her "not this shit again" face several times this semester. And this is my make-or-break semester. After this, its down coasting.   What should I do? I feel like I'm reaching the boiling point this time and I'm ready to throw in the towel.

I am meeting my therapist for few months now.    Last one was yesterday for 2 hours and she asked me about my sexual life and how it goes with my wife. I told her that my wife and I are swingers and I was talking about my experience and encounters. I kept talking and when I looked at her she was biting her tongue and kept crossing her legs and uncrossing. I felt like she enjoyed it. All I know about her is a divorce therapist and we went out after one of our sessions to drink coffee together. She wasn't open about her life but kept giving me advices in how to handle the stress in work and school for free for the entire hour.   Is it unprofessional to play with her or it is okay?

This became really ramble-y, sorry. I think the last paragraph is probably the most poignant, most in line with what I was originally planning to put down when I started writing, so read that one at least. I am sometimes very scatter-brained. ------------------------ I was diagnosed as a child, but once I graduated high school, I was asked to come in and get re-evaluated, but I was away in another city for school, and I couldn't go back to that same doctor at the time, I was like, "I'll do it when I go back for summer, or over winter break," and for whatever reason, I never did, and so I have been off of any medicine for like 6 years now and some of these weird habits are coming out. Or maybe I've got like brain cancer or something? Maybe I'm going insane.  I have become very contemplative, and I almost find that sometimes thinking about things seems to fulfill the sort of reward part of my mind as much as doing the thing does. I can spend a lot of time thinking about things, coming up with scenarios in my head, playing them out, and I can get really chuffed about an idea, get really excited about it, and then just not follow through on it. Like I almost get this weird sort of feeling like the idea is "good enough" and I know it's wrong to think this way. I'll be like "Alright, lets get started but first, oh my dirty clothes are just all over the floor, I should clean up a bit." Then I'll clean up and go, "Well it's 8 oclock I should eat." Then I'll eat and be like "Well it's kind of late to get started, I'll start tomorrow." And then on about half of the things, I never start, ever.  The other half of the things, I do force myself to start and I do enjoy them, these are personal prjects - things that I want to do - I'll get to a point where I'm most of the way done, I've worked on something that I feel like is really challenging, like for a drawing, I'll work and re-work an area until I feel like I really got it, then I'll step back and be able to see in my mind's eye I can see the end result, and I go "Yeah that's pretty good!" And I'll stop and just not start again, regardless of how finished it actually is. Or I will stop and then work on it in like 5 -30 minute bursts once a week or something. I've got a sketchbook full of like, half finished drawings. Another notebook that is full of like half brained ideas, just ideas overlapping ideas, text everywhere. An infinite bucket list of stuff I'll never get around to.  Some things are easier and I can finish, but the longer a project is, or the more involved it becomes, the less likely I am to finish, especially in one sitting. Maybe I burn out on it?   TL:DR: Even writing this, I am like, jumping around. I get the "main idea" and then go "Oh! I just had this other thought, I need to write it down or I will forget it!" Sometimes I can bring this in and edit what I write but I feel like on an ADD forum you guys would understand, right? In fact I think that's the best way to describe my mind. Ill put the main ideas down and then sort of be satisfied and start thinking about or doing something else... I want to change!

I posted in r/offmychest a while ago in a state of desperation, I guess I could call it. I wasn't in a very good place. In short, I was in a mundane and depressing cycle of (as i put it): 'Commute, work, despair, commute, gym, rinse, repeat', that was really taking a toll on my mind and sanity. The guys there were extremely supportive and opened my eyes to alot of things, which was an amazing help at a time when I had no idea what I was going to do.       Someone on that sub mentioned the possibility of ADD, so I go reading.  From someone that had never really read about any symptoms of ADD at all, I was literally floored when I read a description of the symptoms. I was reading a freaking reflection of every part of me. I sat at my desk with my hand over my mouth as this enormous wave of relief and elation came over me. I got pretty emotional in the fact that everything that I'd been feeling, (the extreme forgetfulness, constant lateness, the mind racing to different things so fast I couldn't keep up, not being able to complete a menial task without an extreme amount of difficulty, a list of simple tasks would be overwhelming, the list went on) was potentially explainable, and at that, had the potential to be overcome. For the first time in my whole life really, I felt that I could possibly achieve something.       It took me 5 months of further procrastination after posting in r/offmychest to actually see a pshyc, who confirmed I had a mild-moderate case of ADD, and that medication would improve my day to day life substantially. By this time I had also gotten a promotion at work which helped break the monotony of my previous cycle.       Today is my first day at work whilst on my D-AMP medication, and things are looking better, but not the *vast* improvement I was told I would get. I've been typing this for quite some time now and have not once branched off to look at or get distracted by anything. I haven't even been tempted to. The amount of focus and drive I feel is great. This tapers off quite quickly. That being said, I do feel that the actual level of which fluctuates quite a lot over 6-8hours. Ten minutes after typing that last paragraph and I feel almost normal again, it's quite bizarre. I feel like I'm forgetting things slightly too, I'm not 100% on the ball. Another half an hour and I might be back up again. I really hope this smooths out over time (can anyone provide info?) as it makes me quite nervous that my medication might not be working properly, or I may be pissing it out. (As a reference today I've had a Bacon &amp; Egg Roll, small amount of water and a Quick-eze which should actually help?, it's 9.30am)       DOSAGE: 10mg (2x5mg D-AMP) @ 7.10am w/no food on the drive to work. Initial effects felt @ 8am (in order of presence) -Increased sociality   -Increased alertness, able to buckle down and smash tasks one by one   -Appetite Loss   -Increased feeling of apathy, compassion, generally being a GGG.   -Jaw tightness (not clenching just tight)   -Light anxiety/chest tightness   -Constant Micro-fluctuation of symptoms intensity. Frustrating.       ADD Control: 8am after onset: 50% 9am: 30% 10.30am (now): fluctuating between 15%-30%  Phew! That took a while to get done. Sorry for the uber long post.   **TL;DR: Received elating diagnosis after becoming aware of symptoms. Moderate improvement, but not incredible. Looking for extra info pertaining to making the most of my medication.**  Thank you all.

Sometimes it's hard to remember the positive and it can feel like things are rarely good.*  **We win every single day.**  *We challenge you to write down your wins and see if you feel better looking at the list later in the week. Don’t worry if you miss a day or two or three! Do what you can. Even writing them down one day is a win.*   *** #####The Science Behind Win Wednesday * Scientists think our brain has a built in negativity bias by reacting more to a negative stimulus causing painful experiences to be more memorable than positive ones.    * In effect, our brain is like Velcro for negative experiences and Teflon for positive ones causing us to need a 5:1 ratio of positive to negative interactions to level the playing field.  * By keeping track of the good you stop positive experiences from slipping away and allow your brain to gather and store the positive. and this slowly changes how your brain is wired over time.   * Much of this information comes from *The Buddha’s Brain* by Rick Hanson. Here is a PDF of his [*Positive Emotions and Taking In the Good*](http://www.rickhanson.net/wp-content/files/PositiveEmotions.pdf).  You can find more at *[rickhanson.net](http://www.rickhanson.net)*  Win Wednesday is a chance to focus on our accomplishments for the week. Doing this enough WILL change your brain for the better! *** #####The Sacred Creed of Win Wednesday:  * **Each and every one of us have victories every week, be they great or small. But in Win Wednesday, *no* victory is truly a small one.**  * **Whatever "level" you happen to be at, progress is *always* a cause for celebration!**   * **Please don’t discount anything you have done. The whole point is to share how YOU won, and did not let your ADHD win!** Check out the examples to see what we mean!**  * The point of Win Wednesday is equally **to share our wins AND celebrate the wins of others!** If you do or don’t have a win, feel free to give positive support and cheer to those posting (not just upvoting)!  * **Each week Win Wednesday gets hundreds of views, but only 5 people replying to the winning comments...let’s change things this week!** Just saying “good job” means a lot to someone who has been struggling!  *** ##### PHENOMENAL EXAMPLES FROM PAST WEEKS:  * Started reviewing for a stats test early...beat the curve...and no longer playing catch up in math class for the first time in college (PhD student). * Went to psychiatrist, started medication, feel more ‘normal’ * Wrote an essay and DIDN’T procrastinate until the last minute (not sure if I ever did this) * Went to doctor and is one step closer to ADHD diagnosis. Waiting for psych to call back. * I can change. I can learn to have goals. I can learn to have self control, and manage my time, and connect to people.

It's exhausting and I feel neglected.;;;WARNING: this is a rant  Tl;DR - I have to work 10 times harder than others to listen, but I'm never heard. Fighting ADHD symptoms to be a "good friend" is exhausting, and I feel neglected.  COMMENCE RANT   I was diagnosed with ADHD-C when I was 6, so I've been self aware enough to figure out how to deal with some of my symptoms. It took forever, but I'm much better actively  listening, not interrupting, and not trying to talk about (only) myself too much. People are much more open when you show interest in their lives. I'm going into psychology, so many people come to me for advice and talk about their struggles.   The problem is, when it's my turn to talk, I pick up on people's nonverbal cues. They don't care. They don't listen. The exhausting amount of effort I put into trying to be a "good friend" isn't reciprocated.   It's frustrating that I, the one who has to put in 10 times the effort just to sit still and listen, can't speak up for my self. I'm the psychologist with a waiting room full of "friends" who want to talk at me. Not WITH me. AT me.  It's not that I'm sick of listening. I love hearing other people's stories and struggles. It hurts when somebody vents to me and waves me off saying "yea, uh huh, that's nice," when I speak. I'm not asking you to absorb every word that comes out of my mouth. Just PRETEND to care. I settle for fake enthusiasm!  The funny thing is, I come here because people understand this. You guys know just how hard it is to get invested into conversations. All of us are guilty, to some extent, of not being a good listener. I'd argue it's the #1 symptom of being an ADHDer. We have to WORK to absorb the information being thrown at us. We have to fight the impulse to interrupt, change the subject, and talk only about ourselves. We have to fight  to sit still, listen, and not walk away. We have to force ourselves to focus on other people. It's exhausting! Forcing ourselves to focus takes an incredible amount of energy. I'm the last person who would claim that listening is natural and easy! Conversations are like a constant battle to fight our own brains for control!  We tend to talk "at" instead of "with" people. The advice we give each other is mostly personal stories rather than true answers. We rant. We ramble. We come off as uncaring because we struggle to actively listen and focus of topics our brains brand as "uninteresting". I get all this!   I struggle with all of these things, but I still listen. I still put forth effort. I wish my non-ADHD (and ADHD) friends could do the same. I don't want to play psychologist today, can't we take turns? I'm not a shrink (and I'm not certified to be one yet anyway).  I'm tired. I want to tell my story. I want to vent about depression, ADHD, sexual abuse, relationships, drug abuse, work, school, family, friends... I just want to talk and be heard. I want to talk about my struggles and achievements. My strengths and weaknesses. I want people to take interest in my life, just as I've taken interest in theirs.   RANT OVER
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Started working 9-6... losing a crazy amount of weight.;;;So I started a new job and I LOVE it, works perfectly with my ADHD.   The issue is that I have to get up at 6:30 everyday and don't have time for an actual breakfast so I grab a granola bar. On top of that I don't every remember / have time to / have the food to make a lunch. (I am in college on a work experience for 6 months, i am 3 weeks in) On top of thaaat I take vyvance and am never even hungry during the day.  By the time I am hungry it is usually 7pm and for some reason, even when I am hungry, I have no appetite.   So some nights a eat a good solid meal and other times I just sort of pick at my food.  My walk to the train station is about a mile and from the station to work is about another mile up hill, than i do the reverse on the way back. So that is about 4 miles a day.   I have lost 15-20lbs in the 3 weeks and than gain like 5-10 back over the weekend and loose 5-10 over the week.   What the hell should i do O_o my body doesnt like the way I am treating it..

I can, however, develop a product that accurately reflects my intelligence *only* when under time pressure because I get into this "panic mode" in which my body almost forces me to focus because the alternative is failure. Anybody else?**  As a preface, I am a high school junior very recently diagnosed with moderate-severe ADHD-PI. This is all very new (and relieving) to me and I am attempting to gather as much information on the disorder as possible so I can find ways to cope. I am not yet medicated, but I have high hopes after learning the success rate -- I feel like it would be endlessly helpful.   When I have a boring task to tackle, such as school assignment, I find myself struggling to complete it unless I am doing it last minute. If I try to get a jump-start on something that is relatively easy yet uninteresting, it is a constant battle to maintain attention. My final product is fruit of a drawn-out, arduous struggle. Which, as you may imagine, does not exactly yield the best results. This kind of work is mediocre at best, littered with errors and sub par to what I know I can achieve.   It is when I procrastinate to the point in which I am sick to my stomach with nerves that I produce the kind of work that reflects my true capabilities. I am thrown into this kind of "panic mode" in which I realize if I don't do this now, I will FAIL. So I take a few deep breaths to try and calm myself, then proceed to complete my work in an uncharacteristically intense, focused frenzy. I retain more information, write more intelligently, express my ideas with more clarity, and, most importantly, finish my work at a normal pace. Instead of taking an hour to type an okay paragraph, laboriously forcing each and every sentence, I am able to bang out an intelligent, organized piece of writing in a fraction of the time.   So, basically, my entire school career has been a choice between completing my work on time, but in a frustrated, slow, and ultimately sub par fashion, or stress myself out to the point in which a "work now, you IDIOT!" switch is flipped in my brain, resulting in frenzied, anxious all-nighters in which I complete a paper that was assigned three weeks ago. Anybody else feel this way? Is this due to my ADD, or am I just a lazy procrastinator?

I'm kinda stuck on getting a diagnosis of ADHD my GP gave me a refferal through the NHS but advised me that the waiting list can be up to 18 months long; not very helpful, I'm struggling with my PhD as it is. So I started looking for alternatives in the private sector, I have found two places so far they have both given me pretty ouch-y quotes, to be fair I know I can probably find the money I just want to get the best service for it as it is a lot of money. Has anyone ever dealt with either The Priory Hospital Altrincham or Simply Wellbeing? The priory quoted me a psychiatrist for £250/hr and didnt mention how long appointments typically last, while simply wellbeing have said £845 for all the testing.  I try my best to cope with the symptoms without any form of ADHD medication, I have music on all the time (which I shouldnt do working in a lab, but it makes me pay more attention), I have a blob of blue tac that helps me deal with the urge to fiddle with everything, I do 1.5hrs in the gym every morning and some kind of martial arts class in the evening every week night, then I just walk every where. I still can't have a productive day without taking caffine tablets to keep me focused and allowing myself an extra long lunch break to make me work in the afternoons at all - I am so lucky my supervisor is so understanding of all my quirks. I have Irlen syndrome and dyslexia (sorry for all the spelling mistakes in this waffle) and when I'm in my supervisors office I have to sit on the floor and look up at him as his carpet is so pattern-y that I see it moving like a lake of lava even through my coloured lenses... Anyways I digress - again.  So in short please help, kinda new to this whole thing and still obsessivly analysing all my personality and tying it into the ADHD traits etc.  TL;DR Been given a referral by my GP to an NHS adult ADHD specialist which I have been advised will take up to 18 months, I'm struggling with my PhD as it is and need help sooner. I have found a few private places in the UK but am looking for the best option as it is expensive. Any advice would be greatly appreciated; pleases and thankyou's.
5a2ac8b16fb1282f37f99a89e0dd29d88c3201089d6b50afc0603fdf304b30df;;;Sought out counseling/therapy, they want me to go through a "battery of tests" for $1,600-$2,200?;;;I was diagnosed by a psychologist last year, and while I didn't undergo testing he had no question in his mind that I had ADD. My mom also has ADD and is in the same boat, she was diagnosed but not formally tested. I've also seen a psychiatrist for medication and he doesn't seem to question it either.  I started the medication late last year, and that has fixed the primary problem I was having -- a foggy "blankness", like my mind was t̲r̲u̲d̲g̲i̲n̲g̲ t̲h̲r̲o̲u̲g̲h̲ m̲u̲d̲, struggling just to put a thought together. Before then I could never get motivated to do anything.  After meds, Things are noticeably better, but now I feel like I have all these new demons to deal with. I'm not managing my time well at all. I get hyper-focused on tasks that are not important, and end up wasting hours (sometimes days) on things, when I should just putting them down and moving on. I obsess over details, and over-analyze things more than I used to. I can't prioritize tasks or switch easily between them. I'm always spending too much time on things that aren't that important -- I know it's happening, but it's like a strong compulsiveness.  So, my brain has been freed from that mud and fog, but now it's as if all these other aspects of ADD are also free, and have full reign over things. I feel like the meds are a good first step to getting better, but I think I still need counseling or therapy to help me get my "new life" under control. So when I emailed these guys they sent back a very long email covering their process, along with their price estimations:  &gt;* Step 1. 30 min, Meet and Greet: Cost = Free --Answers your questions in person about the process, the costs, and our practice.  * Step 2. Initial Diagnostic Symptom Inventory - 2 hours: Cost = $325. Covered by insurance. * Step 3. Initial Diagnostic Interview: Two,1-hr sessions @ $150 and $145. Covered by insurance. * Step 4. Diagnostic Evaluation: Two to four, 1-hr sessions, the first session @ $245, and the remaining sessions @ $175. Covered by insurance. * Step 5. Neurocognitive Test Battery - $375-625. Usually covered by insurance. All patients typically benefit from some neurocognitive testing, but the tests required are usually not extensive. * Report (Optional): $325-$625 -- Cost depends on who needs the reports, e.g. a college, DARS, etc. If you prefer to avoid the costs of a written report, we can presents the results of your evaluation in a free, one-hour feedback session.   They say insurance will pay, but I doubt they will, since I'm on a self-employed plan. I have to pay 100% out of pocket to see a psychiatrist, and Adderall is $100 a bottle.  Is this even necessary or worth the cost? If not, will i be able to find *good* counselling or therapy without first shelling out a wad of cash to "prove" I have ADD?

I had called my pharmacy to see if i was able to get a early refill on my adderall and it looks like i can do it up to 3 days early. now since i will be refilling it early on the 27th of this month im hoping this means i can next fill it a month from the 27th. i always get confused with my refills ;/ . i fill it at a costco and unfortunatley where i am at the pharmacey closes early on the weekends ( and i work late during the weekend) so when it comes around to my refill its always on the weekend when im unavaiable to get it. So thats why i fill it early.  i hopefully will be able to fill it if i get a 30 day supply and fill it on the 27th? also i was told i can fill it early this time, when i got my script on the 1st of may and can fill it on the 27th. hopeing this is accurate. i apologize if this doesnt make sense! thanks guys!!

It costs money. My family lives paycheck to paycheck, and I was frequently scolded for "always being sick".  FYI, my parents are both Verbally and Emotionally abusive. My father was physically abusive until I grew a foot taller than him. My mother is still Emotionally and Verbally abusive whenever we speak.  So today I said fuck it. I'm going to see a doctor about EVERYTHING that's wrong with me. Here's what we looked at! ________  * **Giant dent in my skull;** I was hit extremely hard by a metal object as a child and I believe it fractured my skull. My parents took me home to sleep, I slept for 24 hours and **could not be woken up** -- I now believe I had a mini coma.  My doctor was very worried about the giant dent in my skull and sought immediate X-Rays -- I have an appointment Friday Morning.  * **Referral for ADHD-PI;** I was diagnosed and paid out of pocket but ran out of money.  Insurance covered me now. This referral is still going through. Finally steps taken to getting back on track with a psychiatrist.  * **Referral for Sleep Apnea;** I was told I have a million of the symptoms including one on the extreme end of the scale -- My heart will periodically stop beating while sleeping for upwards of 15 seconds. When a sleep study doctor heard this she nearly shat bricks and said "Seek immediate medical help".  Referral should be ready Monday! Very excited for this.  * **5 day long headache with cough;**   This was my original and only reason for going in today... Go figure.  _____  Don't let people bully you into not seeking medical help. I've been injured more than a few times and my parents refused to take me to the doctor/hospital fearing bills.  I got a major accident and injured my head further, this was a large reason for getting the dent in my skull looked at. Immediately upon telling my mother she burst into a yelling fit of **"It's not my fault, don't blame me"**.  Because of my accident I have no vehicle at the moment i'm relying upon her for rides. When I told her I need x-rays for head/brain trauma she refused to drive me because she **"didn't care"**.

For me nobody really listens to what I say, everything I say they'll just dismiss, say oh everyone does that sometimes or they try change my opinion about it (this never works).  Id rather be treated like a normal human being, I don't mind people sharing there opinions with me but to continually try and force things upon me just pushes me further away from everyone. They still don't realise my withdrawal has been a conscience decision.  No one knows who I am only me, I've spent my whole life being  talked down to and conditioned by everyone around me. Everyone thinks I'm lazy and incapable at the things I've attempted. They assume it just got too hard for me. Everyone always says I'm too hard on myself but I'm not I know what i can achieve and its much more than anyone else thinks. Everyone either doesn't believe in adhd or don't want me to get on meds.   I've known my problems for many years and I'm just trying to get better but my support group doesn't help everything has to be done there way and  They're always right. I think they assume I'm crazy and should have no rights and can't make any decisions for myself.  It's been so frustrating I feel so alone and I just want to get better but within this community I don't think I can, everyone treats me as if im incapable to think for myself, they blow my issues out of proportion, they think they know the cause of my issues but they really don't. I know people care about me but there's a difference between caring and controlling.   What can I do? for as long as i can remember people act completely different around me, exclude me, continually testing me, trying to change my opinions, treat me younger than I am and blatantly make fun of me in front of me. Everyone thinks they think on a much higher cognitive level than I do and assume I'm dumb when I'm unsure on certain things.  Its hard to get a grasp on things when you've been constantly mislead and lied to all your life, excluded form things and treated like a lazy person whom has no empathy for anyone else. the only solution is to move away. It'll be impossible to show these people who I actually am they're all to preoccupied with they're idea of who i am which is completely false. Although part of me doesn't want to move away so i can prove to everybody how wrong they were.   I'm 21 now and this year is the first time I've tried to open up about my problems its been hard as I'm trying to share things that have never been shared they're is so many things I want to share but its hard to put words to what i want to say. For all I know the thoughts aren't even in English as I've never felt the need or tried to communicate them across to people. Its made even harder when noone believes you.

My husband and I both have it, we have different symptoms but a lot is still very much the same and its causes a lot of issues in our relationship. I have looked on my normal places but everything is "you partner does this and your non adhd partner doesnt understand" or some other form of. Everywhere I have seen is that there is one with and one without. Not both.   If anyone knows of anywhere that would be lovely thank you.

c2e08237fc236ec41be055f5064fb8ea607ca84050d8eaec156e7665ee0f1a17;;;Having difficulty working out what to do.;;;I mean in general!  I've been undiagnosed for 30 years, and recently started medication (ritalin).  Throughout the undiagnosed years, I have gradually moved into being more of a hermit. I found this to be the only solution to dealing with how differently my life worked to others. It was a massive strain to be around people who wanted to do things all the time, who did chores and had routines and knew what they were going to do with their days.  I have always filled my spare time with the internet. It's got to the stage where my time is divided up into two types: times I'm on the internet, and times when I'm not. And it seems now that the times I'm not on the internet, I see them as just interludes. Temporary pieces of time at the end of which I will be able to go back on the internet. Anything I can do concurrently with being on the computer, I do.  Internet-Shower-Internet. Internet-cook-internet. Eat while on the internet.  Internet-Work-Internet. Computer at home, smartphone if I'm travelling on a train.  Internet-see friends for day or two-internet. With interspersals of smartphone to stop me feeling anxious.  So obviously I have rather a huge internet addiction.  My problem now is that I want to tackle the problem. I want to reduce the importance of the internet on my life, and start doing other things with my time.  I want to be able to string together a bunch of things in a row without having to go back to the internet in between. I want to be able to get up, have a shower, do some chores, do some hobbies, visit a friend, come home, cook, eat, wash up, do some washing, and go to bed, without getting anxious or stuck.  But I have two problems here. First of all I automatically turn my computer on when I'm near it, which destroys the rest of my intentions. The other, and the one I hope you can shed light on, is that I can never work out what I'm going to do. I have a bunch of things I know I need to do, but I see them as kindof one-off things. So, once I've done my washing and cooking and stocked my cupboards and tidied up, there will be no chores left. What will I do then?  Basically I see a yawning chasm of time, and I don't know what to do with most of it.  What do people DO with their time??? Does leading a 'normal' life really fill all this time that I waste on the computer? (I know it's not all wasted time, but I'd say 3/4 of it definitely is) How on earth am I going to effectively replace any of it?  I think what makes me anxious is that I was never really able to look forward at long periods of the future before. The future was a theoretical place punctuated by plans that I'd made with others, and very few of my own plans. The rest of the future just felt like a replica of today, but dark and unknowable. Now I'm starting to be able to plan things for myself and to look at the general shape and direction of things in front of me, but I have nothing to populate it with. I don't know what I might do, so I'm afraid I'm going to continue to do nothing.  It's a huge amount of existential angst, I know!  TL;DR What do people actually **do** with all their time???
68f4b6910e6ab8de213577b0de3fcafb7b598d8ec514ed256c05ad13e050317c;;;I'm having trouble at work and I'm not sure if I should tell my supervisors about my ADHD.;;;**Back story**: I have ADHD-PI, I was diagnosed in high school and I've been on and off meds through college (not to make this an novel, but my grades were terrible in college until I got back on my meds and then things improved dramatically), I'm continuing my medication at work. I tried reducing my dosage or going off meds on a few occasions but the results were bad. I have a highly technical job that I love, but the work has very high requirements for precision, neatness, clarity, thoroughness etc. There's also a lot of importance behind what I do; there are some projects where my work will be part of evidence that may be present for court cases.   **Problem**: I find that I've been talked to repeated for small errors in my work; improper labeling, incomplete notes, steps forgotten and I'm worried what my supervisors think of me. This morning I was called in to fix and error in my work, I fixed it and then immediately it was pointed out to me that I'd created another error in my rush to fix things.   Long and short of it is that I feel like crap. I'm doing poor work, I'm letting down my supervisors and the old "One ‘aw, shit’ wipes out a thousand ‘attaboys’” is very applicable here. I do some good work, I think, but all that gets wiped out every time I forget to initial something or to submit things properly. I want to do good and this company has an exceptional atmosphere. I'd like to stay here long term.    **Decision**: The second problem that stems from the above I don't know if I should tell my supervisors about my medical condition so they understand why things like this keep happening.   They're older, and I know at least one doesn't believe that ADHD is a thing and that the medication for it is terrible poison that no one should take (an actual paraphrased quote). I worry that they think I'm lazy or don't care or something when in reality the number of small details, even on meds, overwhelms me somewhat and I find there's so many things that need attention that a few slip by without me catching them. I'm worried what they'll do/how they'll react if I tell them. Either they could dismiss me as lazy and making excuses, or they may think that I'm not suited to the job because my condition.   I upped my dosage and switched to Vyvanse in the last couple days so I'm waiting to see what the results are but it feels good so far. I'm not sure if I should just wait and try to soldier on.   I'm not overly concerned that I'll lose my job over this, but that is possibility that worries me. I do feel pretty bad about myself; I feel like I'm doing a poor job and that I'm not thought of well. It's upsetting to me. :(  **TL;DR**: I'm making a lot of small mistakes at work, I'm not sure if I should tell my supervisors that I have ADHD or not, or just try to figure out a way to do better which I'm not sure is possible. In the mean time I feel really down on myself about this and the old pre-med "I'm defective/worthless" feeling is once again rearing its ugly head.   Questions for /r/adhd:  * Are there any techniques I can use to try and overcome my current problems? I know this is talked about a lot here, and I've read a lot of tips. I have no real expectation that there's a magic bullet for this and I don't think this is a viable option.   * More importantly should I approach my supervisors and explain my situation? If so, how would I go about doing this? What are the ramifications? It's very scary to think of doing this and the thought is making me tear up a little despite myself, and I really don't want to break down and cry in my supervisors office over this.   Help? :(   *Edit: Any experiences that others have had in this situation would be appreciated. How did it go for you? What were the results?

I think I found the does I need, either 10mg IR of Adderall or 20mg ER of Adderall, depending on how long I need to be productive on any given day.   Anyways, about a third of the time, whenever I take my meds (or 100% of the time I drink coffee) I get a "you need to take a nap as soon as humanly possible" feeling.   Do any of you guys get this with any type of stimulant? Do you all know why? I tried googling and couldn't find anything.

(UK Question);;;Hi, So i'll cut to the chase, i know i have ADD, for sure, i am not going to discuss why, but i am certain of it (also brother has it diagnosed)  I went to a university counsellor, who wanted to test me for dyslexia, and told them i am not dyslexic, but insisted. And turns out i'm not... suprise. So i went to my GP who told me she doesn't know anything about it, so took bloods (for some reason) to ensure all my hormone levels are right? She referred me to a better GP (who still doesn't know anything about ADHD) who said "sorry although i know you have it, i can't diagnose you under the NHS as you are an adult, but if you go private they will diagnose you"  Absolutely ridiculous. Now he has referred me to psychiatrist but i am going to be waiting six months. I do not know what to do, and how i go about looking into private diagnosis and costs.  I have been taking my brothers concerta XL which has been working incredible for me at university and has changed my life. Unfortunately i run out and have gone back to being shit@life. I never told them i have had a short supply otherwise they will think that i rely on it/addicted/illegally taking it.  I don't know what to do, thanks in advance.

Everyone, that's who. So share them!;;;#### WIN WEDNESDAY: Recognizing The Good ***     A Note From Your Moderation Team: *ADHD is a daily challenge.  Sometimes it's hard to remember the positive and it can feel like things are rarely good.*  **We win every single day.**  *We challenge you to write down your wins and see if you feel better looking at the list later in the week. Don’t worry if you miss a day or two or three! Do what you can. Even writing them down one day is a win.*   *** #####The Science Behind Win Wednesday * Scientists think our brain has a built in negativity bias by reacting more to a negative stimulus causing painful experiences to be more memorable than positive ones.    * In effect, our brain is like Velcro for negative experiences and Teflon for positive ones causing us to need a 5:1 ratio of positive to negative interactions to level the playing feild.  * By keeping track of the good you stop positive experiences from slipping away and allow your brain to gather and store the positive. and this slowly changes how your brain is wired over time.  * Much of this information comes from *The Buddha’s Brain* by Rick Hanson. Here is a PDF of his [*Positive Emotions and Taking In the Good*](http://www.rickhanson.net/wp-content/files/PositiveEmotions.pdf).  You can find more at *[rickhanson.net](http://www.rickhanson.net)*  Win Wednesday is a chance to focus on our accomplishments for the week. Doing this enough WILL change your brain for the better! *** #####The Sacred Creed of Win Wednesday:  * **Each and every one of us have victories every week, be they great or small. But in Win Wednesday, *no* victory is truly a small one.**  * **Whatever "level" you happen to be at, progress is *always* a cause for celebration!**  * **Please don’t discount anything you have done. The whole point is to share how YOU won, and did not let your ADHD win!** Check out the examples to see what we mean!**  * The point of Win Wednesday is equally **to share our wins AND celebrate the wins of others!** If you do or don’t have a win, feel free to give positive support and cheer to those posting (not just upvoting)!  * **Each week Win Wednesday gets hundreds of views, but only 5 people replying to the winning comments...let’s change things this week!** Just saying “good job” means a lot to someone who has been struggling!  *** ##### PHENOMENAL EXAMPLES FROM PAST WEEKS: * Started reviewing for a stats test early...beat the curve...and no longer playing catch up in math class for the first time in college (PhD student). * Went to psychiatrist, started medication, feel more ‘normal’ * Wrote an essay and DIDN’T procrastinate until the last minute (not sure if I ever did this) * Went to doctor and is one step closer to ADHD diagnosis. Waiting for psych to call back. * I can change. I can learn to have goals. I can learn to have self control, and manage my time, and connect to people. I can escape the law of entropy.  ##### We love you, /r/adhd! BE PROUD and celebrate with each other! -- *your community managers.*  **Don't forget to join our other exciting weekly threads on Fridays and Sundays!**
74a96a1837c042c153bcb3a51a2f38db830a8191cd34b4e7badee02e3646691d;;;My experience with Vayarin;;;I searched and only found one post about Vayarin, which didn't have too positive a tone towards it, so I wanted to include my experiences.  First, I'd  recommend to everyone that they should get blood work done to check vitamin levels etc when they have any mental health issue because, while deficits in vitamins don't cause ADHD or most other disorders, they can certainly exacerbate it :p  The way it works, as my psychiatrist tells me, is that it is reformulated omega-3 fatty acids that are connected with an alkane backbone, or something of that nature. It's been awhile since organic chem, so I only loosely got the idea... Anyway, an analogue is amphetamine (Adderall, Vyvanse, others) and methamphetamine (still prescribed under brand name Desoxyn in the US): methamphetamine has a much more dramatic effect on the brain because of an additional methyl group on the amine that reduces the polarity of the molecule and thus increases solubility in the brain (because the brain is mostly non-polar fatty tissue). This reformulation similarly works via increased solubility to make it much more effective than over the counter fish oil supplements, which my psychiatrist thought were ineffective, though he didn't elaborate.  So why do we need omega-3's? Problems arise not only when omega acids (both 3 and 6) are lower, but also when the ratio is off. Generally, [diets in the US have way too much omega-6's compared to omega-3's](https://umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/supplement/omega6-fatty-acids), which creates a problem. It's especially bad for children with ADHD since we tend to have (from the same article) lower levels of both omega-3 and omega-6 compared to others.  I was already mid-20's when prescribed Vayarin, so I think the ship had already sailed for it helping me develop along a more neuronormative path, but I did notice a very interesting effect: it made stimulants feel closer to what neuronormative persons describe.  I am prescribed Vyvanse for focus problems at work. Initially, it had the effects other stimulants had on me, which included nausea (though much attenuated from the comparatively crude formulation of Adderall), a general sickly feeling apart from the nausea, and ability to focus along the lines of what you'd expect in a neuronormative person that is trying. It took awhile to see effects--this isn't surprising since it's a medical food/supplement rather than a immediate acting drug--but when I later compared my past performance and mindset to my current, I found that the Vyvanse had a much better effect, coffee actually had a decent wiring and wakefulness effect (when before it had a calming and focusing effect, with minor nausea), and I believe my baseline cognitive performance also experienced a greater increase than could be attributed to more maturity.  The [wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vayarin#Clinical_data) only cites one study, so it's hard to claim that is solid science, but I do put faith in my psychiatrist since he still actively conducts clinical trials for drugs and other treatments and is in communication with doctors that are similarly active (and he doesn't like to prescribe willy nilly). This, along with my first-hand anecdotal evidence, leads me to believe it has been a worthwhile addition to my medication regimen.   Anyone else have experiences to share?
f265ca2935ab608fc5fba2f8c2e57898bbef4c11fadb5d170f9b1ce5a4c852d6;;;I'm looking for people to share their experience with atomoxetine;;;So after years of being pretty sure that I have ADHD, it became a little too much to manage and I finally went in for a diagnosis from a psychiatrist. He asked me a lot of questions and by the end of the session he agreed with me, we talked about the different medications and he asked me what I wanted to take.  I have tried adderall, ritalin and every variation on those chemicals before and I know they work well for me but I have never even met anyone on Atomoxetine. I'm a little concerned about the long term effects on the brain and cardiovascular system with taking a stimulant on a daily basis so I jumped at an opportunity to try a non-stimulant alternative. The only thing is that I know practically nothing about this drug so I was just wondering if anyone has experience that they care to share.  Thanks.

f6661155ce9d8269c6d224ff90cda7057c7172c7aac7d36ffef1fe94a829ef97;;;What's the opinion on ADHD in the medical field these days? I'm very nervous.;;;Hey guys. This might be a kind of selfish post, but here we go...  My doctor that I always went to, the one that prescribed me my adderall, recently left the practice that my family uses. There's a new doctor there, who I've never met before. I called yesterday to get a new prescription, as mine is out. The receptionist told me that I was going to have to come in for an evaluation, and would continue to need an evaluation every three months for as long as I take the drugs. I have never needed an evaluation before in the 4 years I have been taking this drug. I don't know if the laws changed or if this is a new thing this office does. For the record, I am in New York.  With my old doctor, I told her what was up, I told her what my problems were, I showed her my initial evaluation from the counselling center at my college, she asked me a couple questions and that was it. I called the next day to tell her that I felt like I was seeing the world in a new light, that everything was more vivid, that I felt like my energy was more concentrated rather than scattered randomly. We'd known each other for a while, and I've never been the "gotta get high" sort so she trusted me. And that was it.  I don't know what to expect for this evaluation. I'm worried that this doctor will be one of those types who "doesn't think ADHD is a thing" or that "women don't get ADHD". I'm probably just being paranoid, but I'm scared, and I don't know what to expect. Since beginning adderall, I can concentrate on long projects, and string my thoughts together in a far more coherent way, but most importantly, I can communicate and listen to people, something I struggled with all my life. And right now, as an unemployed college graduate just trying to find something- anything to make some money, I really need that boost now.  That's it I guess. Does anybody else have to do this? Has anybody ever had a doctor tell them they don't believe in ADHD/they don't need drugs?  Sorry for the neurotic post. And thanks guys. I really appreciate it.  **TL;DR: What if my new doctor is like my mom and dad? Also- regular evaluatons?? ADHD doesn't just go away.**
6ed12598c73beabefc67c5f71cf692db232a406103c59a74b1ee4ea4aba61259;;;Just started vyvanse, not sure what to look for.;;;First, I'll give some backstory.  I was diagnosed with ADHD-PI (mild) after taking a battery of tests (woodcock Johnson, iq, etc.). This was recent, and the test was done because the psychiatrists were not sure I had ADHD.  The test came back and they explained to me that while my average IQ was high, I struggled on the attention and processing speed parts of the test. I was told that this is common in those people that can make their way through high school fine, but then begin to struggle in college as the workload increases.  I just finished my first year of college and really struggled to study and complete work in a timely manner, which was very frustrating to me, because I knew I could do better if I could just focus in the lectures or stay on task.  Outside of that, I don't have the severity of problems that many of this subreddit do. I would love to be able to know what to look for, as this is all new to me.  --End backstory--  I took a 20mg Vyvanse today at 10:30am and felt the effects soon after. It started with euphoria and a bit of nausea, and slowly faded into a more energetic feeling for a bit. After that, I suddenly got very tired and struggled to not nap to see the full effects of the medication. The tiredness eventually faded and I think I felt more sharp and clear in my thinking, but not enough to where other people say it is as "flipping a switch". However, I could tell when it had worn off (I think) because I could feel a transition from a clear head to a more "foggy" state. I'm now laying in bed at 2:00am trying to sleep but having a little difficulty. My body is tired but my mind is not, even though I feel like it has worn off. There might be some residual paranoia (don't know if it is from the comedown).  I guess I don't know what to look for in terms of how to optimize my medication. What should I look for to know that it is helping? I liked the clear headedness, but I didn't feel an ease of focus. Should I test it in a scenario in which I would normally struggle (such as reading or listening to a lecture)?   Sorry for the long post, I am just new to it all.  TL;DR : how should I be able to know if the medication is working properly, and that it is not too strong and not too little? Also, why did I get so tired?

I am the definition of lazy. I procrastinate everything till the last minute, get anxiety and then hyperfocus down half the work, earning me a shitty grade. I lack motivation towards anything considered work. I have always considered myself a "jack of all trades, but master of none." I pick up a ton of different hobbies that I enjoy and get motivated to do for around a week or so, next thing you know I consider that activity more work than fun, and I stop doing it. I have so many half completed projects ranging from making music, to programming videogames that its a joke.  On top of being lazy, I tend to zone out during important lectures and come back missing tons of notes (if im even motivated to take them). I also have a nasty habit of picking my fingers and my gf constantly has to stop me from playing/messing with random things while watching tv.  Sorry for the wall of text, but I am nervous that I am blaming all of this stuff on ADHD-PI and I don't have it. I guess only a doctor can diagnose me, but does anyone who's been diagnosed share my same symptoms?
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;I was tested for ADHD a month ago. Went to the doctor today for the results. I'm very confused.;;;I was diagnosed as a kid with the non-hyper version of ADHD (is ADD still a thing?).  Anyway, I've been on various medications all my life until I became an adult and was dropped from my mom's insurance.  I decided that I had a pretty good handle on my ADHD so I decided against shopping around for insurance myself.  A couple months after that, I got fired for repeatedly making mistakes (I worked in a laboratory environment) and I have had trouble holding down jobs for the past several years.  I now have a job as a security guard where I basically just sit in a room all day and do nothing.  Since I don't really do anything, I've been able to keep my job for about a year and a half now.  I have most of the classical symptoms.  I can't concentrate on details, I get bored super easily, I'm disorganized, I'm forgetful, I can't pay attention in conversations, daydreaming, fidgeting, etc.  Anyway, I got insurance for myself finally, so I was excited to be put back on medication so I can go get a "real job" that requires some responsibility.    Last month, I got tested for ADHD.  There were various tests.  I had to draw lines to distinguish patterns, there was a computer test where I had to press the spacebar each time a letter flashed on the screen (unless the letter was X), and a huge 100 question questionnaire.  I feel like there was a couple other things but I can't remember.  Anyway, today I went in for my results.  According to my results, I do things slower than I should for my age, but the results don't indicate that I have ADHD.  I'm so incredibly bummed out because they didn't even offer an alternative diagnosis.  They did say that they believe I have major depression, but that I have it very well under control and they don't believe pharmaceuticals are necessary at this time.  *Something* is obviously wrong with me since everything went to hell after I went off of my medication.  I guess I just really needed to vent. Anyway, has anyone else had similar experiences?
4df928740c09f516842b61bf20ed5cdef0990d1da336bcfebdcbe67794eb6968;;;Need to vent at the idiotic regulations on meds;;;I often don't think to schedule a refill on my medication until I'm either almost out or actually out.  Usually, this isn't that big a deal, as I can get an early morning appointment to get the prescription.  I used to be able to just call ahead and they would have the prescription waiting for me, but apparently Vyvanse is so *dangerous* that I have to have a full office visit now just for a refill.  So today I call to make an appointment.  I took my last dose yesterday, and as today is Friday, it wasn't that big a deal to be unmedicated for a day.    Surprise surprise, one of the two doctors is out of town, and the remaining doctor is booked solid.  Next available appointment is *7 days* from today.  And there is apparently absolutely nothing they can do to see me sooner than this.  I'm incredibly frustrated and angry right now at the idiotic regulations and rules that those of us with ADD and ADHD have to deal with as a result of idiot people abusing the medication that we need to have a hope of functioning normally.  It's because of them that I can't get more than 30 days supply at a time.  It's because of them that I have to have a full doctor's visit every month, just to get my refill.  It's because of them that the less educated look down on me for "not trying hard enough".  I'm not some tweaker, trying to get some cold meds for a quick fix.  I'm not a methhead, trying to cook up something to sell.  I'm not a lazy college student looking for an easy way to study.    I'm a working professional.  I have a job that requires me to be able to focus and pay attention to details, and the medication I'm on helps me to do that.  And now, thanks to the above, I get to try to go without for a week.

All my choices were made impulsively; I studied something I wasn't particularly interested in (but piqued my interest at the time), I just scooted by in high school based on raw intelligence, all the while being actually studious about anything outside of school, my choice of high school was a mistake also made impulsively, I picked a college in a different country and now I'm in the Netherlands with no real friends it seems and no real reason to be here other than a few design gigs and a boring job.   What I studied actually didn't involve any studying at all (just making, design), and I miss this dearly, because I was always a big reader and enjoyed getting into the nitty-gritty.   And now I want to go to med school, which makes so much sense, looking back at how and why I did my projects, and the things I was interested in.  And the idea sounds so cool if not silly, I could be both a designer and a physician (whatever that combination can result in), but while excited, I'm scared to go back to school for another 6 years (med school in Europe lasts 6 years), away from home. Then again, studying something that is actually a challenge and interesting could be enough incentive, but the prospect of loneliness scares me.  I'm 23 now, but I can't shake the *feeling* that it is, actually, too late and that I screwed up my start so bad that there's no way to get myself out of this rut.   TL;DR: ADHD-PI rant, started Wellbutrin, realising my life's kind of a mess, have plans but scared it's too late

It's really weird. I normally stare at my homework, feeling like I'm plowing through a giant cloud of distractions and daydreaming just to read basic things, but when the stakes get high, like when taking an exam, I can zoom through everything fine because I have adrenaline. This makes me think that I may be misdiagnosed and I'm just lazy or have bad habits.  What do you guys think? Can any of you relate?

While that may be understandable, I was on strattera for a few weeks prior and responded very well to it other than the fact that I eventually succumbed to some pretty severe headaches. In the end they called it a "neurodevelopmental disorder" - the context there being that I do have diagnosed aspergers. They acknowledged there were serious problems regarding concentration, focus and impulsivity. Problem was I tested too well on working memory and processing speed . Test involving focus and impulsivity was so bad it was "off the richter scale" and was deemed invalid.(One involving the letter X being shown repeatedly) What are my options now? Already looking at getting meds online but pretty afraid of a sketchy supplier. Can aspergers cause problems with impulsivity? Don't care about the label, just really want to get back on treatment ASAP- strattera was the best thing that happened to me in years (minus the crippling headaches :/ )
9de8f94693a44196983be183d655f8fcb7a9e4960874317d338db648aca0c4aa;;;Went to the Doctor today for something else - walked away diagnosed with Adult ADD, first day on Vyvanse. Don't know hardly anything about ADHD - Also in the same day, son's teacher wants us to talk to the doctor about his ADHD.;;;I am morbidly Obese - I weigh (as of today) 271lbs and have lost a total of 34lbs this year. I am doing it under the supervision of my doctor and this is why I was at his office today, weight check, blood pressure check etc etc.   While just shooting the breeze with him (I live in a small town and even a "brief" visit to my doctor is about an hour long - he explains everything in-depth and just talks to me about overall health and life, today he even showed me how to take my own blood pressure with a cuff!) I started talking with him about how I'm so close to finishing my master's degree and that for the first time in my life I was really struggling.   Doc started asking me a bunch of questions about concentration and various other things - you know the drill probably, I didn't. He was screening me for ADD and I didn't even know it! He told me that not only did I have ADD but I had a pretty "bad" kind - I can't remember what it was though. He didn't use the word "bad" but you know what I mean - I hope.   I have a hard time concentrating on one thing at any one time - this has been since childhood. I vaguely remember being "diagnosed" by my doctor but my dad told the doc that I didn't need to depend on a pill for the rest of my life - he'd teach me discipline and self-control.   My wife regularly has to repeat things 3 and sometimes even 4 times for me to get it all processed. Sometimes while she is talking to me, if I have something in my hands my attention just goes automatically to that! I have to physically put phones in my pocket, sit on a book, or close the laptop for even short amounts of time when someone is talking to me.   Even though I try to "muscle through" things like writing long papers (grad school sucks), taking tests etc. it is a HUGE effort for me to do so. I regularly change whatever I'm working on sometimes even as often as several times a minute - I thought I was just good at multitasking - but it was so hard to complete things!   It all came to a head last semester when I had 3 grad classes that I got A's in but couldn't complete the classes because I couldn't concentrate enough to do my final papers in all 3 classes, aced the finals and all.   Sorry for the rambling, its a lot to take in today - there are many other things but this is just a sample.    Doc gave me Vyvanse, I could tell a difference within an hour. I had a conversation with my wife where I didn't fidget with anything, kept eye contact with her the whole time and actively listened and participated in the conversation - I almost cried.   After picking up my son from school today, my wife told me that my son's teacher who has been working with some problems with him all year long suggested that we talk to his doctor about ADHD for him, too.    WHAT A CRAZY DAY OF ADHD! I woke up this morning without a clue what it really was, and now I am diagnosed and my son *may* be too.   A little overwhelming.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Now that I know more about adhd, I noticed it SO much today;;;So earlier this year I dropped out of high school because despite my grades being fine, I was sick of projects/homework/studying stressing me out and making me sleep-deprived, since I could never focus on them unless I waited until after midnight.  Earlier today I was taking half of my GED test, and it included  a section with reading and comprehending stories/documents etc, and then math. When I was trying to read the text, I *constantly* had to reread sentences because I was always getting distracted by songs stuck in my head, birds outside, the sound of the fan in the room, and the sound of people near me clicking their mouses (mice?). Also, I noticed how much I was fidgeting in my chair. Thankfully it was a chair that could spin so that helped.  As I was busing home I started playing a game on my phone but then I stopped when I realized that my phone kept going on standby (where the brightness gets very low after you don't press anything for 30 or so seconds, not sure if it's actually called standby). It wasn't because I was falling asleep or anything, I was wide awake, and I just realized that I'd rather stare out the window and let my mind wander.  That's all. I've just been really happy since I started thinking I have adhd because I can hopefully get it treated and focus on things and be productive :D I'll be really surprised if I don't get diagnosed with it... I'll probably find a second opinion from someone who specializes in adhd in adults in that case
d9fe13b5d8901fdd0540fda863f583eef313e91551baa516a8004018ef3110e6;;;Advice Needed: 7 yr old step son just diagnosed with adhd;;;My step-son was just dignaosed with adhd and has been prescribed adderall in a low dose with time release. This has all happened very quickly in about 4 weeks. Since we only have him part of the time, what are some of the things we can do to set him up for success? Is there anything we should avoid? How do we know when it's his adhd vs being a 7 yr old boy? I have been doing some research but there isn't a lot out there for his age group.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;My ADHD story;;;Hi, I'm 14 new to this sub, I was always a very rambunctious child and was VERY impulsive this led my parents to think I had ADHD and they were right. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 10 years old and thought that It would let me get away with stuff. But, I failed to realize when people figure out you have ADHD they think you are "ab-normal" or "less than good" but when the mean names and shit get to you they hit hard. I'm very open about it but it backfires a lot. I was not the popular kid and I just realized the only reason why like me at school is because I'm funny and weird but other than that I never Hangout with anyone outside of school. I went to a psychiatrist and she helped but then I was needed to be put on medication about the same time I went to middle school my mom informed them of my ADHD but some of them had the oh so famous argument we all hear "ADHD is just an excuse to be a bad kid" one teacher I had all throughout middle school was always trying to humiliate me because of it and I always stayed quiet and cowered. In seventh grade I thought " if this bitch wants to treat me like a bad kid then I'll be the worst bad kid to her ever." so that's what I did I made her life he'll just like she did to me I humiliated her on her weight as payback and she seemed to stop so I stopped then I entered eight grade and all of the teachers heard of that situation and did not say anything about it. Today I have graduated eight grade and am happy to be moving from that shithole I'm Hoping it gets better other than worse from here but you never know. Sorry but I had to vent all of this stuff somewhere.
27039ccfa1b74a7e565b125e53c0c5d96a0dd8057ac6ad4e62974f46693b18cd;;;ADHD/Depression vs. ADHD/Anxiety;;;I, like seemingly many on this thread, have been diagnosed with ADHD (for 3 years now) and depression (less than one year). I have been on Adderall for 3 years now, and when diagnosed with depression in December, I was immediately put on Prozac 20mg.    Now, I feel like depression very may well have been at the core of the issues I was facing, so I began to take the Prozac everyday. After a few weeks, a week into the new semester, I began to feel great: I was more motivated to learn, I was determined to do well academically and socially, I felt alive and ready to mingle with the world again, and so on. At this time, about a month after beginning the Prozac, I had missed two days of classes without notifying my teachers (Tues &amp; Thurs). The first day of my return, I was running about 5-10 minutes late and, while standing right outside the building, had a panic attack and walked away. This imagined anxiety of my confronting my teachers after an unexplainable absence steamrolled, and soon I was no longer attending any classes, not ever leaving my room, and dying inside.  At this point I thought I was in the "deepest of my depression" and, technically, I was.   However, in hindsight, I think the depression I (and possibly many of you?) experienced was a direct result/creation of an undiagnosed and untreated anxiety disorder. We ADHD'ers procrastinate things, leading to high anxiety, and if the procrastination/failure to do things steamrolls (like mine did), then a depressive state occurs, leading to a "Depression" co-diagnosis rather than the core issue at hand: "Anxiety".   **TL;DR: I feel like ADHD/Depression is often misdiagnosed as ADHD/Anxiety**   So, how many of you feel that this may be the case?
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;I dont know if I should help my sister or not with her ADHD;;;My mom, sister, and i have adhd. my mom is getting diagnosed officially so she can get medication and I am diagnosed &amp; medication. My sister is neither. I feel bad for her because she doesnt know the limitations that ADHD is giving her. I am 100% confident that she wont go far in life because of it.  ....but, she is a total bitch. Every word that leaves her mouth makes me envy the deaf. She is not a good person and, even considering she has ADHD, her attitude is fucking awful. All she does is complain and say bad things about other people. She treats my mom like trash and in the past when I have yelled at her for talking to her like that, she starts crying and going ballistic. I know its in our nature to be sensitive, but everything is extreme with her.  My mom cant do anything do to personal reasons and my dad doesnt have time to think about whats good for his children so I feel like its my responsibility to at least make her aware that she has ADHD in the sense that I want to help everybody with ADHD. But personally I dont want anything to do with her so idk what to do.
622c62be5fdba4040878ddcb28fedbcd8ac9922a5d8b1f48ef4e4ad37668e0c7;;;Just diagnosed, medicine-journal. Feedback?;;;TL;DR: Just diagnosed, each pill makes me feel completely different. Rollercoaster of effects and side effects.  - Pill 1: Really speedy, extremely fidgety, very focused, fair amount of side effects.  - Pill 2: Motor in my back, felt really productive, fair amount of side effects.  - Pill 3: Easier to wake up, but apathic, zombie-like. Headache, feel hungover  - Pill 4: Apathic, zombie-like, but focused. Headache, feel hungover.   Are these effects usual? Anyone else on ritalin here who can say a bit about how they experience it?   Was just diagnosed this Friday (I'm 20). Talked with the psychiatrist for forever, with my mother. What I got to know was:   - I have severe ADD  - I show some weak symptoms of HD, but it's not really deterimental to my health or well being  - They ran an IQ-test on my without me knowing, and I scored extremely high, which might be why no teachers etc. have recommended psychiatrists to me earlier.  Anyways, my psychiatrist is a bit of a nutjob, but really good. While I was in his office, he gave me 10mg ritalin.   So, pill 1, 10mg Ritalin:  - I got speedy as fuck  - Uncontrollable laugther fits  - Ridiculously fidgety  - The brain fog/multiple thoughts/whatever you want to call it dissapeared almost completely, I could talk to the psychiatrist without thinking about 5 different things simultaneously. Have all my focus on him. Felt crazy amazing.  - Really wanted to do something physical, run, shout, jump, play drums  - REALLY talkactive  - Neck stiffened up a lot, and as a result I had a mild headache.  - Slightly anxious  Turns out I am very sensitive to pills (also alcohol) and that 10mg was a too big dose. Went home, and went straight to bed and slept really heavily for a few hours. I was drained. Woke up, ate some food and took another pill.  Pill 2, 5mg ritalin:  - Motor in my back, felt like I needed to do something productive  - Cleaned the kitchen, the living room, my room and the entrance hall. Also actually noticed that I had left a pair of jeans in my parents bathroom (and brought them with me instead of leaving them there!), and I remembered taking the trash that was by the stairwell instead of just walking past it. Also I actually cleaned the whole kitchen, and didn't forget to clean parts of it as I usually do.  - Talkactive  - Neck stiffness eventually, and some minor headache.  - Sharp pain in right leg for about 3 minutes. Happened twice  - Looking at my computer screen for more than 10 minutes hurt my eyes  - Playing soothing music was really nice  - Towards the end, when I was done cleaning, I started feeling pressure on my chest  - Slightly anxious?  - Comedown was bad again. Headache and really tired. Felt hungover. Went to sleep  I had agreed that my mother would give me another half pill at 8:30am, and then let me go back to sleep and I'd get up when I felt like it.  Pill 3, 5mg Ritalin:  - Waking up was easier, wasn't completely in a haze for an hour. A lot to think about though (just diagnosed) so I stayed in bed for a while just thinking about stuff.  - Brain fog not all that present, maybe some..?  - Zombie-like feeling, apathic. Didn't really want to talk, or think, or anything.   - Zombieeeee, didn't get anything done really. Didn't want to (difference is that I think I could clean or do shit, just that I couldn't bother. Unmedicated I can't ever make myself do anything, even if I don't mind doing it)  - Sharp pain in right leg again, soon dissapeared. Is this some psychological thing? I think so.  - Eventually wore off, big hangover again.  Went shopping with my mother and brother. Aphatic, not really having any feelings. Headache. Meh, not feeling all that great. Went home, took another 5mg (just half an hour ago)  Pill 4, 5mg Ritalin:  - Right now I'm feeling sleepy. Lying in bed as I'm typing this. This stimulant is not having the stimulating effect I wanted I think.  -  Don't want to talk at all to my mother or brother, but I think I could write a hundred page novel here on reddit.   - Zombie again. Don't even wanna watch the last episode of Game of Thrones.  - Slight headache  - Neck somewhat stiff, but not much.  - Did I mention tired?  - I have never made a post online that is this structured. This list function is reallly attractive right now for some reason.
624650bb30a22c143a94544d377a14a38197ac331a2018ee2c4a27342e4caa58;;;How do you react when someone without ADHD/undiagnosed ADHD asks to use your meds?;;;Follow-up question: How do you explain the difference between the reason they *think* they need meds and why you *need* your meds?   I find it *incredibly* rude, irresponsible and dismissive of our condition, as if we have any to spare. Basically, it's infuriating - even if the person asking is someone you care about who thinks they may have ADHD.   I know some people don't like taking meds everyday - I try to take weekends off if I'm not working, too - but our condition is not, "Oh man, I have a lot of work to do this week, time to get some meds!" It is "My life is going to crumble around me if I don't take these meds every day."   To be fair, I have offered some to my sister before - I'm still pinpointing which meds work best for me, so I had a ton of extra meds before. She said it worked great, so my response was "Great! Go to the doctor for meds/diagnosis." She never did, and asked me again, which made my blood boil.  Am I overreacting? What do you think?    **TL;DR: I think it is SO rude when people ask to borrow meds. Don't know how to describe why.**
aa7fa789fe1f4c11d464236a1569dea5d52969cc7eab8a681652863a6ddaa25a;;;Visualizing;;;For as long as I can remember, I've had problems with visualizing stuff. Most people think in a mix of pictures and words, I think. For me, it's all words. It's not unusual for me to get lost in a building I should be used to navigating because I took a side door or different path. In tougher math courses or CS courses, where you're supposed to visualize how something works, it's pretty tough. Maps and diagrams? Forget about it. Can anyone else relate? If so, what are some good ways of compensating for it or helping me visualize things better?
e7d4c57bdf5a44d47269b2bcfd3a74de432d931542c2cf9cab460e08cd5aee31;;;Just Started taking Vyvanse, Anxiety hits when it wears off. Suggestions on how to deal with it?;;;Last week I was finally offically diagnosed with ADHD, at least the "D" part, and the doctor started me on Vyvanse. When it is working, it works great! After about 12-13 hours, it seems to fully wear off and while it is- I have rather strong anxiety. It's like my negative emotions are really magnified.   I find that today, I am worrying about the anxiety itself, because I have a family history of family who acted poorly nad abuseivly. I don't want to head down this route myself (Something I have always worried about.) So, my question is simply- how do I correctly deal with the emotions effectively? Usually I can just shut them out, but it seems this is not a solution anymore.   Any help at all is appreciated, I've started (today) to take a journal to better understand when this hits so I can talk to the doctor about it if I need to, and to know when I can't trust myself so I don't do something dumb.  Thanks again for any reply.
9296f917b0b3f129d687e7f4debcce72ad6f111fff4a7e4bf357db5ff4209602;;;I'm so tired of being me.;;;I've never even been tested or diagnosed with ADHD, but there's no other way I can explain what I do.   The thing is I'm not a complete idiot. I go to an ivy league school, but I'm so out of place. It's not that I can't get good grades but everyone here is so quick, sharp, focused, and motivated, and I'm so slow and my mind is always all over the place.  Despite this, I've been able to fake my way through. I try to focus on grades and clubs. I don't actively avoid social contact, but pretty much every conversation I have is incredibly forced and anxiety-inducing, and almost never ends up with forming a stronger connection with this person. I'm horrible at forming sentences on the spot, so I always have lines in my head that I'm ready to use when I see someone I know. When I try to be funny I sometimes even come off as offensive. eg. Yesterday one of the girls in my lab asked me how MCAT studying was going while I was playing a video game on my computer, and I said, "Are you asking because I'm not studying right now?" IMMEDIATELY I knew that was an unfunny, stupid ass thing to say (commence anxiety). And she seemed taken aback, and said, "Uh no, I'm just asking..." These types of exchanges happen all. the. time.   So I usually just try to ignore the fact that I'm like this. Well yesterday  at the lab I work in I somewhat accidentally read the emails between my lab professor and the graduate student there, and it crushed me.  This lab deals with plants, and I mostly just try to do my job. I understand most of the stuff I'm doing, but my professor often quizzes me on the spot and I freak out and can't give a coherent answer. I screw up sometimes, but I always do my best to fix it. I'm not close with my lab-mates, but I'm very friendly to them, and always ask how they're doing, get them food etc.   There was literally nothing good the grad student and professor had to say about me. Both of them commented on how I had the "attention span of a goldfish." My professor said "I can't stand this fucking kid," and "Most of the time I just want to tell him to get the hell out of my lab and never come back." I came in 15 minutes late once, and my professor said, "this stupid ass is making me wait around for half an hour." He even said and I quote, "yeah I think you're right, this kid is a spoiled rich kid. I think he just wears shitty, smelly clothes because his mommy can't wash them for him now." I try my best to look nice, and I'm not rich at all so that kind of just made me sad.   The grad student worked with me alone this week because my prof. was in Paris, and said, "David (me) just spilled mustard on the couch and now it smells like the State Fair. Save me."   THAT sentence, "save me," killed me. Someone that's only a few years older than me hated being around me that much.   I cried for the first time since I was 7. I can't stand being me. I don't even care if my brain has some smarts, I would rather be an idiot that people liked.   I'm sorry, I hate posting a sob story but I needed to unleash all this somewhere, and I might as well do it here.   Edit: I'm overwhelmed and incredibly grateful for the support I'm getting. It's especially good to know that I'm not the only person out there like this. I'm gonna seek counseling and testing, and maybe things will turn around.

Recently i found a passion i love though i am not good at it yet, which is sketching/drawing/lettering/design. I absolutely LOVE doing these and when i start i feel great but EVERY time i start i lose interest within 20 minutes of struggling to get started. I am still in the process of figuring out my medications with the doctor as my 10mg ritalin twice daily does absolutely nothing for me. Well the other day i did a BIG no no, and took more than what the doctor prescibed and i felt great i was focused and able to function and do my first small lettering project. But i definately will only do it once to since i am only precribed 10mg twice daily.  Anyway so what can i do that may help me out with this? I get so frustrated when i have all of these great ideas flowing but my mind wont allow me to get them out and has me thinking and doing about 15 other things at once.  My first two major projects i want to do are a lettering/drawing memorial for my dog who recently had to be put down, and a smaller lettering/sketch/drawing that will turn into a tattoo when i am finish. The second one is for my son so its definately a tattoo i cant regret.   Anyway what has help other creative types here focus and get shit done.
1dd003daf3eac4b886194a998e9af75f06f84197de7298eb8693ea9391cb0539;;;Any good mind mapping software/apps you like, use, recommend, etc?;;;**TLDR what is the best mind mapping software you have found and can recommend?**  *I am going to explain why this is important below.*  ---------  The human brain in all people is relational instead of sequentional in the storing of information.  This is different from sequential storage like a book or a computer hard drive that has a front and back and you read information from going front to back till you find what you are looking for.  You can speed up sequential access by creating an index or using certain techniques to speed up access.  If you have an index then you can skip to the place you store the info.  If you know the storage mechanism (sometimes called an array, matrix, database, web, etc) follows certain rules you can speed up access by using techniques.  For example you want to look up the definition of the word memory.  If you know the book is a dictionary, and is in alphabetical order we can use techniques to locate the 1st letter the letter m, m is the 13th letter in the alphabet so we can look first in the middle or the half way point. If we land on the letter L we need to go further in, if we land on O we need to go backwards.  If we know the dictionary is 1200 pages we may then look at the word by splitting the book in 600 pages sections.  Followed by 300 page sections, then, 150, 75, 38, 19, 10, 5, 3, 2, 1.  Thus the most amount of searches we have to do is 11 to find the page that has the definition of memory on it. Or to put another way 2^10 is 1024 and 2^11 is 2048, 1200 is between those numbers so 11 steps is the simplest way to find the info.  This is how everyone finds information in a dictionary even if you are horrible with math.  Our brain instictually knows how to find patterns.  Our brain realizes the dictionary is in alphabetical order.  *A math strong person may know it takes 11 steps  due to him being good at math *A visual strong person will effectively cut the book in half's for the visual person sees the shape  and knows what a half is. *A feeler person may use their hands to feel the weight of the book and the pages and figure out what the half is by feeling the weight and separating. Etc with more ways of figuring this out then I can think off.  ---------  Our brain has several different parts and each one looks at the problem differently.  Our brain tries to solve the problem in the most efficiently possible, using the least mental energy to do so, thus conserving more brain fuel such as neurotransmitters and glucose.  ADHD people often have a strong sense of visual thinking for ADHD causes changes of neural development and neuro chemistry.  The visual part of the brain does not need as much dopamine and norepinephine to function for other neurotransmitters affect this part of the brain more than dopamine and noreinephrine.  Sometimes the visual section is overdeveloped than the average population for we ADHD people compensate for our lack of effective sensing and thinking in the parts of the brain ADHD makes us bad at.  Thus it is good to organize information visually for if we organize the information visually it is easier for our brain to see the visual pattern.  It is easier for our brain to make connections and recall things.  Other methods work better for other people depending on their talents and skill set.  ---------  Mind mapping is a way of trying to store information visually and establish visual relationships.    You start with one thing, usually drawn as a circle and develop branches with other ideas, things, traits.  It works even better if you can catergoze the information maybe use different shapes as classifcations, circles for nouns, triangles for verbs, squares and diamonds for adjectives and adverbs, etc.  Using different color for the branches to show the type or strength of the connection.  Aligning your style of organization to how your brain processes information makes it easier for your brain to recall memories and knowledge both short and long term.  ------------------  Anybody got any good recommendations?

Wow, I instantly now know what parts of me were "ADHD" (I was totally blind to the extent I was displaying symptoms)...I can't believe I just dealt with it my whole life...I'm a woman (29) and did very well in school and never caused trouble in class (though I did spend ALL my time doodling...I just wrote it off as being "artistic"). Plus I was diagnosed with ADHD combined, not even ADHD PI, so I'm very surprised that it wasn't caught earlier. I'm not blaming anyone, but I basically spent my childhood running around in circles and slowly developing a horrible sense of self-esteem.   I'm just glad that the curtain is starting to lift :-)   but I can't help but think how my life would have been different had it been caught earlier, I don't know if I would wish the ADHD away as I believe it has made me a very creative person, but a self awareness of it would have been tremendously helpful...even though as a child/adolescent I probably would have really resented being "labelled" haha
dc94aede14aa226af26ee2a139f7eed9fc65bb97e1cf621c46ae87e0ad3b14c3;;;How others aspects of life can boost your ADHD?;;;Hello, i'm Axl Salv Torex, i'm not a native english speaker, so sorry for any mistake here.  I'm naturally a anxious guy, this can be confirmed with my OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) syndrome (now in controll) and maybe my social anxiety.    My point here is, how others psychologicals ill's can affect directly our ADHD? look, the fact i have social anxiety make me be always over thynking, to the point my mind get tired. So i was before a normal guy,  my parents had said to me a couple of times i had ADHD, but i never belive it, since i never had problens with it. But now this is a REAL problem to me, this get worse and started to prejudice me and i perceived that this came after my over thynking experience and OCD experience.  I thynk my mind is tired and maybe it boosted my weak and no problematic ADHD to a powerful one.   Can someone explain better what is going on with my head? Thanks everyone! i apreciate every help :)
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Same mistakes weeks after weeks. Worried about my future.;;;I am sorry if this post ends up incomprehensible, I have so much on my mind.   I was diagnosed and put on Ritalin during high school I attend a university now. Not failing any classes but nothing to be proud of.   Thing is, I could do so much better, not because I believe that I am smarter than my grades reflect but because I don't really spend my time on tasks that are important.  For example I had an assignment due earlier this week but instead of working on it this whole week I spend my free time doing things like:  Setting up openvpn server on lowend VMs and comparing the performance.  Looking up how to take apart and clean a air con unit.  And god knows what else, in the end I have nothing to account for what I did this whole week and the one before that and so on.  I won't even mention the hours of reddit and porn.  Same goes for my work, I do freelance work to pay for school and constantly find myself failing deadlines.  I thought it was because I had 2-3 projects/clients at a time so I cut back to doing 1 personal project and one client's at a time. But I am still finding myself in the middle of the night realizing I spent hours in front of my computer doing everything but what I was supposed to do.  One of my clients a redditor has been very understanding with me but I am so ashamed of myself because I keep missing deadlines.  TBH these odd urges to learn new things has taught me a lot of different skills, but what's the point of being a jack of many trades when I can't do anything real.   As much as I love what I do, I dont think I can ever have a successful career.   TLDR; Can't stop wasting my time learning random new things, addicted to porn and television. Depressed every night before bed. Wakeup to repeat same cycle.  Chances of ending up homeless after uni, 100℅.

They say they are adhd, they /act/ unmedicated - always moving, always talking, always bouncing etc.  i know its not their fault.  but it messes with both my anxiety and slightly my adhd - something is moving near/behind me i need to know what it is (maybe thats just hypervigiliance).    how do you handle this?  Its a call center, so i have to be focused.  i am medicated.  but if he is, he's not on a high enough dosage /or/ he needs to take it before work (our shifts are from 5p to as late as midnight, i work 5p-11p).  one night he was doing squats in the aisle (you're supposed to stay in your cubicle all shift).  i feel like its not a good fit of a job for him (he also cannot stay on script)  TL;DR  How to handle an unmedicated adhd coworker in a call center?
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Started taking Vyvanse 30mg on Thurs. and it worked great, has no effect since. sos.;;;[hello, i'm completely new to posting on reddit, so if i screw anything up im sorry.] Anyway! My doctor prescribed me 3 medications on Wednesday 18 June to take daily: Vyvanse 30mg (ADHD), Buspirone 5mg (Anxiety), Trazodone 50mg (PTSD/Nightmares 'n' sh*t).  I am a 17yo, 5'7", female and weigh in the 145-160lbs range (got that chub chub). I am an almost vegan (vegetarian who strays away from milk and cheese and eggs as much as possible cause it just tastes bad a lot of the time idk) and i have a very fast metabolism. i also have an iron deficiency [its not /that/ bad but still, yeah..].  I take the Vyvanse and Buspirone in the morning and then Trazodone and Buspirone at night.   Wednesday night i took the Buspirone and Trazodone and immediately noticed the effects of the Buspirone and slept very well that night.  Thursday morning i ate a bagel w cream cheese and took the Buspirone and the Vyvanse 30mg at around 10 am and the Vyvanse did not begin to kick in until around 12-1pm. I felt very motivated and energetic and got a lot of things done that had needed to be done for weeks. I applied for two jobs, cleaned the house, and settled college orientation issues AND i still managed to go out to eat with friends. All throughout though i barely ate all day and spoke really fast and talked a lot and felt like my hands were shaking (like drinking a gallon of coffee at once) but they were steady the whole time The effects began to wear off at around 7-8pm and fully wore off at around 9-10pm. I then took the Trazodone and Buspirone at around 10pm but i did not sleep all night.   the next day (Friday) i did the same routine but at 7am, and i had my freshman college orientation that morning and all day on no sleep at all. I was hoping the effects would kick in at around 9am, an hour into the orientation, but nothing happened... the whole day. I spoke to a lot of people and made a lot of friends but i think that was because of the Busprione. I found myself doodling on papers throughout this long 3 hour assembly from many of the faculty (aka death). and i really could not focus on anything, especially when trying to explain things and idk. I finally slept that night but went to bed really late.   Today (Saturday), i did the daily routine again at around 10am and NOTHING HAPPENED AGAIN. whyyyy!? :c  TL;DR: Vyvanse 30mg was prescribed to me for ADHD &amp; ADD and it worked amazing my first day (wednesday) and has not worked at all thurs, fri, sat. someone help.    [[Personally, my system clears incredibly fast from any drug; legal or not.  story time: I was placed on an informal probation a few months ago for possession of marijuana* and the two weeks before i got on it i smoked and abused high doses of vicodin* everyday for those two weeks. even the night of the day before. that day my probation officer piss tests me and they're all like "i know its not going to be clean dont cry blah blah blah" (lol) so i did it. and the next time i came in they dont me it came back clean. im sorry but what?? i do drink a lot of water daily but even so.... but i dont know if this would have anything to do with the vyvanse situation but i feel like i would. idk...]]   did my body just get tolerant to it that fast or does it just go in and right out or idk. any help would be amazing. and highly appreciated. ty
df49186ba059ef45fa57eee2b432b134cd6d59d5f4f4ed7097b982ca4eb905fa;;;Probably the worst part of it all;;;When I was a kid I loved reading, I remember picking up any book I could find at home and just reading it till I was done. My mom took me to the library every week as well so I did have something new to read most of the time. As I got older, I ditched my old hobby and became obsessed with video games like most guys. All the hours I used to spend on reading were replaced with gaming and I wouldn't even notice the hours gone by each day. In school, I always found it hard to read my textbooks, there was really nothing that interested me besides math, because it involved actual application and not just sitting around memorizing the bold words. However, English was a special subject to me. I didn't write well but I loved to read the books. And when I reached high school, I absolutely loved everything we read, especially the Shakespearean dramas. I wasn't a fast reader, but I hated reading as a class because there were other students who were much worse than me. Their voices just put you to sleep, they dragged on each sentence and every mistake they made in pronunciation just bugged the crap out of me. The teacher was the only person I approved of for reading to the class, not just for the speed but because of the knowledge of symbols, hidden meanings, etc.    So skip forward a few more years and I'm in my second year of university. At this point I cannot finish reading chapters of my textbooks. I always found myself rushing through the last 4 pages of each of my chapters and not even knowing what I really read, but it didn't matter as long as I was done. And to make matters worse, I never read all the chapters for my exams either. I had an economics exam with 19 total chapters, of which I only read 11. and when classes started to demand fewer chapters per exam (5-6), I would usually only read about 4. Needless to say, my grades plummeted and I just played video games more and more to try and forget about everything. But during my 3rd year of University, I realized how stupid it was to continue playing video games for my distraction. I already wasted enough time doing who knows what, and I thought that if I was going to be distracted, I should do something productive with it. At this point I realized that I had gotten even worse at reading. I had a hard time getting through each chapter and found myself rereading paragraphs because I had zoned out just one sentence in. I tried to pace myself but I really wanted to finish the book, but at the same time I felt like I had to put it down every few pages. So this went on but I did manage to finish some novels until I reached a point where it had taken me a few days just to finish 1 chapter of the Hunger Games. I kept spacing out with each paragraph, kept rereading it only to discover I had spaced out again, and I just put the book down. I couldn't handle reading it anymore because it felt as if I was just reading my textbooks. At this point I was really disappointed. It felt as if I had taken the one opportunity I had to do something productive with my wasted time, and just completely blew it. It's been about 6 months now and I'm still stuck in that same spot, and at this point I keep telling myself I will finish it, but everytime I open it up, I just can't do it.    TL;DR: I used to read for fun, as I started to grow up I found it harder and harder to read. Textbooks were hard to follow but novels from English class were usually ok. I tried to novels for fun in University but I can barely finish a chapter at this point.    I apologize for the long text, I guess it became a rant at some point but did anyone else have this problem with something they loved?

But I could hardly focus in class or do anything except sports. That was the main thing I can excel at. I was on Ritalin as a kid and they took me off of it when I was 12.  But now that my professional sports dream is down the drain and I am going to school while working in the "real world" I am struggling.  School is not hard but my organization sucks and I daydream while listening to lectures.  I feel unmotivated and depressed. I isolate myself from others(mother says I am just an introvert but thats not the case. I like being around people I am comfortable with.)    My mother says that "I am over it"  which I think is completely untrue.  In the military I struggled with remembering daily tasks and what not.  So I am thinking about getting reexamined  by someone in the VA (Lets see how long that takes lol) so that I may see what treatment I need. I am also thinking of getting CT scan of my brain. I have been having pretty bad headaches since the military and I think I need to get checked out.  What do you think?
4cee6b190e99f9912335f945f3691652e76e28f591c028d294f1c9cd0fa3a2b7;;;ADD, OCD, or both?;;;I've always been diagnosed with ADD, but lately, I realize that the main cause of my distraction and lack of drive is because I'm always thinking! I tend to be distant or slow to respond to conversations because I'm constantly being distracted by something the person is saying. I realize most of the time I'm in my own little bubble of contemplation and this is noticeable to others.  I have considered maybe I have OCD (it runs in the family), and if I wasn't always distracted by constant thought, I wouldn't suffer from these ADD symptoms. I would like to note that the thoughts I have are neither good, bad, nor obsessive. More so observations and analyzing.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Do I just straight up ask my doc for a much-needed higher dosage (Adderall)?;;;(F/22) I've been on Adderall 20mg with a 5mg "evening booster" for as long as I  can remember, which has been most of the 3 years I've been diagnosed. I first started on 10mg but wasn't on that more than a couple months.    **Now let me just lay this out: I am as fond of my psychiatrist as I am of getting food poisoning. Not much at all.**  I started going to him originally because he was downtown (centralized college town) and I didn't have a car yet to drive to see anyone else. He was convenient. I mentioned a year or so ago that I thought I may need a higher dosage for x and y reasons, his response: "You haven't been on it long enough yet for that to happen". When I told him Adderall made me jittery and smoke near a pack of cigs a day, so I wanted to switch meds to feel healthier, his response "Well, none of that sounds good." **NO SHIT!**   When I told him I was depressed, though, he was scarily quick to throw a Prozac Rx my way, which I stopped almost as fast. He makes me feel like a junkie/ashamed to voice my opinion asking for a higher Adderall dose after 3 years, oh and how many goddamn times do I have to say "Anxiety is my real problem" thru the months for him to finally try me on an anxiety medication?   Since all this guy is good for is writing my prescriptions right now until I find &amp; get into a better psychiatrist, should I just straight up say "My medication is not working. I need a higher dosage, as well as something for the anxiety that's been ruining my life" or will he just write me nothing, then? He's a sweet old Indian dude, just totally oblivious to being a good psychiatrist. In 2 weeks I have my next appointment...what to do?    **TL; DR: Can I just blatantly ask my POS psychiatrist of 3 yrs for a specific higher mg dose &amp; for anxiety meds? Been ignored in past visits for "beating around the bush" about what I wanted.**
622c62be5fdba4040878ddcb28fedbcd8ac9922a5d8b1f48ef4e4ad37668e0c7;;;Any other ADHD/ADDers who score extremely high on IQ-tests? How do you use your abilities effectively?;;;Edit: Thanks for all the answers, it has been insightful. I am well aware that IQ is only one minor aspect of success, but I still do not think it is right to disregard IQ completely. What I have realised is that I have to spend much more energy staking out a career path where I can fully utilize my strong sides while delegating away weaker sides. Seems obvious really, but I have always wished to perform well on my own, and admitting that there's things I'm just really bad at (to the degree that I have no chance of doing it myself) is difficult, especially since I'm recently diagnosed. So, again, thanks for the replies, they've made me reflect.  ------   First off, I want to clarify that I am not seeking to brag, nor position myself above others. IQ is just a score, and does not mean much in the big picture. I just seek advice on how to handle this aspect of my life.  About me:  - Recently diagnosed with severe ADD  - Psychiatrist ran an IQ-test on me and I scored 140  I am on medicine now for the first time in my life, and things are definitely looking better. However, I wonder:   - Are there other AD(H)Ders out there who score extremely high on IQ-tests? I have an inkling that this is more normal among ADDers compared to the general population.  - If yes, what are you doing with your life? How do you make sure you use your intelligence in an effective and good way? I feel that I have extraordinary capabilities, but that I've never been able to be even close to using them. How do I change this, now that I have medicine?  Answers would be greatly appreciated  PS: English is not my mother tongue, so please bear with me regarding grammatical mistakes.
f926c32052135fbe3a69cf0ffcb53da9876aa9a1e9a236507a8fc2b0ce9e5976;;;I hate my insurance company;;;Resumed ADHD treatment last fall - psych was nice and close to home saw him every 3 months for ten minutes, picked up a script at the front desk each month in between.  Perfect.  So of course he leaves the practice...  See another psych - same deal.  Nice, same location, 3 months scripts at desk in between..,perfect.  He leaves the practice to go join the other guy.  Tells me I can see either over there as they take the insurance -great.  So I don't need another appt till next month.  Turns out they take the PPO not my HMO version so call to get another doctor - no one takes the HMO anymore.  6 hours of phone calls for my husband later (in the course of a week) he finds out the insurance part that covers this isn't called the HMO it's some other acronym so now calling around to see if the old doctors take that, or if I need to find new,  And as of day after tomorrow I'll be out of meds.  And it's one of the two busiest weeks of the year for me where this twice annual project I head goes into effect and I have a million balls in the air and work 80 hour weeks for 2 weeks.  Yay.  **tldr I am convinced they make insurance extra complicated and run a roundly so we will get frustrated, give up, and won't use it.**
f5d149780ece876b94365f0d3b0fbc4352578530dcd5933f7e456f072ebc044e;;;Are we doomed to chase the reward chemicals we don't have?;;;AFAIK, ADHD is really the lack of dopamine (and somewhat norepinephrine) caused by too many neuro reuptake pumps or inefficient brain-cell membrane transfer mechanism.  So we spend a good part of our lives chasing those reward chemicals, even to our detriment... in many ways that may not be obvious...  We read books about cool stuff (which is stimulating) when we should be studying for that math test.  We run on a wet surface (because we're impatient) when we should be walking.  We dominate conversations (we like the buzz of being the center of attention) when we should be listening.  And --depending on what we can afford-- we do dangerous thrill-seeking stuff like skiing, motorcycles, sky-diving,  etc (sometimes ending up disabled or dead)  All because we lack those reward chemicals.  What else?
4e1f9462afdeeca70e8087ce494d8a2da6efa1fb7a68e29d524be1d97b7be22a;;;I want to start a project car, but ADHD has caused distrust with my parents.;;;I’m only 16….and a girl. A little over a month ago I was formally diagnosed with ADHD-PI and put on Vyvanse 30mg (though I was recently bumped up to 40mg and today is my first day on it).  I’ve always been really interested in cars ever since I was little. And I really want to start a project car, I have since I was 9, but my parents don’t even want me to have a car until I’m 21, which is when he bought my sister her car. I also think that you should know how to fix up a car; it’s a really valuable skill.  I mean, right now, I don’t even have my license, not until November, but I really want to fix up a car this summer or the next. I don’t even like driving when I’m not on my meds, it makes me feel uneasy because I know the statistics for teens with ADHD.  My ADHD, like most other people with it, has caused me to lose interest in hobbies and activities really quickly and jump all over the board. My parents always bring up my past hobbies and use this against me whenever I say I want to start something new, no matter how much I really like it.  I mean, they put me in dance programs and sports when I was little, but I never chose them myself, so I never liked doing them. And then my dad forced me into golf, which I hated so much and only played for a season.  Now, when I’m on my medicine, I can really focus and do the stuff I want and be a normal person.   I also want to pay for the car all by myself.  I have a summer job and I make decent money. How do I get them to forget the past and look at the person I am now and let me do this?  Any advice would be helpful. Thanks. And sorry if this was the most disjointed thing you’ve ever read.
e4ae337b453b49542ce19c1d9ffef4e1a1c1d699319fc2c9bd0332f2c2c6623c;;;So I finally got diagnosed on Saturday..;;;Win! Specifically, the doctor diagnosed my as the combined type, which I'm almost certain is correct.  My psychiatrist put me on Strattera, which, so far, has enabled me to clean my room. Such a shocker. I'm the 25mg pill first and later on will be taking 40, then 60, then 80.  On 25mg, I still have troubles with concentration. I tried reading a couple of paragraphs from a book or a magazine but I still wasn't able to read thoroughly and my comprehension is still lacking.  What is YOUR experience with non-stim drugs?
1dd003daf3eac4b886194a998e9af75f06f84197de7298eb8693ea9391cb0539;;;I HATE being my dad! Anger and ADHD, a rant and asking for help.;;;**TLDR How to deal with anger when it does happen even if it does not happen frequently.  Sometimes the anger is so raw you destroy friendships and relationships.  I am not an angry person usually and most of the time I have positive ways of expressing anger.  But sometimes it is so quick and white hot I do not know what to do, I just ask and then it is too late.**  &amp;nbsp;  ---------  Warning I am just letting all the emotions out and expressing myself so I will do things such as all caps and such.   I HATE BEING MY DAD!!!  I hate how sometimes I can not control myself.  I hate how only occasionally I lash out and cause so much pain at once and then the friendship or the relationship is unsalvageable.  I hate how I am not able to express my feelings, to put my feelings into positive words instead of destructive actions.   I hate how I reduce my emotions and empathy is everyday life for emotions and empathy come on so strong for me.  I HATE IT.  Not being able to feel until it is suddenly so strong.   I hate how instantaneous the transformation can be.  How I can go from a 3 in the irritation scale out of 10 to suddenly a 9.8.  How people are suddenly surprised how I can so quickly jump from such intensity.  How those people either stop having a relationship with me for I am too scary or too extreme.   I AM TIRED OF BEING ALONE!  I DO NOT WANT TO BE MY DAD, with two failed marriages, most of his kids hating him, and no real friends.  I do not want to be like him.   Like Dr Barkley says people will forgive many things from you.  They will forgive your eccentricities, they will forgive you impulses, they will forgive you when you are unable to communicate, they will forgive you being what they see as weird or different.  THEY WILL NOT FORGIVE YOUR ANGER!  I hate this.  Do you know how many relationships I have killed because of a single argument.  How I have literally lost a best friend in the past due to a single fight OVER NOTHING.  Just a stupid fight that happened in less than 1 min, arguing over something non important (It was economics and it was simply a matter of a difference of opinion.)  How I have hurt my brothers and sisters in the same way but maybe not to the same extent.  How I lost my other best friend at the time only a few years later, for I was dealing with emotional stuff, and I felt too exposed, to emotionally vulnerable, that I let the relationship die due to almost no contact for I was afraid of what I may do, or what that person would do to me.  I just could not handle it.  I now know this is due to ADHD and certain parts of your brain regulating your actions when you feel emotions.  It has to do with the fact your emotions are real, but normally a person has a part of the brain that is a filter, a conscious that holds them back, and not say the anger or say the hurtful feelings they are really feeling inside.  WHERE THE HELL IS MY JIMMY CRICKET.  Why am I so unlucky to be born this way.  Why the fuck I am the unique person that is like this, why I am part of the 5% or whatever the number is of people that have ADHD.  -----  What brought this post on was I had two fights with my sister I barely see during 48 hours during a vacation.  The first one was in the car where we had a disagreement over a word choice I used in a conversation.  I said allergies were toxins when I meant to say irritant but my brain went for the wrong word.  She would simply not let me speak, filibustering for over a minute, and not letting me correct myself.  NO I WAS JUST FLAT OUT WRONG AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT.  The second time happened less than 30 mins ago, for I was asking my mom what is our family history of allergies for I know of some but I was wondering if there was any more.  My sister raised her voice maybe 5 or 10 decibels, she did not even realize she did it, and on the anger/frustration scale she was only a 4 or 5.  My body instantly went to a 10, I yelled, did not remember what I said and then stormed out.  When I was alone and safe, only 2 or 3 mins later I felt safe enough to continue the argument in my head.  If you were to touch me during that brief window of me being so hot, as an unrelated person who may be trying to comfort me I would snapped, pushed you away and probably unintentionally cause physical harm.  Just do not touch me.  I sent her an email explaining why I got angry and a link to Wikipedia that showed some allergies are genetic some are not SO WE WERE BOTH FRICKIN RIGHT.  30 seconds later I sent her a second email apologizing.  I then wrote this post after being furious at myself and how I can not control myself sometimes.  I am so angry and hot about being ADHD, I understand it is neither positive or negative just different.  I understand some of my strengths come from my ADHD.  Yet I hate it.  I am about to post send, and I realized this right before I push post, I have not taken any beta blockers in the last 3 days even though I have been on them 1 a day for two months.  I did so for I have not had an anxiety attack since being on them though 1 or 2 close calls.  Right now my liver is acting up and stressed due to an unrelated reason so I figure I would not take the drugs I do not need to give my liver some rest.  I have since taken one, but it is way too late.  Take a pill may make you feel better but it does not erase the damage that is already done.  ARGHHHHHH I hate feeling this way.

Honestly?  I feel like nothing goes for me.    My parents are two very successful people in the business and financing industry and I greatly look up to them for their success.  I was always regarded as very intelligent-- in 7th grade, we had to write a short story in my life science class and I got sent to the office because apparently my literature skills were so advanced that I wrote better than some of the middle school's teachers.  Weird.  I've entered my literature into writing contests but have never won one, unfortunately.  I am also an artist and I strive to be an animator when I grow up, a dream of mine I've had since I was 9 years old-- and I've been animating since that very age.   However, despite all of these feats I feel like a complete utter wreck.  My parents have always thought of me as more immature than people my age and we've recently discovered it's due to ADHD-- finally, an answer for my scatterbrained tendencies, my flakiness, my short attention span, and my general laziness and lust for stimulation.    However, at the same, time I feel like it's my down fall.  I feel like no matter how hard I try, I am never good enough.  When I was 11 I was molested, and it caused me to have psychological trauma to my mind in the form of sexual promiscuity-- specifically towards older men. (My boyfriend is my oldest relatinship so far which is a year and a half).  I barely passed all of my classes up until now-- where I passed all of my classes Sophomore year with straight C's.  Honestly?  I look at my peers and I get deeply depressed.  They manage to get straight A's with little effort, while I spend days, cramming for tests just to barely pass them.  I feel like a world like this isn't suitable for me, I feel like this type of society isn't right for me.  Everything is so structured, while I just want to be a free spirit.  It's completely unfair.  I've been self-harming since 7th grade, and during Middle school the school psychologist tried to put me into special ed classes and I was also diagnosed with an "unknown learning disability"-- which is a blow to my self esteem.    My dad isn't that much helpful himself; he doesn't really believe in mental illness much, and he doesn't really think triggers really exist and simply regards my panic attacks as temper tantrums.     TL;DR:  Junior in highschool with ADHD, along with other mental illnesses, taken advantage of when I was 11 which fucked me over mentally when it comes to sexuality and sex.  Peers get better grades than me without trying while I barely pass my classes.  I feel hopeless and feel like I'll never achieve in life and thinking about committing suicide.

I get really odd episodes when the medication wears off, to the point that I have thought it is psychosis.   I am regularly experiencing a feeling of extreme detachment and surrealism, like the reality I'm experiencing is coloured/flavoured somehow, and my normal mind/self isn't me, like it's been put to sleep and replaced temporarily with a really weird unpleasant drone. The whole "experience" can wear off in minutes, I feel myself returning to a 'normal reality', and I suddenly become aware and feel relieved that I can think my own thoughts again. I don't have any visual or auditory hallucinations during the 'episode', more like a hallucination of my sense of reality.  A family member of mine recently also started ADD medication, but of Novartis brand. I was under the assumption that they are the exact same thing, but we have the same doctor so I was puzzled as to why the doctor would give us different brands. I was expecting that he (family member) would begin to experience similar weird side effects as me during the come-down from the meds, but he appears to be completely unaffected in the way that I am.   I have read online that there are some differences between brand name Ritalin and variants such as Rubifen, but haven't found much solid information in the difference in side effects.   Has anyone here had experience with both medications? What differences in side effects did you have? Have you ever experienced the weird side effect I tried to describe? I will be seeing my doctor soon for advice.

We found this sub a couple of years ago, and both started getting medication. But we decided to try getting pregnant, so I've been unmedicated for months. I'm facing a bit of a career fork, where if I decide to go for something more high-profile, it's going to take a couple of years of serious moneymaking and dedication, with no time for a kid.  Even if I don't go the more high-profile route and go for a kid before 40, we're not in the best position financially. Hubby's in school for the next 3 years, and I'm working my own business (music teaching), which requires insane organization. One weekend with both of us feeling impulsive can really wreck our financial plans, even if it's just eating out 3 meals in a row.   Being unmedicated while trying to conceive really limits what I can accomplish financially. I have SO MANY ideas! But it's all I can do now to stay on top of the studio and my church job, and all my ideas rely on me being able to buckle down and practice/blog/record/advertise, etc. etc. It's so frustrating because I remember what being on medication was like, and how easy it was to focus on doing things I wanted to do.   I'm seriously considering going to the doctor and demanding birth control pills and Ritalin. But that telling my family and friends that the kid plans are on hold because of my failure. And risking whatever older women risk when they do have kids.   **TL;DR: Biological clock ticking; need meds to focus on career and stability; anyone else in the same boat?**  **EDIT:** Since it's been mentioned more than once, I have spoken with two primary care doctors about taking meds while trying to conceive and getting pregnant, and both said that it's not a good idea to be on the stimulant medications.

Sorry if my title sounds... clinical, or terse, I wasn't sure how to succinctly put what I wanted to ask.  &amp;nbsp;  So, last year, I was diagnosed as ADD (not ADHD, but I feel like a lot of the same symptoms apply and r/ADD is dead...) which was sweet because, in my head, it made so much sense.  "Woah, this is why I never finish anything.  This is why I can't concentrate.  This is why I... x, y, z."  You get the point.  My doctor said that its really common for females to go undiagnosed until later in life, because they're quiet and shy, and nothing seems wrong, for instance.  Also, in my case my step-brother was hella ADHD and by comparison I seemed like everything was hunky dory.  When there's him, riding his bike to school and then calling for rides because he forgot he had done so and misplacing all of his stuff all the time.    &amp;nbsp;  Anyways, I'm digressing here, my real question is this: my doctor gave me a little test to take, about 25 questions, to determine whether or not I qualified as ADD.  But when I took the test the questions asked had nothing to do with concentration problems and everything to do with sleeping patterns and stuff like that.  My doctor really didn't give me an explanation of what this  surveyed and I was wondering if anyone here had taken a similar rubric, and what something like that was actually measuring.   I also noticed that a lot of the questions repeated themselves in different ways.  But I have no idea what that means.  &amp;nbsp;  **TL;DR:** What type of test did your doctor administer to determine whether you were ADD/ADHD?

I make a lot of careless mistakes that sometimes I can't even catch (changing a positive to a negative, thinking one number is another number, etc.).   Right now, I am taking Calc I. Up until Friday, I had a low A in the class. Then, I took test #3, and I couldn't do anything right. Even as I was taking the test, I could tell I was messing everything up. I was having the same problem earlier in the day when I was trying to do practice problems to study. I ended up sketching my graph upside down. I forgot to add "+ C" to all my integral answers. I spent a half hour on one problem because I kept entering the problem into the calculator wrong.   I don't know if background information is needed, but I was diagnosed with ADHD 3 years ago at age 25, and I have never been medicated. I don't really have the means to become medicated.   Does anyone know what is happening in my brain when I am taking math tests and what I can do to remedy it?  Semi-related to this, I have trouble visualizing shapes and graphs in my head. Does anyone know how I can learn to visualize them?

dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Meditation, ADHD, rant;;;About a month ago I upped my meditation and was hit with a lot of anxiety. I backed off from 30min 2 x day, to 15min 2 x day. This helped. Over the past month I have noticed I am stagnating, my practice does not seem to improve, my work and goals are suffering.  I recently started reading about ADHD and I can identify with so many of the issues. While I read and I identify, I tell myself "Is this the "new" thing to put my focus on ?". It seems like I am in a giant "thought loop"(term I learned from psychedelic users,,defined as a repeated pattern of thought, can be both short term ex) 3 seconds, or long term ex) every 2 weeks). My thought loop would be defined as having to constantly shift my focus of main interest. While I can devote adequate attention to these new things, my mind is 90% distracted all day at work. 1 out of 10 hours I would say I am in the "zone".  ADHD, alcoholism, depression, etc are all these labels that we created. We seek out what our "problems" are and hold onto the label, making it part of our "identity", whatever that means.  In short, is this ADHD nothing more than another distraction ?  EDIT:  I want to add that I am not downplaying ADHD, as someone posted in /r/mediation.  I also want to point out that some people would not be able to sit for 15 minutes with ADHD.  I can sit still easily, however it is my mind jumping around every 3-5 seconds that gets tiresome.  also posted in /r/meditation

I met her at an all day class we had to take.  As soon as she sat down she announced to the instructor, whom she knew, that she was "personalizing" her table tent name tag. She put a little sticker on it.  I said "Do you always carry stickers around with you?" And she said, "I do. I take notes like a five year old!"  I asked her what she meant, and she brought her notebook over to show me. It was really wild in a wonderful way. She uses crayons to mark headings and emphasize things. She has a buttload of stickers like "Wow!" and fruits and such, and she's categorized how she uses them.   Stuff she has to pay attention to later has a "WOW!" sticker next to it. She showed me how she differentiates days in her notebook, by putting an apple sticker next to a new day's worth of notes. "You know, like an apple a day..." she said.  She writes on Post-It notes and then puts them in the notebook, using stickers on the bottom corners to keep them in place.  I asked her how she came up with this, and that's when she told me she had Asperger's and when she was a child her parents sent her to a tutor or specialist who taught her how to take notes creatively to keep her focused. I couldn't help but wonder if maybe my parents had done the same thing I'd be as good at taking notes as she is.  She said her desk looks like an elementary school exploded but you know what? She keeps great notes and can keep track of her stuff!  I was at WalMart this weekend and got caught up in the back to school section. [I found a packet of her stickers there, something like 1500 for a few bucks.](http://imgur.com/Whgdlub) I bought one for myself and another one to give her on Monday.   She's also inspired me to get back into coloring mandalas. I meant to do it meditatively but I hated crayons. She told me about watercolor pencils so I bought some at WalMart and [this is what I've done so far this weekend.](http://imgur.com/WtlD2zZ)  Does any of this help ADHD? Maybe, maybe not, but I can't help but feel that working to unleash the creativity that I had to squash as a kid in order to become an adult might help make me happier...  Just wanted to share!
fa0f749f2a663adb7bba493ea770f99b234fbc5c3a63b42f25849e2d1cbb5e34;;;Picking a career path.;;;WARNING: WALL OF TEXT  Hey guys, I'm finally sitting down and writing this. I'm a (kinda) normal 20 year old college student in Los Angeles. I like the usual redditor stuff: video games, TV series, puppies, kittens, hiking, nature, foood, etc.   This past year I've been taking care of a family friend who happens to be a retired psychologist. I do things like do her shopping and drive her to her doctor appointments. Its an easy "job" but tbh, its unbelievably boring and over the past few months she's been kinda noticing that my enthusiasm has been lacking. She would periodically ask me if I liked the job and I would always respond with "Yeah, I'm just kinda stressed out right now" and bs like that. I stayed because I needed the extra spending money and I felt like she was one of the very few people who I could speak to about my personal problems. Stuff about my self-diagnosed general anxiety disorder and ADHD.   To move on the important stuff, I quit the job like a month ago because I couldn't handle the stresses of college + my other job (Office Depot). Before I left I asked if she could maybe shed her thoughts on my thoughts. We sat down and discussed some stuff she learned about me over the past year. To keep things short, she's confident that I do have an anxiety problem and that I do have ADHD.   You have no idea how relieved I was to hear that coming from a psychologist. Suddenly, I wasn't crazy. "I really DO have legitimate problems!". Not that I was going to give up on bettering myself, but it felt like weights had been lifted off of me. I felt lighter, and whenever I would feel anxious and/ or I couldn't concentrate or finish something, instead of taking it out on my self esteem, I would think about how this is common for people with _____, and what I can do to work with it.  My problem now is regarding my future and career path. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I WANT TO DO. I've had a dozen hobbies since I can remember. There was a period where all I did was film and edit skate videos and short films-- I gave up on that. There was also a time where I would blog about tech-- gave up on that. Trumpet-- gave up on that. Guitar, keyboard, fl studio, ukulele, basketball, football-- also gave up on all that. I can't stick with anything (sometimes not even video games). My question is: For the people who have set career goals or who have careers already... how? When did you decide that was what you wanted to do?   Thanks for reading, guys.   TL;DR  If I can't stick with one hobby, how am I supposed to pick a career?
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Recently diagnosed, having a hard time keeping up with classes as a full time student. Would it be bad if I got a full time job and started taking classes for my degree part time?;;;School has been really stressing me out lately. I got diagnosed 3 weeks ago as having very severe ADD, it had gone undiagnosed until I was nearly 22. I struggled immensely on a full-time schedule, passing some classes and failing others, stubbornly retaking several that I had failed just to keep moving forward before I took a medical leave for a year and got diagnosed.         I left my 4 year school with transfer credits, am getting a 2 year degree in chemistry as either a means to an end for me to start a job as a Histology Tech after enrolling in a cert program, or a decent starting point if I change my mind in the future. As it stands I really want to be done with school though. I hate it. I know I will like being a Histology Tech because I was doing that job as part of a research group in my 4 year degree and loved it, so I am really trying to make it there. I am mostly done, just have a sequence of physics, chemistry and calculus left to graduate.      These classes are obviously math-intensive and take an immense amount of concentration and tutoring for me to succeed in. I passed calculus already, but I am taking it again because that was 2 years ago. It is still just as hard relearning it as the first time. Still, I take it as consolation that I can succeed in this degree path as long as I go forward correctly.       Anyways, I have been finding increasingly that I do sub-par when I combine these classes in my schedule, even with medication. I just don't feel like I have enough time to properly address the work needed for each class. I pass some classes while failing others, when I could have simply broken up my course and done much better on the courses I barely passed. This pattern of failure tanks my self-esteem and gives me intense anxiety. I have been pressured to stay full-time by my parents, and also because I have Tricare which goes away once I stop being a full-time student.    But I really believe I would be happier if I was allowed to find a full time job, get a shitty one room apartment, hopefully pick up a different health insurance, and tackle these classes one at a time while taking out student loans. I have no loans so far, so I do have that going for me. Is this a realistic thought process and plan, though?       I worked tedious full time jobs minimum wage jobs over previous summers, and do not find work overwhelming. It is just my classes that I struggle managing time for, organizing for, studying for and retaining information for. I am seriously starting to doubt I will be able to graduate continuing as I am. I am miserable in college as things stand, and some days being so far set back in terms of graduation from my same-aged friends despite being full-time makes me damn near suicidal. (I do talk to people for that, merely thought it was relevant emotional information to share).    Looking for help and advice for my situation, even if it isn't what I want to hear.      Edit: I also feel it relevant to add that before going on medication I tried other coping mechanisms. I went to presentations about organized study habits offered from my college, and went through a course of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for anxiety and ADD and coping with that through school. I still feel overwhelmed going full time though, even with those coping mechanisms coupled with medication. I am also on 10mg extended release, though with midterms I  have been taking half of a 10mg instant release in the afternoons (broken up into two doses, for a total of 5 mg instant. One quarter then the other in 2-4 hours) and am feeling better.

Despite my student's shaky foundation in maths, he is incredibly enthusiastic and I would like to do as much as I can to help him achieve his dream of becoming an engineer.   I am currently studying a health care-related course so I've learned a fair bit about the science surrounding ADHD but I would like to hear about your personal experiences and advice on what helped you study. (I have also read the posts listed [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/17uf60/adhd_alltime_bestof_and_faq_thread_no_karma/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/21rvcg/these_studying_tricks_ive_made_up_are_the_only/) so far but I would like the opportunity to engage in discussions and receive constructive criticism on the strategies I've employed so far.)  I've tried to list the details in dot point so it's (hopefully) not too overwhelming.  **Background of student**  * 16 year old male student  * diagnosed with ADHD in January this year * Medication: Ritalin. 2 tablets in the morning, 1 in the afternoon.  * Takes the morning tablets routinely, sometimes forgets in the afternoon * Loves the guitar and gives lessons once a week. * His inability to focus in previous years has lead to a shaky foundation in basic mathematics - algebra.  **His strong points**  * Enthusiastic and willing to ask questions at school and with me. (His teachers comment that his face lights up when he understands a concept in class!) * He is determined to do well in maths and physics.  * He is great at questions requiring reasoning and picks up the associated concepts with ease e.g. geometry, trigonometry.   **My concerns**   * While he understands concepts in isolation, he has a huge problem identifying patterns in questions and their subsequent application e.g. difference of two squares.   * e.g. expanding x^2 - y^2 is no problem but if I ask him to rationalise the denominator of 1/(√3 + 1), he will not automatically remember to use the same method.  * He is on the slow side when it comes to mental arithmetic.  * He has days where he feels 'grumpy' and does not take well to doing set homework.   * Poor exam technique e.g. spends lots of time on questions offered few marks and too little on bigger questions. Often gives up when feeling overwhelmed  **Strategies that have been put into place**  * Since his first exam, I have had a sit down with him to improve his exam technique, including how questions are marked and the structure of exam questions.  * I have helped him set up a weekly schedule to match his school timetable (week A and week B) and account for equal hours of study to each subject, recreational time, etc.  * His teacher at school is also the head teacher of Mathematics and so she and I are working on a two-part support system to boost his maths skills throughout this year.    * His paediatrician has recommended dropping one subject once he reaches year 12 so that he can focus on fewer subjects. There is also the option of retaking the final maths and physics exams after an extra year of study if his marks are not adequate.   * His parents enforce a no-computer after dinner policy but dinner time can be variable.  * They also enforce a system whereby he and his sister take the dog for a walk after they come back from school to help him wind down.  **Strategies I am considering**  I was finally able to meet up with his teacher today and will be changing up my lesson plan.   Previously, I used to provide homework help, revise concepts he did not understand and push ahead with concepts so that it would click for him in class.   I have been assured that his teacher would be happy to take on this role so I now have an hour and a half per week to use as I see fit.  * I am thinking of solely focusing on algebra and mental calculation to improve his efficiency at solving problems.  * Due to his weak computational skills, I am considering starting him on the Kumon method. My mother used this for me back in the day and I feel that it would be useful when gathering like terms, etc instantaneously.  Thank you for reading this and I greatly appreciate your feedback.  TL;DR My student is very behind in maths and I'd like to tailor my lessons to suit him. Were there any study strategies that helped you through high school?  Edit: I've also just read [this link](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1a8n55/studying_tipshelp/c8v4qgy) and am trying to figure out how to devise a method of enforcing this.

I'm still a freshman.   When I'm in school nothing ever makes sense or clicks or anything. I'm sitting there and the teacher gives us our lecture for the day, I only really remember a few things, classes are an hour long the teacher will talk for about 30-50 minutes and give us our work. I think one of my main things is that it's almost impossible for me to focus on what there saying, trying to process it all, and just take it in and *learn* like how everyone in my classes are. It's also really embarrassing when everyone around you is getting B's and A's and you get B's and A's very rarely and its mostly F's D's and C's.  It's unbelievably frustrating cause you try and try and when you get the paper back to you with an F on it. It's one of the worst feelings when you try and it's still not good enough. Eventually I stopped trying because there was no fucking point. But I can't say that because I *need* an education to get a job and be independent.  But one of the biggest problems in school for me is that I can't focus at all. I talked to my parents about it, that one second I'm listening to the teacher and next thing I know she's/he's been talking for ten minutes and the whole time I was thinking about random things. So they told to just try as hard as I possibly can into focussing in what they are teaching and to ask for help when I don't understand. So I would sit down in class and the bell rings meaning class has started and the usual happens, just like any school. An introduction for the day, the teacher talks about what were going to be learning throughout the week and the topic for today.   Then next thing I know I realize I'm back into my own mind thinking about whatever, and I snap out of it go ok, I need to focus just like my parents said. Focus. So I start like staring at the teacher trying as hard as I can to focus on what they are talking about and trying to store the information in my head and listen to them at the same time. Then when I catch myself starting to drift off into my head I tell myself NO, I need to focus! Then all that I can focus on is trying to focus which distracts me from focussing.   And so focussing wasn't working for me that became obvious so I would ask my teacher for help during the last 10-20 minutes of class on the assignments. Basically they would have to start over from the beginning and go step by step on how to do whatever it is I'm doing in that class. The second I started feeling things start to "click" and make sense, it's an amazing feeling. Your actually learning! Then you go home feeling confident and almost even excited to start your work, then you open it up and it looks like hieroglyphics all over again.   Anyways I just ended up getting so desperate to just be able to listen to a person talk for a full half and hour without only hearing ten minutes of what they talked about. I was talking about it to one of my friends who is diagnosed with ADHD and he gets prescribed 20mg of XR adderall, and he gave me one before school and said it might help. That was the best day of my life.   I was energetic, I was awake, I was even WANTING to be in that class room right there in that moment of time. I wasn't wishing for the bell to ring so I can just move on. I was able to listen and pay attention. Things were clicking, stuff was *actually* making sense. I was literally motivated to do my work and to listen, because this time I could! I wasn't spacing out every few minutes. It was an odd feeling, the only way I can describe is I wasn't necessarily excited about school and assignments, but it wasn't dreadful and stressful. The fact that I was understanding things made me so happy I just wanted more and more of my teacher to talk about biology, math, english, or health or whatever. It was pretty awesome.   Idk... I don't even know if this is the right place to post this, but I might as well. Basically I am wondering if what I said makes any sense or if anyone can relate to it. I haven't ever really talked to anyone about it and I thought it would be cool and even help to talk to someone who gets it. The biggest thing is focussing. It sounds simple to just literally listen, but its so hard somehow. And not even just in school it's anywhere but it mostly matters in school, then when I get a job. I just feel stuck and helpless and this is the first time I've had hope in a while about school.   It's 4:30 in the morning so sorry if I went off topic or something sounded weird. I just really want to get the chance to talk to someone on here that might understand me or can relate to me, cause no one really gets it and it's insanely frustrating.  **EDIT**: And what I mean from the title, is like this is the first time I've been able to not just drift on into my own head and feel so stuck inside my head. I can let other people in and listen to what they say, and learn things so much better. But since adderall was the only thing I've actually even tried idk if theres something even better or if I'm just not even in the place to post this. And if I'm not please don't just downvote and move on, I would ask if you could at the least comment or pm me or whatever with something. Idk I'm just getting really desperate.

But for once in my life, I'm happy. It just seems like things are coming into place.  My meds help me stay focused  I'm happier, and a bit more confident in myself   It's just incredibly overwhelming. I was only diagnosed this year, but my whole life I knew there was something off. I just felt different. And to finally have things coming into place? Shit. I cry just thinking about this. I can't even hold my composure if I think about how far I've come.   If anyone is still struggling to get their meds figured out, hang in there. I've been through some seriously hard times, but I'm glad to say I'm seeing things get better.   Sorry I don't have much else to offer in this post. I just wanted to share my feelings, most people don't understand when I tell them how much better I'm doing now.

(I haven't been close with someone who's diagnosed before, so I'm really new to everything I'm learning.  Please correct me if I say something wrong.)  She's on medication and functions extremely well (good grades, grad school professors love her, successful at her job, etc), but I'm wondering how her diagnosis might affect us as a couple in the long term.  I'm looking for tips on what I can do both to be supportive to her, AND any relationship pitfalls I should know to recognize as the disorder.  For example:  she's incredibly attentive when we're in the same city, but when she's out of town, her communication style varies widely.  Sometimes I'll get 6 Snapchats from her in a row, or have hour-long text conversations.  Sometimes I don't hear from her for almost all day.  This is new for me; I'm used to more consistent patterns of communication.  It occurred to me last night that maybe this is part of the disorder.  Is it?  Has anyone had a partner tell them they do this?  TL;DR Give someone without ADD/ADHD some tips for dating someone with it!

With the concerta I can actually focus on task IF I actually can get started with them. I have used some techniques to help me but they never last longer than 3-4 days before I stop using them (huzzah for no foresight.) but even when I am using the techniques I still find it hard to actually get started on homework and projects. (Although I find it easy to do tasks that have been issued to me one at a time or on a written list.) I guess what i am really asking is how do I stick to the techniques so I can actually do the work that I am required to be a self starter on.   TL;DR   * Use techniques for a short time , doesn't help me.  * can focus but not a self-starter.  * hurting academic performance/potential   Edit:formatting

799466ef3cd6c3346d1a79966e0763bd0712a088dd59e82937d4e9d88d44670e;;;Recently diagnosed with ADHD-PI for the first time, but I'm concerned about my initial prescription;;;So to start with, I'm a 24yo male. Like many of you, I've had problems throughout my life focusing on the tasks at hand. I have the tendency to get hyper obsessed something for a few weeks to a few months, then lose interest and move on to something else. During that time, though, I have a hard time focusing on anything that's not related to this weeks obsession.  I did alright in grade school due to the structure, but once I got into college I started failing classes left and right. I am smart, and I typically did well to start with, but eventually I would just stop turning in the assignments and had a hard time paying attention. I've always been bad with remembering events and dates, but lately it seems like it's been really bad. I was describing some of this to a friend of mine who'd been diagnosed with ADHD as a kid, and he suggested that I may have the disorder. He gave me some adderall to try and see how it worked out. I tried it and  wow, what a difference. I felt like I had actual energy all of a sudden, not just the twitchy pent-up energy I was used to. Also, I finally had the motivation to actually get things done that I've been wanting to do. When at work, I was able to stay focused all day and not lose my attention to reddit or other distractions like I normally would throughout the day.  I went to go see a psychiatrist and was totally honest with him about my life and symptoms, and he diagnosed me with inattentive-type ADHD. Here's the part that has me concerned though, he said I had a mild case of ADHD-PI and then prescribed me 20mg of adderall 3x daily! Even from just the reading I'd done for the couple of days before then, I knew that was a lot. I asked him if he was sure, and he said yes, that's an "adult dose". Before then, I'd only taken adderall for a few days, and never took more than 10mg twice a day. I took the prescribed dosage the next day and it messed me up bad. Yeah, I was ON POINT all day long, but I couldn't sleep at all that day or the next. I took a break over the weekend and started back today again at 10mg x2. I feel better, but I'm still feeling the negative effects of that dosage.  I'm wondering if maybe the psychiatrist I saw thought I was just there to get adderall, and not because I genuinely believed I have ADHD? I know a lot of people get prescriptions just to use it recreationally, and they'll lie to get diagnosed, but that's not my intention at all. 60mg a day is a huge dose, and I'd think that if he was doing it to save me money or so I'd have more medication then he'd have at least let me know to only take 5-10mg at a time 2-3 times a day to start, and not start me at such a huge dosage.  Have any of you had similar experiences with psychiatrists? Do you think it'd be worth it to talk to another phych? Also, I'm not sure how I should approach my current psychiatrist about the dosage he gave me. Another big factor is that I don't have insurance. The initial visit with this doctor cost me $165, and subsequent check-ins are $75 a piece. I do save a lot of money by getting larger quantities/dosages that I can split, rather than getting smaller pills, so I wouldn't want to have to buy more of a smaller pill and pay a ton of money. Also, If I were to see another doctor I'd have to pay their first time visit fee as well, which would be similar (probably more) than what I already had to pay as the first time fee for my current psychiatrist.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I feel fantastic that I've finally got a face for the disorder that's plagued me my whole life, and I don't feel like I'm just a naturally lazy and unmotivated person anymore. I finally feel like there's something that can be done to get myself feeling normal, I just want to make sure I'm doing the right thing and not setting myself up for failure already.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Iv'e never been able to describe this feeling properly, but i'll try here.;;;Since i was a kid this feeling used to trigger when i sat in class and my entire manner of perception would shift....for instance, the teacher at the head of the class room would seemingly become further away and smaller, yet at the same time it would seem as though i could touch him. Was weird, because it was like i was far away an close at the same time.  Other dualistic things like this would take place, like when i felt my desk, i would feel how hard it is but in my imagination imagine it to be as soft as cotton. This would just automatically happen. It was a strange sensation, as though i was sensing hardness and softness at the same time.  I have since learned how to trigger this feeling, it's and odd method but when there's enough sunlight around me and im talking to another  person, if i close my right eye it happens. I've been made extremely uncomfortable by this aswell as had overwhelming realizations of peace.  When this happens, it's like my brain is trying to find the difference between two contrasting ideas (hard/soft) (close/far) then ends up putting them both together so i experience them at the same time. I also feel very distant from "myself" when this happens.   Am i alone on this?
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Finally met with a psychologist at my university. Tomorrow is my first appointment with a psychiatrist. What should I expect?;;;I was able to get in with a psychologist today to discuss whether or not I may have adhd. After the assessment he scheduled me to meet with a psychiatrist tomorrow. What should I do to prepare for tomorrow? Should I expect to be clinically diagnosed with adhd tomorrow? or does it take multiple visits for proper diagnosis? What are the chances that the psychiatrist will prescribe me medication after tomorrows appointment? ugh I'm so anxious for an answer to this mess. Id appreciate any feedback and I encourage you to share your experiences with diagnosis/getting treatment through the university. Thanks guys :)  **UPDATE: Met with the psychiatrist. He upped my zoloft dose to 100mg (I was initially taking 50mg). He said I do show mild symptoms of add, but he is reluctant to prescribe me stimulants just yet; he emphasized that he doesn't want me to get hooked on them and also is concerned about the long term affects it has on the brain. However he is open to the idea of prescribing me something, but not just yet. He thinks that my depression and mild anxiety may be the cause of my add symptoms, hence why he upped the dose. My next visit is in 2 weeks, so hopefully by then we will be closer to determining my treatment options.

And where did you go to get tested?  I am 20 years old and convinced that I have it. It all started last semester in college. My roommate is a psychology major and he was learning about frontal lobe function and disorders. He told me about this game called The Tower of Hanoi (look it up if you don't know what it is). He said that an inability to solve the puzzle within a certain amount of moves could indicate a frontal lobe problem. I played the game and it took me 240 moves to solve it with 6 rings. The optimal amount of moves to solve it is around 60.I tried again and again with similar results so it wasn't just a bad first try. This is what first concerned me because of how badly I performed.  A few months later I'm still a little concerned but have mostly forgotten about it. Then I go to Charlestown, SC with my buddies and my job was to keep track of the camera bag. I failed miserably and left it behind three times in various places. I did some googling and figured out that ADD/ADHD is a disorder of the frontal lobe.  This got me thinking about it again and I've realized that I am very forgetful, chronically late to everything, I find it very hard to concentrate while reading or listening to conversation, I find it hard to finish projects, am a super procrastinator, and am constantly misplacing things. My parents tell me I'm lazy and irresponsible. I think back to the time when I figured out I needed glasses. I didn't notice that my vision was bad until someone told that I should be able to see the projector from the second row of desks and I got glasses. I don't want something like ADD to hold me back unnecessarily because I'm not diagnosed, like when i got glasses. What do I do?   tl;dr I think I have ADD/ADHD what is the next step?

When I hear unexpected or random repeated sounds it is all I can think about.  I also seem to hear very quiet noise that others cannot.  My upstairs neighbors let their television drone for over 2/3 of the day.  I spent  1-2 months sitting in my room in agony over the constant, low bass bleeding through my ceiling.  This ultimately lead to me seeking help and being unofficially diagnosed.  I cannot break the lease or move into another room in the same complex.  I have several months left here.  I have asked the neighbors to lower the volume.  I have resorted to contacting the landlord.  I wear headphones 90% of the time I am awake.  I have a box fan on the highest setting.  The bass still bleeds in.  I have to be awake from 2 a.m. until I leave for the office if I want to work / read / whatever in peace.  I do not know what to do.  I am posting this here because I believe my noise sensitivity is related to my condition.  Has anyone else encountered this situation?  Does anyone have irregular suggestions for drowning out this noise?
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Just a few questions about Adderall and focus;;;I've managed to make my way through life doing just about everything at the last minute, and after reading up on ADHD and finding it to be almost diagnosis-accurate to how my life has been as early as I can remember, finally decided that I'm not going to get my way through this final year of grad school and actually be able to improve myself without additional help beyond the lifestyle and study management skills I've tried to develop in the last couple of years. I saw a couple of specialists and got my Adderall prescription last week.  However, I'm having trouble placing the effects the drug has had on my motivation and ability to focus, so I'd just like to throw out everything I've experienced so far and see if I can get some suggestions from people on how to optimize. I'm going to describe my experiences in the next two paragraphs and then ask a few more concrete questions, for which I thank anybody with relevant experiences or knowledge who'd be willing to help me get on track :).  I started out at my doctor's recommendation taking 5mg (half a pill) twice a day, and didn't feel much distinguishable from the placebo effect (which is to say, there may have been and probably were subtle differences in my state, but nothing I could pin down). However, at 10mg twice a day, I feel slightly different. When I read I feel like my eyes aren't jumping around the page so much and I'm not having to subvocalize in order to internalize the information. I haven't felt the feeling of well-being some describe, but I do feel that perhaps it's a little easier for me to do small things, like add something I need to remember to my schedule rather than trying to remember it, or feel less anxious about the possibility of going to bed before I've driven myself so tired that I can go right to sleep without the usual descent of the dark cloud of anxiety.  Regarding the anxiety—it feels less conscious (worries about concrete things), and I've mostly stopped grinding my teeth or engaging in nervous tics like pen-twirling or as much knee-bobbing by default. I do however note that I feel a little tenser in my baseline; my temples are just a little tenser than they might normally be and, mercifully, I don't feel like falling asleep anytime I'm sitting in a lecture or really just taking it easy for more than a few minutes. I think I feel slightly more excited about finally dedicating myself to learning guitar, reading more fiction, and keeping more on top of my work, though I haven't necessarily started doing this yet. Anyway, I've actually started taking only one 10mg pill a day in the morning, because I feel like the effects might be lasting long enough to get me through that horrible lethargic morning period. At the same time, I'm not necessarily getting more done or feeling a strong drive to accomplish things and clean up and whatnot, which may be more of a consequence of ingrained patterns and habits than some weakness of the drug (it's not a magic pill after all).  Anyway, my questions:  * Does my experience sound fairly normal? I ask this though because I've heard about that "feeling of wellbeing" and motivational drive that people on Adderall report experiencing at first, indicating that they're on the right dose even if it doesn't last forever. Am I well within the range of normal experience for people starting Adderall even if I haven't experienced this feeling or a definite change in raw motivation? I can still blow an entire day without really realizing it, but I think I feel less despondent and anxious by the numerous self and externally-imposed unfinished tasks in my life, maybe less bombarded by thoughts and little impulses, like a feeling of being "anchored" to whatever I'm doing and not wanting to change it, which sometimes make task completion more difficult. For example, I might still be lazy or unmotivated, but I feel less driven to refresh the same subreddits over and over. I had a mild to moderate diagnosis of ADHD on various metrics, and would be open to the idea that I should be on more than 10mg once or twice a day. How does your experience match?  * I still feel like absolute shit when I wake up in the morning, but once I wake up I don't feel consumed by the desire to sleep until about 3 or 4 pm when my brain and body used to wake up until at late as I could stay up in the morning.  Is this about right? If this effect were all I was experiencing (and it's the only one I can really pin down as being different since I started taking the pill), I think I'd be more than happy to keep it.  * I'm in my late 20s and have some pretty ingrained bad habits and procrastination right now, so I wonder if it's more a matter of the medication helping me to have the energy to follow my plans and set goals and improve and whatnot than a sudden influx in motivation that some report upon starting Adderall. Is that right? I still feel, for example, a feeling of restlessness when locked into a conversation with somebody, but also don't feel that all-consuming distraction by the idea that I might hear a noise around me or have somebody speak to me. Some things feel a little different, but a few of the key things that made me a wreck feel a little better.  Thanks, and sorry that my questions ended up as rambly as my description. I always overexplain myself medically, so thanks to anyone who's willing to parse this and give me a response :).

2baa434521b3fd53a9dd793628769ed68d284c3c941e15defe3717fd34067f8d;;;In the process of getting a diagnosis, dealing with a lot of frustration;;;I am a 20 year old female studying biology at a small liberal arts college. In the past year or so I've noticed some issues at home, work, and school. I have an extremely tough time focusing on schoolwork, I feel absolutely restless,  I put things off until the absolute last minute, blah blah blah. Well when I initially notice it, I just thought I was tired or feeling lazy. After getting more sleep and pushing myself harder to study, everything turned to crap. At the end of the fall semester I found out that I had failed o-chem, gotten a D+ in an essential bio class, and recieved mediocre C's in the rest of my classes. The thing is that I wasn't devastated. I had expected it entirely.  Fast forward to Christmas break. I take the month to relax and recuperate from the hellish semester I just went through. I still have these feelings of procrastination, distraction, and a lack of will power. My first thought is to get some blood work done to see if there is anything wrong, and if it comes back clean I'll start seeing a therapist again (I didn't have insurance at the time). My blood work comes back clean as I suspected, so I push myself yet again to stay positive and try to fix things myself with organization techniques and whatnot. Well a week into winter break my bf and I moved into an apartment, and since he works full-time it was up to me to clean the place up and put everything away. I dreaded it so much that I would find a thousand other small things to do to before unpacking any boxes or putting anything away. This put a strain on our relationship, but for the most part he sucked it up and I tried my best.   Starting Spring semester, I start a new part-time job as a scribe in the ER. I'm so excited because it's in my area of interest for a career, and I can't wait to learn the ropes. Balancing work and school is tough, but I deal with it the best I can meaning I barely make it in any of my classes. I end the semester with an F in another essential bio class, a mediocre C in anatomy, and A's and B's in the rest of my classes, which are basically blow-off/fluff classes. Meanwhile, I still haven't seen a therapist because I'm in such denial, but once summer starts, I call the office and make an appointment. Also, I start compulsively shopping which also contributed to getting in her office ASAP.  I tell my therapist all that is going on, and she tells me to go to my family physician and talk to her first. I comply, and after talking to my PCP for about five minutes (she was two hours late to the office), she writes me a precription for 25 mg Adderall XR. I leave her office feeling confused because I know that there has to be more of a screening than what just happened, especially because the area I live in has a huge issue with prescription drug abuse in the community. I reassure myself that it's fine because she's a doctor, and she knows what she's doing. Wrong. Obviously my insurance wants documentation of an ADD/ADHD diagnosis, and my doctor can't provide it because she didn't so anything. So I just wasted a month (June) trying to get help. I go back to my doctor for a follow up appointment to see how I'm tolerating the Adderall, and is shocked that the insurance company didn't give the prescription the green-light. She then asks me what kind of documentation they want besides what she gave them, and I tell her that they need proof of a screening. She looks completely bewildered at this point and asks me what a screening entails exactly, and I have no clue how to answer that. She's the medical professional, and she isn't providing me any other resources to turn to. I am beyond frustrated after leaving her office, and feel entirely hopeless. Later that day I have an appointment with my therapist, and she says that she can refer me to someone, but it'll be another 2-3 weeks before I can see them. I had no issue with that, so she told me she get back to me with the info after I fill out a packet and send it back in. That's basically where I am now. I sent the packet in about two days ago and currently awaiting a response. I'm just so frustrated because it took a lot to admit what I've been going through, and how much it's affected my life, and now that I'm actively seeking help it isn't going too well. I remain optimistic because I know that there is a process for a reason, and recreational abuse has driven it to this point. I just really want to make the changes necessary so I can function like a normal person. Lurking in this subreddit has made me feel like I'm not so alone, and honestly, a lot of the posts have made me reflect on what I've been trying to force away for so long. I guess what I'm asking for is how to stay optimistic when all I want to do is cry? I'm so frustrated with the whole thing, and every day presents a new set of struggles.  TL;DR In the process of getting diagnosed after having concentration/focus/compulsive issues for a year and a half.

So, I have been diagnosed as an adult, but I think I have "ADHD lite" or coping mechanisms that as long as my mental health is otherwise strong, pretty much makes life manageable. I take 10-20 micrograms of adderall every now and then, as needed... but not regularly.   I just started keto the other day (for weight loss) and realized that since I have started, I feel almost the same ability to focus and stability that the adderall gives me. I know I have seen posts relating to this in the past, but haven't found any scholarly/science-based posts/articles on this. Is it a "thing?" Is it just placebo?   I obviously don't think it's a substitute for medication or anything, but have been shocked at how it has improved my mood, focus, and how stable I feel. In a way it makes sense (blood sugar highs and lows certainly effect mood... but concentration?)... but I don't know if it is all in my head...  Thanks!

Sometimes I drink coffee which completely boost the bejeezes out of it and makes me feel like beethoven or something.       *2.*Anyways, I'm 18 and have a job as an IT coop and I want to go to college for computer science, I kind of what to do something white hat or to do with developing for phones. When I was in kindergarten I tested a 136 IQ and was labeled an abstract thinker or something? I failed most school and around 10th grade summer I started smoking pot which kept the failure going until second semester of my senior year where I got pissed off at how my life was going and quit, and got straight A's on my very last report card (woop).       *3.*I usually listen to music at work while I'm working on computer problems, I kind of coincide the music with my work so it cant be any music, I don't know how to describe it but songs with a beat like 5 bass thumps every 2 or so seconds kind of send like this weird focus, I kind of click to the bass and type to the treble and get this weird rythmatic fusion going? It's pretty weird. I quit going to my nuerologist because he overbooked his office and threw drugs at me to get the meeting over quickly (I was childhood friends with his son too so I can't imagine how he treated other people) My family doctor gives me prescriptions for the medication that worked at a lower dosage than the nuerologist gave me.       *4.*One more thing, I was really good at geometry and algebra as long as I'm like in the groove and focused but when it became overbearing my brain gave out and I couldnt focus and just played doodle jump and shit. When I got to adv algebra and trig I was trying my hardest but like, I don't know if it was enough. I didn't take math my senior year. So I guess my concern/question is do you guys think I can do a degree in computer science? Could I ever do something that requires that much intelligence and diligence?       BONUS. Fun facts: *1.* My brain has high alchohol tolerence and Low THC tolerance (relax I do neither anymore, but I plan to drink when it's legal for me) I had petit mal seizures when I was younger, I'm pretty sure I had one once when I smoked pot one time      *2.*I had undiagnosed depression until halfway through grade 12 from the end of 10th. Started with being cheated on by my 2 year girlfriend and having like super low self esteem, My doctor diagnosed me and gave me those zombie meds, quit taking them and kind of got pissed off at depression and then it went away after realizing I'm an alright guy.      *3.*My hand writing sucks balls      *4.*The only music I don't actively listen to is country polka and folk.      *5.*I got fired from a coney island      *6.*My mother conceived me on birth control and antibiotics      *7.*I had panic attacks for awhile until I started pot, and since I've quit they haven't really picked back up, probably because I learned to calm the F*ck down haha.

When I was in high school people thought that they were better than me because their grades were amazing and I'd be lucky if I even scraped a pass. They looked at me like I was retarded, and on the rare occasion I studied and did better than them, they'd used to say stuff like, "I can't believe *she* did better than me".  I'm so sick of feeling like I can't accomplish anything because of literally being told my whole life that I would never accomplish anything.  I have so much work to complete by the end of the year. A normal person would be able to do it, but I don't feel that I can. I have no one in my life who actually cares for me other than my parents, and even then their love is conditional that I do well in my studies.  **TL;DR I guess you could say I'm looking for someone to chat with and support me. I have no life and only probably go out once a week. I want someone who understands what living with ADHD is like. I'd like someone who's online most of the time. I'm very needy, socially awkward, and not the best person right now... I hope talking to someone or having some sort of "friend" who can motivate me will help with my work.**

For the past month or so I have not been able to fill my prescriptions in any pharmacy in my area.  Luckily, for me it is not debilitating to my social life and only prevents me from being optimally productive.  However, there are others who are severely affected by the adderall shortage. *How are regulators preventing it from getting into the hands of patients with prescriptions written by legitimate doctors? *How are we going to change the regulations that create these sporadic shortages like the adderall shortage of 2011? *How long will it be until the pharmacies in my area receive adequate supplies of adderall?  **Testimonies of Adderall's importance ** &gt; * sorry the picking fights with my significant other (the one who MADE me get on Adderall) only happens when I don't take my medication. &gt;* I take generic Adderall 20 mg for narcolepsy and there is not one local pharmacy that has it in stock. I have never had this problem before.  &gt;* Do these people at the drug co. realize the affect that this can have on our daily life and more importantly our body? So, they must expect us all to detox off the medicine on our own and then all of a sudden get right back on it in January. Your body will have to become accustomed to the medication all over again.

I feel like i would just be wasting taking it.
8057431c071663ddb4ced6acb347891ab6ea84456aa43bd98ec8eb470814dec1;;;Should I talk to my boss about my ADHD related problems?;;;Note: Right now I'm not officially diagnosed and have had to find a new psychiatrist because old one generally sucked and refused stimulants, however so far everyone has agreed with my symptoms being that of ADHD-PI   I am currently attending university working on my Ph.D. My problems in my past that were probably related to ADHD yet my professor was kind enough to take me in and keep me on a trial basis based on my performance.  The problem lies in that at the beginning of the summer I was tasked to write a review paper and to get some results on experiments and around the same time my previous psychiatrist wanted me to try wellbutrin (she was running me through non-stimulants for some reason). The wellbutrin had left me very unfocused and moody and when quitting it I felt incredibly depressed/unmotivated and its been 2 almost 3 months since I was tasked to work on this.  Reading papers feels like hell and I'm trying to trudge through it but it takes forever. I know I'm on my last limb and my professor has probably already already decided to not renew my contract as is. Is it advisable that I tell my adviser what my issues are and see if she will work with me or should I just keep trying my hardest and tell her I don't have the work done? Any advice would very much help.   TL;DR : Lots of procrastination in combination with psych refusal to give stimulants. Could lose job/school. Should I talk to professor about problem?
f3c8f57480130f86efa3067da4901fd256ea0347e399b385de5b335717aa1c0a;;;I met with a doctor who specializes in ADD/ADHD last week. He is a big proponent of a QEEG test to determine whether I actually have ADD and which type I have. My test is tomorrow. Is this a good diagnostic test, or a way for him to make some extra insurance money?;;;The questionnaire I had to fill out basically felt like I was reading my biography, and my wife said that there weren't high enough numbers on the form that she filled out for some of the questions about my behavior.  The doctor said he felt pretty sure about my diagnosis, but wanted to do the test to "be scientifically sure." I haven't had much time to do any research about a QEEG test for ADD, but I know it's a fairly new thing. Anyone have any feedback or advice or experience with this new way of diagnosing ADD?
b20e75b746b89a86ef70f8386a37754413b8d722e5afde4e864396424b1caeda;;;Short Essay about my ADHD Experience;;;This is a rough draft of a piece I am working on, tell me what you think!  ---------------  In October of 2013 I had one of the most epic meltdowns of my entire life. For completely freaking out, I was actually quite composed to the outside world, but I was constantly vibrating on the inside. I was walking around doing the best impression of the usual me, all the while it felt like my insides were being lightly squeezed by someone else’s hands. What set me off into this spiral of anxiety? I had realized that I had forgotten to write a test date into my disorganized excuse of a calendar, a test that I was unprepared for and that was scheduled to happen the next day. In my fourth year of university, after years of feeling like I was lazy and disorganized, I decided that maybe it was time to talk to someone.   I have always known that I probably would be diagnosed with ADHD if I went through with formal testing. In fact, in my final year of high school I started the testing process but gave up after enough people told me that since I had a high average it wasn’t worth my trouble. I passively agreed with everyone else, and even though studying was excruciating, I was clearly able to cope enough to excel at the time. The opinions of the people around me are what kept me from getting formally tested for another four years, only because (despite my many academic and personal accomplishments) I finally snapped. Alas, at the age of 21, after a lifetime of symptoms and red flags, a psychologist diagnosed me with Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder.   The diagnosis was a relief. I think that this is something a lot of individuals who are diagnosed with ADHD in early adulthood feel. The day before my diagnosis and the day after my diagnosis were probably exactly the same, and I am still the same person as before, but now I have a name that explains how my brain works. This is not an excuse as to why I operated in such an impulsive, yet disorganized way. Instead, it is an explanation. I now know what I was dealing with and can focus on management rather than letting the symptoms render me useless. The diagnosis gave me a platform to work from in order to make sure that I am being productive and putting my best self forward. It’s daunting, and working on the lifestyle changes that lessen the effects of my disorder sometimes feels impossible after many years of bad habits, but that is another story for another day.    The psychological symptoms that I have to deal with every day with ADHD is hard to manage not only because it causes my brain to move quicker than my mouth, but because lots of people don’t believe that it’s a real thing. Everyone has probably heard the arguments: “it’s just an excuse for laziness” or “our society makes us have ADHD, so stop watching TV.” These attitudes are what kept me from seeking support, and allows me to feel unease when I talk about my disorder openly. Both of these arguments place blame on my lack of mental strength; if most people are able to keep their minds in check despite our distracting environment, I should be able to as well. It’s sometimes hard not to feel like identifying myself as someone with ADHD is me admitting defeat, and that I don’t have the work ethic that others have. Even though I have been quite successful in what I do, and have many opportunities that others don’t, explaining that this has been difficult to accomplish still seems like a pity party.   Now I am medicated, an aspect of ADHD management that is often criticized, which reiterates the stigma. This is something I am afraid to talk openly about to anyone besides my closest friends, and even then I sometimes feel judgment. I am consistently left feeling as if I have given in where others haven’t, therefore the use of medication is just another indicator of my mental weakness. No matter how well the medication allows me to focus and get things done without anxiety, and how much my life has improved with a pill in the morning, my successes never seems to be justified because I need extra help to do it. When I take my medication I feel sane and ready to take on the world, something that most people have the ability to feel on their own. It is not like I am taking advantage of an option that not every has, becoming super human with every Adderall capsule. The medication is not making me work better than you, it’s bringing me to your level. Still, this is something that a lot of people still do not have the ability to understand or accept.   It is impossible for you to imagine how my mind works, just as it is impossible for me to understand how yours works. With respect to this notion, it is only fair to assume that someone with a mental illness or another psychiatric disorder is telling the truth. I know how my brain works better than you do. It quite honestly blows my mind that in a society that accentuates physical differences, we are unable to grasp the idea than our insides our different as well.  You may not agree with what I am saying, or that my way of dealing with my disorder is what you would do, it ultimately does not matter, because you are not me.    Ending the stigma surrounding mental illness and psychiatric disorders is not going to happen with just simple conversation. Although being as open as possible about whatever we are facing is important, this effort for open dialogue may be fruitless without a set of ears that are genuinely listening. In order to make progress, we have to step outside of our own minds and realize that not everyone is the same. I understand that this is sometimes difficult, but we must actively try and put ourselves in foreign shoes. If we can solidify that the differences between us do not need proof, the past version of me will reach out about his issues earlier than he did. That is, if he remembers to write it down in his calendar.   -----------  TL;DR - A short essay about my experience with ADHD diagnosis in adulthood, wondering if others had similar experiences or thoughts
0e0268c7c1dcfa5dcec1226ca438860ceeb54b08bf373b7a56c1f64ed044b147;;;I can't win. Ever. (Rant);;;I kick around here, but this post is using an alt, because my wife knows my user name.  I haven't been diagnosed for very long. It's been a couple months, but it's still hard.   I have had comorbid depression and anxiety for most of my life.   I've been married for a long time, and I'm afraid it's just played out.   Our whole relationship is just poison.  Today is her birthday, and I fucked the whole thing up.  Her sister and I planned a surprise party. I had a very limited time yesterday to use the car while my wife was out walking the dog. I went to the grocery store and got what I needed and went back home. Then I realized I forgot to get gas so I could mow the lawn. I went back out and got it, but I was running too late and she saw me with the gas can. She asked me what I was doing with it. I was stupid and said I was mowing the lawn. She told me not to, because she was going to do it Friday for a BBQ we're having. It went back and forth, and she wouldn't leave it.  I knew if I just did it later while she was out I was going to catch hell for not obeying her. (How fucked up is that? That I would be worried about her reaction to me doing a chore? It couldn't be viewed as a nice thing that I did without some sort of justification.)  I spilled the beans so she would stop arguing with me about mowing the lawn.  The next thing I know, according to her, the only reason I'm doing the whole thing is to hurt her. I would never do anything for her. I would never clean anything for her on my own, so I must be doing it all for reasons of manipulation.  I can't win. Ever. No matter how hard I try, shit just doesn't work out in my favor. I tried very hard to do something nice for my wife to show her I love her, and not only did it not work out, she actually believes I did it to be an asshole.  When she was yelling at me, she told me what a fucking monster I am. And that it would be really nice if I could go for 24 hours without having any "ADHD frustration" (Not what she said, she actually made a mocking full body expression).  There's obviously so much more, and it's just as complicated as life usually is.  The truth is she has no idea what a monster I am. She doesn't know what it's like to have to fight your own mind.  Yesterday I did my best to clean the whole house. I sobbed the whole time, I had to chant my tasks to myself over and over while I was doing them, because there was so much to do if I looked up and saw something else I needed to do I'd get distracted and confused about what I was trying to get done.  That shit isn't normal. I'm so broken.  I'm ready to crawl into my own hole with a bottle of liquor and a pack of smokes, and die in my own filth. (But I better not tell her, I only share my suicidal feelings with her to manipulate her.)  I don't know what to do. I'm just tired of hurting.

Having this medication has helped me tremendously! I got into the best physical shape of my life and made a career change for the better. I recently moved and my new doctor is not super thrilled about me taking Adderall, which apparently is the norm in the new state I live in. She recommended me to a neuropsychologist for adult ADHD screening so I get an "official" diagnosis from testing, and wants that doctor to prescribe me the medicine. It will take a few hours to test. I have no idea what this will entail. Has anyone gotten this testing done before? I have no doubt I have ADHD but I am just curious to what to expect.
d2ef74ca03855ec64f2efb639cb4b8ba27f74ed8bb76c47cd037ffdf7682042b;;;Funky symptoms on Vyvanse?;;;I started taking Vyvanse my Junior Year of High School (now a Junior in college) and I remember it worked wonders; great grades, got myself into Purdue University, was performing well at work, etc. I was up to 70 MG before I finally stopped my sophomore year of college because my schedule was just far too erratic to fit Vyvanse in anymore. My grades dropped tremendously (3.9 to a 2.6), I had trouble waking up or following any routines and all of these things led to a huge slump.  I'm now going into my junior year and I've started Vyvanse again at 30 MG, after realizing I cannot function between school and full-time work without it. I've been back on it for about a week. I'm having these horrible symptoms that I just don't remember having before. I'm shaky and insanely nervous, VERY, VERY irritable. I'm content sitting alone with something to work on, but when someone wants to talk to me or take away whatever it is I'm doing, I get livid for pretty much no reason. The worst symptom, though, is that I feel like I cannot get any air. It's that feeling you get when you have to yawn, except it's non-stop and when I do get relief it's short-lived.  Has anyone else had these symptoms/know how to cope with them? I'm worried that they won't clear up anytime soon and I'll be in a pickle. I've been diagnosed since I was 6 (now 20) and this is the only medication that hasn't made me go absolutely bonkers or depressed.  TL;DR: What were your weirdest symptoms on Vyvanse and how long did they take to clear up?
66addc7c173e152a6757f26042ba5242e28197fb6d52f7ce0fee8525e70d9f03;;;Undiagnosed and new to this subreddit, but ADHD might be the answer I've been searching for.;;;I don't even know where to begin. I guess they say symptoms emerge in childhood, and that's when people are typically diagnosed. I wasn't an overly hyper kid. I did really well in school, but I was always drawing, reading anything but school material, and constantly day dreaming. I suppose it went unnoticed because I lacked the physical hyperactivity associated with ADHD, but I definitely had the mental overactivity. I did fairly well in high school too, but not as good as in grade school because I lacked the discipline and attention span to really keep myself on track. Now that I'm in college, about to start my third year, and working an 8 to 5 desk job 30+ hours a week, I'm really starting to feel that something isn't right.   At first, I believed I suffered from anxiety and depression (which could still be true to an extent). I've been on 4 different antidepressants at varying doses and seeing a therapist regularly for almost 2 years now, and I still don't feel like I'm accomplishing all I'm capable of. It's not that I don't know or understand the things I'm supposed to be doing (like work right now), but I'm incapable of accomplishing what should be simple tasks.   The more I've been researching and reading about ADHD, the more I feel like this is what I'm suffering from. I'm meeting with my therapist later this week, and I'd like some advice about how to approach this subject with her. It's completely out of the blue; I've never even considered it because I always thought a person with ADHD had to be overly active. I'm only just now learning that there are different types and symptoms. In a way, it's validating to think that all of my struggles with attention and memory and listening could be explained by an ADHD diagnosis; I'm not just lazy and undisciplined or unfocused.   I'd very much like to approach this subject with my therapist, and possibly see what solutions are available for me. I'm just not sure how to go about it without being dismissed for not having the physical hyperactivity that's usually associated with this disorder. Any thoughts/advice would be much appreciated!  tl;dr: after two years thinking I had depression and anxiety, ADHD seems to be the answer to all of my problems, also not sure how to approach the subject with my therapist
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;DR appointment tomorrow ; have a list of symptoms written down. Affecting my college, work and social life. How have you been treated for Adult ADHD and how much has it helped?;;;I am 25 years old and finally decided it's time to talk to a doctor about some symptoms that have been plaguing me since around freshman year of highschool.   It was almost like a sudden transition. I started to wake up feeling completely restless. I had 0 energy and it was a serious struggle for me to get around to my normal routine.   I am not exactly sure when I started to daydream as much as I do, but I have an extremely bad case of dazing off mid-conversation, lecture or whatever. One word can set me off into a daze and it's so embarrassing at times when I am out and about socializing. Meeting new people is hard too. They tell me their name, a few seconds later im off in my head thinking about lord knows what, and now I forgot this new persons name.. Or a close friend talking to me about whatever and then try to engage me into the conversation I am like a deer in headlights sometimes.  I would say the worst way this is affecting me is the fact I took a break after 2 semesters of college because it was just too hard for me to concentrate in a classroom setting when 90% of it is lectures. Even when I make a real conscious effort to pay attention, I catch myself daydreaming again. Sometimes only for a few moments, sometimes for several minutes and so on which really hurts me in the fact that I am missing out on key notes or important details regarding projects and what have you.  I originally scheduled a doctors appointment for what I suspect to be a anxious tick as I suffer from mild to severe anxiety. My arms, shoulders and legs spasm out randomly. It feels very intense, but when its happening, it's barely physically noticeable to any of my friends when it occurs. Some times my entire body jerks/spasms when I am in bed trying to rest. I have been stressing that it could be some serious neurological problem, but I digress.   I never thought about it possibly being Adult ADHD. I didn't even realize there was such a thing until recently emailing my old school counselor who also happens to be a psychiatrist. I always associated ADHD in children with bouncing off the walls, non stop energy accompanied by the inability to pay attention. Since I can't afford to see a psychiatrist about this problem, I figured I would bring it up to my doctor tomorrow. This will be the 3rd time I have seen him (from 18 to almost 25 I never had a regular Doctor).    For all of you out there that have been diagnosed with Adult ADHD, what kind of treatment did you get and has it drastically improved your symptoms? Do my symptoms come off as possibly ADHDish?  Sorry for such a long post, I just wanted to make sure get into as much detail as possible about my current issues.        EDIT : I was diagnosed with RLS (restless leg syndrome) last year and so far the meds I have tried have not helped
586b0a62854b54e96f3bbf82aa9b991106dbd631c3c5fc433001027309d874bc;;;I was writing down strategies to help with my ADD and looking back on them a few minutes later, I realized I stopped one part of the way through;;;It made me chuckle. I've off and on thought I've had ADD. I remember that while having focusing problems a lot in life, my symptoms didn't seem to exactly match the DSM or whatever guides for ADD.  But I think by this point, it doesn't matter. My focusing problems could be the result of my depression or (what I suspect) some (unknown to most doctors) physical problem that exhausts me and ADD is more of a symptom of that than its own diagnosis.  I basically didn't have focusing problems until the age of 13 which doesn't make sense.  But yeah ever since then, I obsessively have to put *every* appointment in my phone and have multiple reminders go off, I'm always setting alarms. If I don't, I just don't remember. I have like 60 reminders continually cycling through my phone.  I'm a writer/musician, and every time I get an idea, I have to write it down or put it in my voice memos within 5 minutes or there's an 80% chance I'll completely forget it. It doesn't matter where I am. If I'm in the middle of a run, I have to do it then and there or I won't remember. At work I'd write down ideas on receipt paper. So over the years I've accumulated literally at least a couple thousand of those. Likely a lot more.   I loved high school because of the external structure and being able to basically survey a ton of amazing subjects. Well it was hard for me then, but... College on the other hand was hell for me, I failed out, took some time off, and then finished with just mediocre performance. Now I'm trying to follow my passions of music-making and writing, which is fucking hard because I'm doing it all by myself.  I'm really good at spinning pencils in multiple ways  Yep cool thx 4 the read

dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Me (35 f possible adhd) and my son (7 m recently diagnosed and on medications) need advice, very badly.;;;Just found this sub. I really need someone who understands to tell me anything that may help here.   Me, diagnosed with 'hyperactivity' at a time when adhd was fairly unknown. Around the age of 8, never medicated, I guess I sort of 'grew out of it'  but from my own perspective I simply learned to cope.  In my adult life I have not sought treatment.   Some things I remember from my behavior. I could concentrate on certain things easily, to the exclusion of everything else if it was something that interested me ( books). Trying to complete any task was either total immersion or painfully difficult to stay on track.   I am not sure how much of my other behaviors were adhd or personal quirks, so for the sake of brevity i am leaving out a lot. I have always been pretty solitary, lone wolf, independent, not shy, but described as 'sensitive'. This being sensitive I largely grew out of unless there is extreme confrontation.  Sensitive and easily emotionally overwhelmed. Now I am laid back, easy going, and it takes a lot to get under my skin.   My son. I was pretty much in denial about his adhd, until last December. When you have a 6 year old failing first grade it is a kick into reality . He has no other problems that I or doctors or teachers are seeing.  He is helpful, cooperative, polite, happy, gets along well with everyone, curious, and.outgoing. He also cannot concentrate, unless it is of his own choosing. When i let him watch tv or play a game he often does not hear me at all until i am yelling right beside him. I remember i was the same way.   We started medication ( adderal) in january. As we slowly increased dose he lost weight, so was switched to focalin. He is eating normally again, and dosage is finally where it should be it seems. Sometimes he is like a whole different kid, much calmer and able to follow direction, less likely to bounce off the walls when we do something simple like a shopping trip. Only a few weeks ago we finally completed a shopping trip ( two hours) with him not running, me not chasing, not having to keep refocusing him, him not grabbing at everything and begging for toys and candy everytime we walked past a display. I nearly cried when we got home from sheer relief.  He just walked with me through the whole store, getting items i asked him for, talking to me and being more *there* than i had ever seen before.   The past few weeks. I am having trouble now seeing the difference between him acting out because of his age, and because of adhd. I knew before there was some things he could not help, so tried to be relaxed a bit about things like having to get his attention and clean up and generally behave himself. Not that there were no rules, i just gave him a bit extra time or sat with him and talked him through tasks. ( he still had to do all the work himself like folding clothes, sweeping, and one or two other chore that are his).   Now he can follow through without help, but mostly delays a lot. Or does things he knows he is not allowed to do that he did not do much of before. Feet on the coffee table, not using a coaster, not putting his plate in the sink after eating. I know these are little things, he is a good kid. But before medication i would only need to remind him to do these things a few times a week or once a day at most. Now it is every hour at least and every five minutes at worst. Three times in ten minutes tonight i had to tell him to remove his feet from the table. This has been building for three weeks since they upped his dosage last.   How do I tell what is behavior due to adhd, which i feel he cannot help and do not want to punish unjustly, and when it is time to crackdown and punish as willful? Could medication be causing this 'forgetfulness'?   Another thing is 'being sensitive'. He cries alot now.  It only started in the last month too. I interrupt his play time to ask him to do a quick task. Today, i called him away from a game to bring me something as i was cleaning. He nearly had a meltdown when he 'couldnt find it' after half a second of looking. Two steps toward where the object was, and tears, that fast.   He says a lot of 'but i cant do that' with tears and crying in a lot of situations lately.    He is not spoiled at all. This is very unlike him. Todays example would have normally taken him all of sixty seconds before he was back at his game. It took much longer than that to calm him down today. I cannot figure out what happened.   Nothing else is different except school starting, but that was last week and this new behavior is a few weeks older. This started at the same time as the better and calmer behavior,  and the higher dose of.  focalin.   I could use any advice. Any questions i will answer. Any ideas or thoughts? I am still new to dealing with this, but am determined to help him as much as i can now so he can have a good and peacefull future.

dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;How I experience ADD, struggles and some solutions;;;A brief description of ADHD for non-ADHD people as well as some coping strategies.  Have you ever tried meditating? In short, the most basic method consists of clearing your mind and focusing on your breathing. When thoughts (undoubtedly) arise, put them aside without evaluating as them as bad/good/whatever that would provoke a "feeling" reaction and return your sole focus again to your breath.  ADHD is like having a really hard time even keeping a regular meditation regimen because you really don't feel like sitting down and starting the practice at the set time (usually you have to be motivated at just the right time to be able to start something without someone "forcing" you or the task at hand being part of a learned routine) and/if you at last get started with your sitting meditation/bod scan/whatever method you prefer, just like non-ADHD people your mind tend to wander but to a much greater degree - I have been diagnosed with ADD so for me it mainly an internal process but it might as well be not being able to sit still/be quiet/other physical impulsive behavior.  Continuing using the meditation metaphor, my experience is that once motivation to do a task has been built up, hyper-focus tends to present itself as a strong will to single-task and focus on the very task at hand that has created the motivation. Leaving the task unfinished or having to switch to another job at hand often feel very unsatisfactory and makes it hard to make long-term plans such as weekly/monthly schedules because of the problems switching focus. I think this can be compared to the feeling of "flow" or when you get totally engulfed in a video- och sports game or when you just don't want to stop reading a really good book.  As a consequence (I think it is not directly caused by the ADD at least), I have a hard time "just-doing" things if I don't have a clear plan of how to do it (eg. A-B-C-goal). Easily losing focus also makes it harder to make approximations of how long things planned are actually going to actually take to get done, which in itself makes "time" a bit of a slippery concept.   Anyways, what works for me and what I still need working on:  I got this book recommended and I find it is a good starting point as well as an easy read, http://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Your-Adult-ADHD-Cognitive-Behavioral-ebook/dp/B00JPHHVZQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1408520596&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=safren+adhd  1. File your stuff, I use this system: http://lifehacker.com/156196/geek-to-live--organizing-my-documents Limit the categories of your "docs" folder, I use "Health", "Wealth", "Relationships" and "General Happiness", if you have a special interest that takes up a lot of your time make a separate category for that too.  2. Create a to-do list using the same categories, try to make each item actionable (doable in a day at most, otherwise consider making it a sub-project of one of the categories".  3. Everything that has a set date or time goes into your calendar. I am all digital so I use google.  3. Have a "dump"-file at hand. If you find yourself dreaming of becoming a gardener when studying for your maths-test, make a note in the dump file. Really, anything that is not on your to-do list for today should go here. At the end of the day, purge the dump-list and either delete non-important things or move them to the to.-do-list.  4. Limit your hobbies and interests. If you want to make any progress you have to make choices and sacrifices, time and attention are limited and having more things that may cause your mind to wander will work against achieving your goals.  5. Find an environment with as few distractions available as possible. I find it really hard to work from home, the internet is an easily available gigantic time-waster. At work or the public library you are way less prone to listen to loud music/read forums/look at porn/whatever =)  6. Sleep; Still a problem, I have a hard time winding down at night, rather I seek out stimulating activities such as music/movies/reading etc. Having had a good and productive day helps though, sleeping pills really does not. As for waking up in the morning (even harder) I have been experimenting with setting a soundless wake-up light alarm half an hour before my real alarm goes off. I have only been at this for a few days but so far I have had good results.  7. Medication. Game-changer, totally. I have been diagnosed for less than a year so I am still learning to handle the change though. You don't get an auto-pilot but once started, things gets done much easier.  Irritating stuff: While daydreaming comes easy, and goal-setting as well to a degree, Self-motivating while working to a goal still is really hard, thinking like "I have to do this to achieve these goals and then it will feel really good" I find not really motivating much of the time. Might be a sign of depression though?

Thank you r/ADHD;;;After discovering this subreddit and gaining the courage to talk to a doctor, I've finally been diagnosed with ADHD-PI. I'm being put on ritalin and will be visiting my psych in 3 weeks time to get the script for it (Australia is very strict when it comes to ADHD medications, you need approval which takes 3 weeks). Thank you all! For the first time in my life, I feel like theres hope for me to excel in life since leaving high school.  TL'DR: got diagnosed and cant wait to turn my life around.
96f32867609d8ba90b59192997bfa53735af2fb54160047240e2d73b0a0e8b66;;;ADHD and accepting mediocrity;;;Hello /r/ADHD, my name is bamathrasher and I'm a chronic half-asser.  All of my life as far as I can remember I've struggled with half assing everything. School work, video games, relationships, literally everything. I was first diagnosed and started taking vyvanse for treatment my junior year of college. I can only describe vyvanse as it created this "curiosity" in me to challenge myself to learn and do new things. It helped me tremendously to get through the last couple difficult years of school and start a career as a sysadmin. I was quite successful in that field because the higher ups loved me. I was the perfect "band-aid" guy as I loved new challenges but unlike a "normal" person who would want to learn about what caused the problem to prevent it from happening again, my specialty was cutting out all that fluff and just fixing the problem as quickly as possible. This resulted in them coming to me with any quirky, weird thing they knew I'd love and anybody else would scoff at.   The problem with that is, I apply the same "logic" to everything in my life and I don't know why. I am always seeking new challenges but become quickly frustrated and seek the quick fix even if I have to cut corners. Last year I left my sysadmin job to move home and run the family business, 4 restaurants with over 50 employees, and being the boss now I feel like I shouldn't be half assing anything ever, and should actually be pushing others not to either. I'm curious if this is a side effect of ADHD or just a personality flaw. If anyone else feels the same and has changed it, how did you do so? I fight the urge to seek the quick fix as best I can but it really is just that..a fight.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Adderall and other stimulant users tell me about your experiences with ADHD medication?;;;I'm curious as to dosage and frequency other adderall users utilize to treat their ADHD.  I've been on 20 mg Adderall IR twice a day since I was diagnosed about 4 years ago. Rarely have I ever taken 40 mg in one day, except for a few extreme cases back when I was in college. I would average about 30mg 3 to 5 days a week, taking one pill in the morning and another half several hours later.  Now that I'm out of school I continue to take the drug although I have cut back significantly. One bottle typically lasts 3 to 4 months. I usually take 20mg one day a week for work, and 30mg on Saturday and Sunday for personal projects and study.  When my GP retired last winter I had to jump through a ton of hoops with my new GP to continue to receive my medication including drug tests and attempts to reduce my prescription or switch to XR. In an attempt to keep up appearances I refill the script each month and I'm presently sitting on about an 8 month supply.  Like many adderall users my primary concern lies in building tolerance. This tends to discourage me from taking the drug as frequently as I should need it or consuming my full dosage. There are days where my ADHD can be particularly debilitating which has lead me to consider trying another medication, however I fear that by switching to something else whether it be XR or something like Vyvanse I may not be able to return to the IR which has served me well over the past few years.
1ad6b8efa26fae251a4b21ece1712f409131d79862b2a52bc3141b9f27a3ccff;;;I need tips and advice on helping my son [16], who is newly diagnosed, do well in school.;;;My teenage son [16] was diagnosed with ADHD a few months ago. He also has Aspergers. It has been a big change for us to adjust to the diagnosis (though my husband and I have suspected for awhile), but we've been busy plowing through a lot of reading material to ensure that he has the support and help he needs. We are also in the process of getting him on medication.  He will be going to a new school this year, and I'd love some advice on how to best help him adjust.   As a family, we discussed what might help him, and though he says it'll be annoying, he thinks an after-school schedule would be beneficial. I agree, after doing so much reading that says schedules and routine are helpful. I have a few questions on how to approach a schedule though.  1.) When he sits down to do homework at a specific time, how much involvement should I have in making sure everything gets done? I don't want to hover or nag, but I know he gets distracted easily.   2.) Should his homework/study time be broken up (i.e. study, then break, then study, etc.) or should there just be a block of time to do it?  3.) Is there anything else I can suggest to him that might help him study/do homework? I've heard listening to gentle music can help.   Thank you so much! Any other advice would be greatly appreciated, as this is still very new to us all.
77fabe99850e426ac5c5b412f9ccc252727644169c31d5d8e68ce22be5ec3feb;;;If you found your miracle drug, would you take it?;;;It sounds like this question has such an obvious answer, but...hear me out.  Adderall is my "miracle drug".   It hits me fast. The sky is blue, the sun is warm, the birds are chirping. I feel perfect.   My social anxiety is nowhere to be found. I am finally able to be myself without feeling ashamed.  Studying is not only effortless, but *fun*, because I love learning deep down but hate the struggle.   I have no anxiety over possible failure; I feel capable. I feel peace. I can relax.   I feel the connectedness and empathy for humankind that has been missing all my life. I love the person I see in the mirror.   My to-do list is scribbled off and tossed out of the way before dinnertime. I have no side effects; I eat, I sleep, I don't crash. I am myself, potential unlocked.  **But**...I've been keeping myself on Ritalin since getting pseudo-diagnosed this past spring. It clears away the weeds in my mind to let me do what I need to do, but it's still up to me to do it. I don't have the drive. I don't eat. IR gives me chaotic ups and downs; XR keeps me up all night. Half the time, the only indicator I've taken it is a pounding heart and a restless body.  I tell my doctor "well, it's better than nothing", and walk out with a prescription for 90 more 10mgs once a month. I've been complacent with this.  Why?   **I fear addiction**. It's as if my brain was a specially made lock for which Adderall is the only key. As if I were wired to just *fucking love it*. I keep my supply an armslength away at all times and have to keep complete self-control. I trust myself with anything else (ex: the 30-day supply of Oxycodone and the 2 weeks' worth of Xanax still sitting in my medicine cabinet, untouched in months), but Adderall is...too good.  Just a little too much Ritalin gives me heart palpitations, an antsy stomach, and cold sweats. I've learned my lesson there. Having 90 at my disposal to disperse throughout the month isn't dangerous.  Even moreso, I **fear losing my panic switch**. Just knowing that there's a drug out there that can make me exactly who I want to be is the most comforting thought in the world. I feel incredibly lucky that such a drug exists. I know that if life suddenly becomes overwhelming, and I managed to put off that paper for three weeks, I can bang it out in a few hours and do an amazing job while having a great time. I know that if I fall behind, I can catch up. This fact relieves more anxiety than you can imagine.  I don't care about the "high". I care about the impact that my very occasional use has on my life.  If I take it daily or near-daily, and those effects are eventually diminished or lost, what do I have left to get me through those god-awful days where I just can't get my shit together? Even using it every other day, I feel the drop-off. What do I have to fall back on when my own determination and brute strength isn't enough? I love knowing that one 30mg pill can be divided up into three "panic switches" to have on hand, just in case.  I know Adderall is perfect, and that's why I stay away from it. But, does that even make any sense?
2dc147ed5e33061fdc6edd79368cc827db99d5eab4576367e34861db49271b68;;;Finally saw a psychiatrist today. Wanted to say thanks.;;;Almost two years ago, I was browsing /r/bestof, and someone had linked a post from this subreddit. Something along the lines of "What it's like to live with ADHD." I read through it and thought, "Wait a second. It isn't normal to feel this way?"  I started browsing /r/adhd a lot, and the deeper I dug, the more I realized there was probably something wrong with me. I was teaching in Korea at the time, so I didn't really have much access to psychiatric help, but I started a running list of symptoms I noticed. It turned into a full two pages of ramblings of my day-to-day struggles. I moved back to the states about 5 months ago, and I just started a job with full benefits, which opened the door for me to finally get checked out.  This morning I spoke with the psychiatrist for the first time, and he's pretty convinced I have ADHD-PI. He instructed me to taper off the massive amounts of coffee I drink, and come back to see him in 30 days, at which point we will discuss medication. Speaking of medication, he's letting me choose my own after listening to his description/opinion of each. Is that normal?  Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you to everyone here who has shared stories, information, encouragement, and all around good vibes.

A question (which I will also ask my doctor when I see him next in 15 days).  He started me off on the smallest dose of Vyvanse 20 mg.  I am also on wellbutrin xr 300 mg.  If I take it I do not feel it kick in until about **9 hours** later.  Even then I do not feel it but I am more productive during this time which I can notice if I am reflective enough to think about it, but I am not more productive during the first few hours.  1)  Is my body due to luck just taking for ever to split the lysine off the Vyvanse amphetamine salts?  2)  Or the dose is too small and I am just feeling the effects for the drug is at my peak?  I know you can't get me a definite answer I am just asking for personal opinions and experiences with vyvanse.

The problem is that the people I would like to be friends with like me a lot at first, then they slowly stop returning my texts, and then eventually we don't talk. I know I'm fucking up in there somewhere. Obviously. What am I doing, how can I fix this, I'm 20 and my life is slipping away.

I think I have been depressed for the past 10 years.  I'm on wellbutrin right now and needless to say, it has been the best medicine I have ever tried.  It's kicking my depression to the curb.  This is just amazing...I've tried almost every SSRI/SNRI and they just made me crash and burn.    Looking back, I don't think I've felt this happy since I was younger than 12 years old.  Seriously.  It makes me cry just thinking about how far I've come.  My personality is back.  It's so amazing.  The only downside is that with my depression subsiding, my hyperactivity is really showing.  I'm at the point where I have to watch what I say, because I'm back to my old self.  I just love feeling this way.  I'm different, but you know?  Who cares.  I'm just happy and I'm myself again.   I can't ever remember feeling this "way" in so long.  I mean, shit.  10 freaking years have flown by and I'm just now rediscovering my crazy self.    There were many times after my diagnosis that I thought to myself "Is this really me?  Do I really have ADHD-C?  I'm not that hyper, this doesn't make sense".  But yeah, it's incredibly apparent to me that this is who I am and I have to make the best of it.   If anyone is struggling to feel a sense of peace with their head, please know that it will get better.  I mean that.  I have been down the road of depression and anxiety and I know how it feels.  Just try to keep your head up and understand that many of us are going through the same thing and know how you feel.   Thanks for reading.  I'm sorry I don't have much to offer with this post, I'm just wanting to get my thoughts out there.    **TLDR: Depression is going away, Hyperactivity is like OH HI IM BACK, REMEMBER ME OLD FRIEND? :D**
5eb92f562057142d87baae7b89c914a5cea98648657e4222ed82ab6b3e98932c;;;How to get diagnosed (without spending $2K) ?;;;Hello  I'm really confused and I could use your guys' help. I'm working my first job out of college and my lack of attention to detail is nearly going to get me canned. Because of my behavior at work, I'm pretty sure my boss thinks I'm either lazy, stupid, or I don't care. Besides that, my "odd" tendencies are driving me insane, or at least making me insanely stressed out.   I live in a new city so before my first write-up at work, I got a referral from my college counselor to see a therapist and get tested for ADHD (as I see it). She saw me twice, the second time she gave me a general mental exam and then she gave me the DSM questions. She wrote up her results, consulted with her supervisor and decided i'm clinically symptomatic of ADHD-PI, but the cause is unknown (actually ADHD, or something else). She then referred me to this neurological clinic, which charges roughly $2000 for a diagnosis. I made an appointment, they sent me a big ass packet that scared me so I canceled my appointment, or rather, rescheduled indefinitely.   I've since been trying to figure out how much my insurance will cover, and from what I've gathered talking to my insurance people and the clinic, I have to meet my deductible (deductible is $1500) for this treatment. So essentially I would be paying a little over $1500.   I don't doubt that they would do a good job, but I was having intense reservations, so I started looking online and I found some doctors saying that you should avoid expensive neurological testing because they're not necessary. I feel like this is true. Before I called my college counselor I was just going to find a psychiatrist that deals with ADHD and make an appointment.   My girlfriend told me to talk to my primary physician, which I don't have in this city, because her sister was having issues, which ended up being bipolar and her doctor gave her some medication until she could track down a therapist and get diagnosed. This would involved yet more complications, but it's a good idea.   I'm really confused, and this is getting way to complicated for my stress level, and my possible adhd brain. Honestly, I need medication ASAP. Lately I've been fearful that I will one day become homeless because of this.  Thank you so much in advance, I'll appreciate any perspectives.   Also, should I tell my boss? My GF said that it would be discrimination for them to fire me if I told them I was seeking treatment for something, but I think I would need to be diagnosed. I'm not sure what to do on this front either.

Myself is no exception.    That said, I have 4-5 close friends, unfortunately they live far away. In 12 years at a new place my only friendship is through the misses and acquaintances here and there, at work etc... But these 4-5 close friends, two of them have been diagnose with AHDH, and the others are in the progress and strongly suspect they have ADHD, all of us PI btw.  My theory is that people with ADHD more often than not will find their best friends with other ADHDs. Its kind of logical, the things "normal" people find weird and annoying about us, other with ADHD see as normal and familiar.
982ebde7013804228026e779ff85fba8a7438d412bbabd13aefabc4acde1fd4d;;;Mini "Life Pro Tip" regarding social skills. Possibly.;;;Ever read the book "how to win friends and influence people" ? The biggest tip in that book arguably is "be *genuinely* interested in others - it even goes so far as to say that feigning interest will do the *opposite* of "winning friends".  For me, this is an issue. I'm not sure if this is ADHD-related or not, but I really don't care about other peoples lives. I don't care to talk about mine, or hear about theirs. I have a hard time being genuinely interested in people, regardless of how much I like them.    I'm not an asshole, I swear. I'm very caring and love my friends to death, but I just...get bored.     Today, I have a meeting with someone who I definitely want to build good rapport with, so I was wondering how can I just for once be *interested* in someone. Truly.   So I invented a little game.    My goal today: Find out where he grew up.    How will I get this info?   *Creepyness*: Oh, you've been tattooing for 18 years? Was it always here? Where did you work before? Oh, did you grow up there?    I have a goal: find out where he grew up.    Maybe I shouldn't need these "games" to be interested in people, but maybe this will help. CBT has helped me a lot with other issues, and I feel this could work.   I really genuinely do want to know this now...for selfish reasons yes ("Win" my game) but...we'll see.    This is dumb.  [Maybe I'm just an asshole.](http://marcjohnsonbooks.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/8516admitting-you-re-an-asshole-pos.jpg)   Will report back.     **TLDR: Can I overcome my disinterest/boredom with every human being by setting a goal to find out a specific fact about them?**   Other tips would be appreciated!     *edit: didn't end up having the meeting. will try this next time it's relevant. i think it could work.*

Everything makes so much more sense now, and it's such a relief to have the diagnosis alone. I'm starting meds tomorrow and hope the results will be good. :-D
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;As a (sort-of) outsider looking in...;;;The more I think about ADHD, the more I am concerned with the over diagnosis with it. Is it possible or even likely that for some of people, it's largely mental? (Obviously ADHD is a mental, but I mean more state of mind, rather than poor wiring) In the day and age that we live in, distractions are a part of life. I was diagnosed with it recently because I am easily distracted, so I was prescribed Vyvanse and it's working really well. But I'm not completely sure I "need" it. I always get stuff done, I just do parts of the task in bursts of 20 minutes or less. Is this way of working really detrimental to productivity?   I think I just need to try harder at staying on task, and the focus will come soon; I also think that a lot of people should try that before getting a prescription. Also please don't have a kneejerk reaction, I'm not saying that everybody is faking it or whatever extremist ideas people often have.  Thanks in advance!

I did take it previously a couple times in college (literally two times) I was diagnosed last week and decided to take my adderall yesterday morning. Initially I felt very drowsy and and at unease. I felt tired but then half an hour I was able to focus for a little while and then it would go away. Overall in the day I thought it helped. When I got home my nose was a little runny. I thought it wasn't a big deal. At night it got worse and I couldn't sleep - which was okay with me because I know that's an initial side effect. But then I woke up and I felt sick and it felt like I had a really bad cold. My nose was soooo runny and clogged it wasn't even funny. I took an Allegra and was able to get 4 hours of bad sleep. Is a runny nose and congestion a common side effect or is this going to wear off over time because last light was the worst night I've had in a while. Please let me know what you guys think. I'm going to go to my psych pretty soon and tell him what happened. Also one of eyes looked noticeably smaller than the other which I thought was weird.
e0a89658da4f1efb3de17af6484cf4cea814631827070abfa439522f7e9e1c42;;;My boyfriend has ADHD. I don't know what to do anymore. Can anyone help me?;;;I met my current boyfriend about 3 years ago. We started dating a few months after that, and a year later we were living together. He was diagnosed with ADHD (I'm sorry, but I'm not sure of the specific type) when he was 10. During childhood/teenage years, his treatment included medication as well as well as some therapy, diet/nutrition supplements, and anger management classes. Flash forward to now, his "treatment" includes medication about 90% of the time (By that, I mean that he takes his Adderall XR 25mg most days, but will skip some days if he's got nothing important going on.) and he smokes marijuana daily to self-medicate.   I have known about his ADHD since very early on in our relationship, but my understanding of ADHD then was minimal. All I really knew was exactly what the name tells you, a person with ADHD will have problems with paying attention and hyperactivity. After my boyfriend and I started living together, I learned about the myriad other problems associated with ADHD-- the anger, the depression, the anxiety, and the issues with perception and self awareness (which is a HUGE problem in our relationship).  I love him very much. I HATE his ADHD. About a year ago, I picked up "Delivered from Distraction" in order to learn more about the disease that is overtaking my relationship. It made so many things clear for me, and helped me understand what a terrible, terrible struggle ADHD can be for a person. But, it also gave me hope. There are a lot of (seemingly simple) things you can do to help your ADHD symptoms. Daily exercise, good diet, and taking a multivitamin. Most people would rejoice if they found out their health issues could be so easily helped. Not the person with ADHD though and especially not my boyfriend. Forming a new habit is so incredibly hard for him, and it's difficult for me to keep reminding him to take his multivitamin, and did you exercise at all today, and hey, you probably should eat something a little healthier, right? I don't like feeling like I am nagging him all the time. I don't want to be that girlfriend.  One of the symptoms of ADHD that "Delivered from Distraction" alerted me to was issues with perception. Very often my boyfriend will be upset with me, saying I said something or did something, and these "somethings" are things that he has entirely misinterpreted or his memory created something that never actually happened. And, I can never reason with him. If I say, "no, what I actually said was..." He never believes me. And I really mean never. He gets into these "angry states" (I don't have a scientific word for it) and he can't be reasoned with. Since he has no filter and he gets so angry, he has managed to say some incredibly hurtful things to me. What's really bad about is that the smallest thing can trigger these angry episodes. (One time when we were visiting a friend, I accidentally stepped in a puddle. His exact words were "I should just fucking leave you here and go home.") After he comes down from the angry cloud, he always apologizes but after a while "I'm sorry" doesn't mean anything anymore. Especially since he considers the apology to be the complete fix, and I'm not allowed to be upset about it after he's apologized. He said he was sorry and if I'm still mad then I'm the bitch.  There have been a few times that we've managed to have mildly successful conversations about ADHD and our relationship. By "successful" I mean that the conversation doesn't end with him being pissed or telling me to "just stop talking." Usually any "change" only lasts a day or two. He tells me that his ADHD is "not my problem." I understand that he must feel like a burden and he doesn't want me to worry about it, but it is affecting me every single day. How is it "not my problem" too?  I'm sorry about the rant. I realize that I haven't given all that much information, but I am so lost. I love my boyfriend and I would do anything I can to help him, but I am out of ideas. How do I help? Can I help? Any stories/information/ideas are welcome.   Edit: proofreading

I have the HIGHEST dose of amphetamines I have ever seen...so tired. Advice?;;;Hey Reddit! I have been taking medication for ADHD for the past 8 years but I have found that *compared to those I have reached out to in person and you great people on the internet;* I am taking a dose that I am suspecting is NOT normal. For the last couple of months I have not been able to go to my physician as I lost my insurance. Not taking the medication has caused me to sleep like 18 hours a day but I am at a point now (6 MONTHS) later where I can sleep for 9 hours and feel 'just' tired. I remedy that by drinking a pot of coffee in the morning just to be functional. I just need to know if anyone else went through this withdrawl, this is just such a HUGEEE withdrawal.  My medication regimen for ADHD is as follows: ****  ADHD (Combined Type) ------------------------------- - Vyvanse 30ct [70mg] - 1/day  - Vyvanse 30ct [50mg] - 1/day - Adderall XR (Generic-BARR) - 60ct [30mg] - 2/day  - Adderall IR (Generic-BARR) - 60ct [10mg] - 2/day - Dextroamphetamine IR (Generic) - 60ct [10mg] - 2/day  **Note:** I am also taking medication for 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder' &amp; 'Panic Disorder' but I'm speculating that the aforementioned conditions are exacerbated by the ridiculous  amount of stimulant medication I am prescribed. These doses by themselves are not in/of themselves anything that deviates from what most would consider the norm regarding benzodiazepines.    Before my insurance ran out I took in addition to these meds: **** Major Depressive Disorder ---------------------------- - Lexapro - 30ct [20mg] - 1/day  ****  Residual High BP &amp; mild tachycardia [From ADHD Stimulant medications]  -------------------------------- - Propranolol LA (Brand)- 30ct [60mg] 1/day OR - Tenormin (Brand) - 60ct [20mg] 2/day  ****  Generalized Anxiety Disorder &amp; Panic Disorder *[See Footnote] --------------------------------- - Klonopin (Generic-Clonazepam) - 90ct [0.5mg] 3/day - Ativan (Generic-Lorazepam) - 60 ct [0.5mg] AS needed for PD - Xanax (Generic-Alprazolam) - 10 ct ONLY - **AS NEEDED for immediate panic attack.   Note: **Panic attacks are very far and few inbetween but since I have not been on the mediation I feel more physical side effects of anxiety as if my system is going through some kind of shock. I know self diagnosing is a dangerous game to play but I would go as far as honestly saying that I am developing strong agoraphobic tendencies. I have been trying to leave my condominium for some time for job interviews and the like but have not been able to get out of my head. I'm nodding off but I hope some kind soul lets me know I'll be ok. The lack of medications is killing me, I've tried a change in diet, exercise and such..Thanks in anticipation of some love.   TL;DR - No insurance anymore, system is going into literal shock from lack of medication. Panic, Depression, Major anxiety, Extreme apathy &amp; lethargy, REDIC amt of sleep. Wot do?  Edit 1: I posted in the wrong subreddit last time.  Edit 2: Clonazepam dosage was off.

I've been diagnosed with ADHD since I was in elementary school, but my mother thought that it was best not to put me on meds (as she doesn't believe that I have ADHD), and I've always struggled with my academics most of my life. My mind is pretty much all over that damn place and I find it almost impossible to even study, even if my gpa is on the line.  I tried convincing my mother that I should at least explore medication, and she agreed to at least go and get a prescription from my doctor. However, the moment we got my prescription, my mom basically hid my prescription and eventually flushed my meds after they expired. I ended up failing a class last semester and my ADHD has only gotten worst as of late.   At work, I'll easily have well over 50 tabs open on my work machine and at times I'll end up being easily distracted by the most minor things or ending up lost daydreaming at work. I'm not sure if this is within my legal rights now that I'm 18, but can I go behind my mother's back and get my own prescription without her consent?   tl;dr: I'm 18 and my mother doesn't believe I have ADHD. Can I get meds without her consent?

Hes given me 50mg to take every day for 2 weeks before upping the dosage, but from reading this forum and others apparently thats alot?  He said that he will eventually increase the dosage to 100-120mg and according to some people here thats a fuck load.  I realise that most of the posts talk about Vyvanse which is the same chemical but different brand name but I was wondering how the dosages differ between countries (for when im reading about other peoples experiences to compare).  If it helps the bottle says "Each Capsule contains 50mg Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, equivalent to 14.8mg of dexamfetamine".  Thanks for any replies.

I went through hours and hours of testing for learning disabilities and the psychologist determined that I was in fact very smart, but lacked sufficient focus. Therefore, even though I was doing well in school, I was not living up to my full potential (I started getting a 4.0 once I got treatment). I've had doctors tell me in the past that I couldn't possibly have ADHD because I always did well in school and was not disruptive. I feel like Kaiser would say this to me. Anyway, now that I've graduated I'm on my parents insurance with Kaiser. I've had troubles even getting an appointment with them. They tell me they'll call me back but then never do. I'm now running low on medication and I need it for working on my grad school applications. I have a few prescriptions from my old doctor still, but will Kaiser fill it for me? I've also heard that they make you take a drug test. Would they do this for a prescription I already have written? I smoke weed occasionally, but I hardly feel like that gives them the right to deny me my prescription. Also, would they be able to not write me a prescription in the future even though I have been formally diagnosed? Like can they take that diagnosis back?
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Getting diagnosed... I'm sure this is a new topic here. :);;; I'm having a hardtime getting diagnosed. I'm really trying, but am meeting roadblock after roadblock. My psychiatrist is rather conservative and doesn't want to consider or doesn't listen to me when I talk about ADHD. My psychologist keeps trying to get me an "neuropsychiatric assessment" and feels that I probably have ADHD; she also mentioned that my psychiatrist can be a bit conservative; she knows him. As it stands, if I continue with my current psychiatrist, I feel like it will be 3 or 4 months before I make any headway; that's if I do make any headway.  I've been calling around like mad to get an assessment done, but nobody is returning my calls (perhaps their really busy?)   How did you guys and gals get diagnosed - what hurdles did you have to overcome? What tests did you have to take? What doctor did you eventually end up using?   I'm half tempted to just go to different GPs in town and tell them I think I have it and to see if I can't get a script. I figure that if a drug is magical and eliminates or lessens the rumination, the procrastination, the forgetfulness, the scattered thought process, the song-playing in my head, the having to replay everything at night, and so on that I'd be better off and would know for sure. This isn't ideal and I'd like to do a more official way, but there just seems to be so many roadblocks to this.   Anyhow - I'd like to hear your stories.   Also - those taking medication and who exercise? How do you manage that? I love running and just can't give it up, but am concerned about heart rate and overall pushing my body too much.
e3a57887ebea967b6e6c12a92dca2a1eb003575f0db5cd8c3540e9ec86c1aec6;;;Scheduling an Appointment for ADHD at 19;;;I'm a sophomore in college, and I made great grades freshman year; however, that is because none of the classes I took required any reading. Just memorization or pure math. My whole life, up until this year, has been like this.  I have always known that focusing while reading was very hard for me, but as I said before, it never affected me much, and as a result, I never acted on this disadvantage.   Things this semester are different: each class I'm taking is so technical, the information cannot be taught in the class time given, and we have to do supplemental readings (or you will most likely fail to understand concepts ---&gt; fail class)  I'm scheduling an appointment with a primary care doctor soon (easiest for my insurance at first - if he needs to refer, that's okay, too). My only concern is that he will think that I'm faking the problem since I live in a college town and... that's what a lot of people do.  I am a really responsible dude, and put in the time and effort to achieve what I want, but due to this limitation it puts a hamper on other areas of my life due to having to read things 4-5 times and still not comprehending due to lack of attention.  Do you guys think I explained my situation well in this post, and do you think I'll have any problem getting some help? I really am frustrated with this, and I wish it didn't look like I may be lying due to not acting on it previously in my life.  Thank you for the help  **TL;DR**  * Always had problems with reading comprehension due to lack of attention direction * Never acted on it because it never really negatively affected me * Things are different with new technical classes * Will the doctor think I am lying, and how do I deal with this * Thanks
53c4c7d592397cb5ff3287c434a44968a82925018dc44da410a14a77306fb0f5;;;Diagnosis getting wonky [bit of a rant].;;;Hey there!  I've been lurking here and even posting a bit for a few weeks already, and I've mentioned that I was in the process of getting diagnosed for my (possible) ADHD. I guess it wasn't as easy as it sounded, even after my first visit to the neurologist, so excuse my little rant.  To **tl;dr** it a bit, they keep asking me to go (pay) for more tests, and the more I go, the more confused they seem to be as to what's wrong with me. My mother (who also has ADHD) and I are starting to think that some of the people in the clinic are not too knowledgeable about ADHD, but I feel kinda bad from making that judgement... and I also fear that I'm subconsciously trying to get the "easy" solution (medication) asumming that I got ADHD instead of what might be the right thing for me in reality (maybe therapy).  So, I've been wondering about having ADHD for a couple years already. I've always been a bad student, never, ever, as far as my memory can reach, I've been able to study for long spans of time. I've managed to get by thanks to a very supportive and pushy mother, and being able to learn all the crap I had to in the last day before finals. As it's common in these cases, I hit the college wall. At first I simply didn't care much. I guess I was still a bit inmature. But later, after living on my own for some years and growing up a bit, I started to worry about it.  My red flags started to raise when my inability to concentrate creeped into my hobbies. I've been unable to draw for over an hour since I started college, I though this was because I was getting bored of it due to my career (arts) turning pleasure into duty, but this started happening as well with playing videogames, and finally, with reading. If I do have ADHD, reading is my hyperfocus. I've read to exhaustion more times that I can remember. Me reading a book is picking it from beginning to end, and if it has 1200 pages, then I will read the shit out of it until my eyeballs melt. And having an e-book, this got to the alarming point in which I just can't stop reading until I finish a *series*. I've read Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, The Dresden Files and The Hollows one after another many times already. To put the icing on top, I love re-reading books, so sometimes as soon as I get to the end I just turn it over and start again.  So I though that it might be normal to be a useless lazy asshole who doesn't want to study (as shameful as it was to admit), but being such with *playing fucking games* was a tad too much, so I asked my mom for help and we got a date for the neurologist.  After seeing me, the doctor told me he thought that I was ADHD *and* intellectually gifted, which would explain my ability to save my studies in the last minute and the fact that I wasn't "caught" with either condition earlier, since they kinda cancel out in the most important part. He got me prepped for a test for ADHD in which in theory it would be seen if I had some "superior" aptitudes. Did that test (can get into details about them if anybody is interested) and waited for the results. I had finals in the meantime, and I found this place as well, so I wouldn't get those results until almost after a month. So I left for them and I've been reading here ever since.  Here, I've found people that are so much like me that is almost scary. I've noticed stuff that I've been doing all my life that I would have never thought about which might be caused by ADHD, in fact, I would say that I'm textbook ADHD, and meaning that I've even gotten an ADHD textbook from my mom and it's like reading my biography. My mother is also a pediatrician, so you can imagine that she's seen plenty of kids with ADHD and some carrying it out up until puberty. She's been researching this stuff for a while now, suspecting I had it as well, but not sure about it because of my reasonably good grades at the time. On top of that, she's also gifted and ADHD as well, only that she's *so gifted* that she was able to do the "late minute save" trick with the freaking medical career. And she's also a very good doctor, since that's her hyperfocus.   So, I was almost convinced I had ADHD. I even changed my flair because it seemed so clear... Then I got to the neurologist again.  Apparently, I *am* mentally gifted. The doctor told me that my concentration seemed pretty normal, some aptitudes above the norm, so he wasn't *too sure* at that point if I did have ADHD. He said that he still wanted to try medication and see how it helped me, since it's clear I got something anyways, but to make sure it wasn't some mental issue that might be worsened with the stimulants, he got me a date with the psychiatrist. The doctor who tested me for ADHD also wanted to give me an IQ test. So I got both dates for the next day, did the test and talked with the other guy about my life.  The doctor who did the tests, a neuropsychologist, seems pretty convinced that I *don't* have ADHD, but I didn't get into details with her. After talking with the psychiatrist, he seems unconvinced as well. To this one, I asked many questions in the end. I mentioned that I had been checking the development of many people with ADHD (you guys) that seemed to match me as if we were clones, but he said that the lack of concentration skills might be due to personality development issues (which is possible, of course, he's the doctor), and that the recent lack of motivation for hobbies come from changes in my life (breaking up with girl, moving back home).  The thing that got me a bit worried about his knowledge over ADHD came when I also mentioned how I was unable to study but able to save some of the info when under pressure, and due to my giftedness, that be enough to pass. He said that if I had ADHD, even if I was gifted, I would be entirely unable to memorize crap. He said that ADHD people usually learn late to read and talk, and that got me a bit annoyed, since he put it like ADHD people would always turn out to be almost analphabet ignorants, even if they were very smart. He says that my ability to study under pressure is not ADHD. I also told him that while I'm still capable of reading like there's no tomorrow, I seem to put it always for later, using the "I need to be sure I do have 16 hours free to read" excuse. He says that this isn't ADHD either, and that my problem is simply that I subconsciously refuse to put any effort on stuff that isn't interesting to me, and that I'm "growing out" of videogames.  He seemed excesively focused on his "life changes causing lack of interest" theory, and it gave me a bit of an impression that he didn't care too much about the fact that I had told him that half of those things had happened way before those changes. He also put lots of emphasis on things that I hadn't really cared much for, like the fact that I came back home after some years studying away from home. He issued another test, a personality test with the neuropsychologist again, for later in the month, and I'm currently waiting for that.  My mother calls bullshit on all he said. She said that she's seen plenty of kids with ADHD that disproves half of that he said, and that knowing I'm gifted, it matches me as well almost perfectly. She says that the psychiatrist and psychologist seem to be trying to shove me into their respective specialities without too much knowledge over ADHD, which is a neurologic aliment. Sometimes we think that they're trying to milk money out of us as well, but the neurologist himself does see me for free ever since my mom let go that she's a doctor as well. She's even said that knowing that I'm gifted and that I don't have any psychiatric issue to explain any irregularity, she'd be willing to prescribe the treatment to me herself, since she's a doctor as well and has done it to other kids before, but she wants to wait until the three dudes reach a conclusion, whatever that is. In the meantime, I'm into my 5th date, with at least three more in the future, and paying a crapton of money everytime I go.  I'm starting to lose hope, and all the freaking awesome feeling of knowing how everything made sense that I was carrying for the last weeks is fading. I'm afraid that I'm trying to rationalize myself into ADHD because I want the easy way out, getting the magic pill that will automatically buff my mind, instead of the long, painful and bothersome process of therapy that I might need. I'm afraid of blaming my doctors instead of myself... because I've always blamed myself, and when I've started not to, it seems that it comes back to me. I don't want it to be a personality flaw, because it means I *am* a useless lazy asshole, and even though I've read dozens and dozens of things that point out to me having ADHD, even though I've read tons of tales about doctors being wrong, my insecurities are coming back.  Sigh. Sorry for the extra long wall of text. It's funny how easily we make these but we can't bother reading them, isn't it? Kudos to anybody who gets here, lol.
090af5d5fb2385d240708d66f1df6082e420d51f9e5d54261f69a568803660fa;;;Sociability on meds vs. off;;;One thing that really bothers me about taking medication, is that i'm far less sociable/don't enjoy talking to people nearly as much. I've been on medication for roughly 3 years and no matter what stimulant drug i use, the results tend to be the same.   When i'm off my medication its like i turn into a comedian, i can make people laugh really easily without even thinking as well as laughing a lot more in general about situations/thoughts/peoples behaviors. Talking to people is a lot easier as i just impulsively say whatever is on my mind, i can think of witty responses in an instant. In class i become a stand up comedian, and the students as well as the teacher become my audience. Sometimes i'll say something funny impulsively without even thinking/realizing why people would find it funny in the first place. Overall i'd say my school day is a lot more enjoyable off my medication, i just feel a lot happier. Although when i get home and i'm alone i'd say i'm a lot less happy because the reality of my academic situation hits me, but overall i'd say the day is a lot more fun.    Now of course, while i'm off my meds my grades plummet, my sleep cycle goes to shit and not a whole lot gets accomplished. So i have to take my medication to get my grades back on track. On my medication its a lot harder for me to empathize with people, sometimes people in general just make me irritable. Its like instead of everything they do making me laugh, everything they do just pisses me off. I hardly laugh on medication, and people just seem foreign and the amount of things to talk about seems nil to slim. I do get my work done instead of lolly gagging  in class, so thats a plus.    So i guess the reason i made this post: has anyone experienced the same thing? how do you deal with it? How can i find a balance between social butterfly and robot?

Background/history-im 19, the oldest of 3, a 2nd year college student and was diagnosed with ADHD 9 months ago.     In my first semester of college; poor grades, two heart surgeries, parents got a divorce and my sister spiraled into depression.    Last January I suspected I had ADHD, I was diagnosed and have been routinely taking my medication and I am seeing a counselor.    I chose to transfer schools my spring semester, started medication and my GPA went from a 2.3 to a 3.5.  ____   I lost my 3 months worth of written perscrptions last week. I've searched everywhere.    ___        I called my doctors office and they told me there isn't anything they can do . They said it's my fault I lost them and that I have to wait until November to get new written perscriptions.      I'm honestly terrified.    Ive been without medication this semester (3 weeks) and already i can tell that everything is bad. I dropped a few classes so I'm only taking two..and even that is too much.      I'm hoping that I can get this figured out.  What are you experiences with losing written perscriptions?   Any advice for me..? I'm scared and stressed.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;How much longer?;;;So two weeks ago I was at my psychologist. I was there for having anxiety, but we ended up figuring out I had ADHD (plus comorbid anxiety). I didn't even believe it was a real thing at the time. I just thought I was lazy.   This week he gave me two tests one for a parent to fill out and one for me to fill out. He then scheduled me for an early appointment two days later (tomorrow) where I am going to take a timed test and possibly something to do with an EEG machine.    Now that I realize I have ADHD I recognize how much it effects my daily life, I dropped highschool and got my GED, I can barely work, I dropped out of a major university doing engineering, and am now going to community college, but I have a hard time completing more than even 3 classes.   My question is, after this timed test tomorrow, how much more time will it take and how many more tests are their before I will be able to try this medicine that seems to help so many.    Keep in mind even though I am taking the medicine route, I am going to still work with my psychologist and make life style changes that will help me be more successful. I just think the medicine will be a key tool in this, and the waiting is killing me.   He already told me that these tests were a formality, since it's stimulant medication he has to have documentation instead of just saying "Oh yeah, Wizzlman has ADHD, just take my word for it"   **TL;DR** I went to psychologist, he discovered I had undiagnosed ADHD. I've taken a lot of tests, how much longer before I can try the medication.

I've been on medication ever since grade school (I'm a junior in high school now) and from what I got from this sub and experience is that I need more time than most people with inserting numbers into formulas and everything beyond. Is it my math skills, adhd, or a helping of both?

I'm in High School (11th Grade). I made an appointment with a local psychologist to get screened. After a few sessions she diagnosed me with it. I'm a bit confused. I assumed that everyone had a tiny bit of ADHD and just dealt with it. She said I need to try something new in terms of studying as well as try some medicine (vyvanse is what she was getting at). What should I expect now in terms of effects as well as how this will change my life? I'm not worried really I just want to know whats up.

These people are quick to weary of everything; they want variety, and they are never able to feel or understand the needs of their fellow men who are not yet so callous. They are always the first to criticize a propaganda campaign, or rather its content, which seems to them too old-fashioned, too hackneyed, too out-of-date, etc. They are always after novelty, in search of a change, and this makes them mortal enemies of any effective political propaganda. For as soon as the organization and the content of propaganda begin to suit their tastes, it loses all cohesion and evaporates completely.  &gt;The purpose of propaganda is not to provide interesting distraction for blase young gentlemen, but to convince, and what I mean is to convince the masses. But the masses are slowmoving, and they always require a certain time before they are ready even to notice a thing, and only after the simplest ideas are repeated thousands of times will the masses finally remember them.  http://www.hitler.org/writings/Mein_Kampf/mkv1ch06.html  Couldn't find any mention of this on Google, but to me it seems like Hitler had identified a group of people with traits that we would now clearly associate with ADHD. What do you think?

Can anyone offer support/advice?;;;In therapy today, my therapist gave me an assessment and I met every single criteria for inattentive ADHD. I'm scheduling an appointment tomorrow to meet with a psychiatrist to discuss medications.  Have I been diagnosed?  I'm not sure how that works.    Reading through /r/ADHD took up most my day but I'm feeling a lot better about it.  I always thought I was just a lazy asshole but I'm glad my problems aren't just that.    I've had depression and anxiety since I was really young, and now this (I'm in my second-ish year of college).  My big problem right now is that I wrote in my planner that my first day of a late start class was tomorrow, the 19th, and I went to look at it tonight and it's been up since the 12th.  I'm probably going to get dropped.  I only have 3 classes right now because I failed all my classes last semester, so I'm kind of panicky.  I didn't have to try in high school and now everything is ten times harder..  tl;dr: how do you deal with feeling like a failure?

I am newly diagnosed and have been prescribed **Vyvanse** by my new *Psychiatrist*.   I have **not** started it yet.    I also *had* a follow up appointment with my **Family Doctor**.  He suggested I try **Ritalin** *before* I start the **Vyvanse**, so I could get an idea of how stimulants would most likely treat me.

dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Long shot, but looking for a doctor recommendation in Tampa, Florida.;;;My husband almost certainly has ADHD and it affects his job (high school teacher). He has adapted somewhat, but it is still a struggle for him to remain organized and focused. Over the summer he talked about wanting to pursue an actual diagnosis and treatment.  I was wondering if anyone has a doctor in the Tampa area that they recommend. I'm sure there are quite a few docs in the area who don't know jack about ADHD and would not take him seriously, or would think he's pill seeking, and we'd like to avoid a doctor like that. Just looking for someone with a known record of recognizing and treating adult ADHD so he can be confident he is getting an accurate evaluation.   Thanks!!

I.. honestly don't know how to deal with it or still accept it of having a form of autism, not that I feel retarded or anything, just pressurized and confused, since my parents treat me like I can't do stuff on my own, ever..  I just don't know how to deal with it, even though I wiki'd what it was about in full.. and everything is pretty accurate, I don't like social situations at all, let alone deal with huge crowds, I don't like to talk to people, I have to force myself to smile and conversate.. It frustrates me, because at some point I want to have a relationship, be more outgoing than introverted, I almost never socialize with family either, just keep to myself in my room and only go out for food, drinks and bathroom breaks..   So TL;DR - How do I get to accept myself, what I have and how do I turn all that is negative to positive energy?
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Review of Wellbutrin so far (4-5 days);;;Hi  i decided to stop taking stimulants because all of them give me bad anxiety   ive moved to wellbutrin which is an antidepressant sort of. basically it builds up in your system which it is doing right now  however i havent been depressed or sad in all of the days i have taken it which kind of makes it worth it for me, even if it won't help with my inattention. tbh i kind of feel it working already in terms of feeling motivated, but maybe thats just my specific body chemistry reacting to the drug or a placebo effect  so pretty much my depression and anxiety are gone and im starting to feel motivated  i dont want to recommend anything to anyone because everybodys different but so far wellbutrin is feeling pretty fn good.   this kind of sucks in a way because i was recommended to take this drug 5 years ago for my depression before i knew i had adhd. so its kind of shitty that im starting it now vs. then but right now i cant feel depressed about that even if i tried lol
3ac52d55f03344d885b258b37ee165b8d3fa198470592cfe16207ee5cc9d8c22;;;Went to a psychiatrist to get back on my meds and he says I might be bipolar II. After a lot of research I think my symptoms side with untreated ADD but the possibility is eating me up and I need support/life advice/your experiences. Thanks guys.;;;I was diagnosed with ADHD as a child, in 3rd grade. It helped enormously, I was able to do good in school and stay out of trouble. I have been off of my meds for several months because of insurance problems and money. While I was off of meds I worked a lot on myself. I had been on adderall  for over 6 years and I wasn’t sure I still needed it, could I survive without it now that I am an adult?? I found that I still struggle with paying attention and it effects my mood but I could control it and live with out medication if I had to.    Now that insurance is finally all sorted out I went to the psychiatrist this week. I was very honest, but I will admit I was a little more dramatic because I have had so many problems with doctors giving me problems and telling me I don’t need meds when I know that I do.     So he said that he would write my the script for Adderall but He wanted me to know that  **he thinks I might be Bipolar II.**  I thought he was just trying to re-diagnose me, but I promised I would go home, research it and keep an eye on my symptoms.    I know there is **nothing wrong** with having mental illnesses, but I am just so scared. Im worried that if this doesn’t work I have an obligation to myself and my husband to try going on bipolar medication. What scares me more than anything is  **what if I take bipolar medication and it WORKS.**  I want to be happy with MYSELF as ME.  When I finally brought it up to my husband last night and told him what happened he agreed with my plan.    My husband told me honestly he definitely thought it was possible that I could bipolar, but just a little bit. He was very sweet and agreed to keep an eye on me and help me observe.   I picked up my prescription for Adderall today and I have this feeling of dread. What if it doesn’t help my mood? What if I am bipolar?    I have been reading a lot of the posts and I think my moods fit better with the descriptions associated with ADD as opposed to Bipolar II. **I can switch through emotions very rapidly** at times. I can get very angry over nothing, but in 10 minutes I am over it. I feel as though I just react to much to some of my emotions, but they don’t last and run their course in normal time. I regret reacting the way I do and I blurt things out. In those moments I KNOW that I am overreacting.  Then reading in the bipolar reddit it learned that emotions can last for days, and Im not like that at all. I have never been suicidal but I was clinically depressed like 6 years ago, but resolved with therapy.   From what I have read in both /r/ADHD /r/BipolarReddit and /r/Bipolar  and the quick online tests I have taken, it seems like it is just untreated ADD, but there is a good chance I am bipolar. I also know that they are comorbid. But I guess I won’t know until Im back on the Adderall for a while a paying attention to my symptoms.    But I had this analogy of a phone.  Sure you are happy with a standard flip phone but once you get an iPhone you can never be happy with a simple phone. It changes your life. Do I want to be on more meds for the rest of my life? how to I know where my personality and a bipolar disorder merge?  I know I am an emotional person, and I am ok with that... its how I discern situations (I’m ENFP if that helps). I was finally in a place where I was content with myself and my brain, and now its all messed up again. **Where I was confident just a few days before I am doubting myself and I hate it.**    **TL;DR: I recently decided to go back on medication to treat ADD, the psychiatrist told me I might be Bipolar. I was confident with myself but now I find myself doubting every emotion and I am scared.**

I can't remember a goddamn thing. Did I do that Calculus homework? Did I check my email? Did I take my medicine(15mg of extended release adderall). Did I brush my teeth this morning? Did I set both of my alarms?  etc etc. I have been rock climbing at the Universities rock wall for about a year now, and have been really enjoying it. I bought some $70 shoes for myself, and have used and enjoyed them quite a lot. Well apparently I've lost them. I can't find them in my room, at the gym's lost and found or anywhere. I lost a pair of Chacos sandals this summer too. I've lost countless keys, papers, my wallet numerous times, anything. I am a broke-ass college student, so whenever I lose anything more than $10 it isn't exactly easy for me to replace. $70 climbing shoe? Forget it, no way. And I fucking love rock climbing, but it looks like that wont be happening for awhile now. It is, or was my source of exercise, my way to vent out frustration and relax. I've forgotten friend's names that I've known for almost a year and have hung out with on multiple occasions. Many people think I'm an asshole I'm sure because I keep 'forgetting' their names. Nope, I just can't remember a fucking thing. On top of all this I'm doing poorly in school, my parents are getting divorced, and was recently diagnosed with depression(shocking!) for the first time in my life.   TL;DR I'm losing at the game of life
ad975e8d846f8e975df880fa24bb2d10e9300f4c30ab217426ff208506df1d5f;;;Chain of Events;;;So my doctor wrote me the wrong prescription strength (20 Mg of Vyvanse vs 30 Mg)  I didn't notice it till I went to take a pill and noticed the color was wrong.  I figured I would give it a try and see  how well I function on the lower dosage.  I work as an independent programmer and basically use the Number of Billable hours vs Non billable house I get in a week as a metric for how well things are going.   About a week in, I was meeting with a client and ended up leaving my laptop at the restaurant.  I didn't need it for a couple of days, so when I started looking for it, I ended up doing a whole house search which thanks to ADD I have too much experience in doing.  I went to my office to check, while in my car I checked under the passenger seat and ended up 'popping' a rib with help from the armrest I was leaning over. I'll be enjoying the pain of that for about two more months.  The client reminded me that I had the laptop at the meeting we had earlier, and much to my surprise the laptop was still there.  But I ended up having to buy a new power supply to show the manager that I indeed was the owner of the laptop ($80) and left a $20 tip for the person that left it in.    I quickly fell into the old trap of staying up late to try to make up for lost time, and before I knew it morning was here and I had about 3 hours of work to show for it.   I guess that extra 10Mg makes a difference.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Anyone end up crying after a while on adderall?;;;I'm a 24/m on adderall IR 10mg 2x/day 4-7 days/wk for about five months and I've been tolerating it well in every way except one:   I'm normally pretty emotionally "speed zoned" while using it in that I experience negative emotions coldly and rationally, but positive emotions normally.   Toward the end of a week or two of consistent use I sometimes end up really emotionally sensitive and express it in odd ways, such as closing myself in the dark and crying intensely. I end up feeling despondent, cry a lot, then feel better and don't understand what I was bothered by.  Anyone else have that kind of rollercoaster?  I was diagnosed bipolar at least 10 years ago, but have been medication and symptom free for a few years through lifestyle changes. Is it likely this is what's coming up? My prescribing doctor is my PCP, not a psych, so he's useless for this.  It's not yet interfering with my life, it's just odd. Should I expect it to start becoming a problem down the road?
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Got sort-of-diagnosed, and am now drowning in anxiety. Any advice would help a lot.;;;So I began the process of being diagnosed with ADHD today. I won't go into my whole life story, but suffice to say my particular set of talents and struggles has given me a life that, on paper, looks very successful, but is a real uphill battle on the daily level.  After failing my first test in medical school HARD, I decided to see one of my school's counselors. After going over the life story I've spared you, she told me she strongly suspected ADHD and referred me to a psychologist who specializes in the disorder. I'll see him next week. Then, at some point, if I'm diagnosed ADHD and he thinks I need meds, he'll refer me to an MD.  So while on some level it's a relief to know that I might not just be a supremely lucky but incurably lazy jerk, I'm EXTREMELY anxious about the future.  -If I have ADHD, will I be able to get through medical school successfully?  -The counselor suggested that, since I'm pretty self-aware, I possibly won't need medication. Will non-pharmaceutical interventions be a huge time suck that don't get me anywhere?  -Am I actually a mediocre drug seeking asshole, like so many frat-boy friends-of-a-friend I knew in college?  -Finally, what if my psychologist DOES recommend meds, but they turn me into an irritable, unrecognizable version of myself? Or they straight up make things worse and I crash and burn in my first year of medical school? My next exam is a week away (probably won't know anything for sure by then anyway), and failing it would be a pretty big deal.  I know all of this has likely been addressed a thousand times in a thousand places, but I'm not comfortable expressing it to anybody face to face right now, so here it is on reddit (temporarily unblocked on my computer since it's friday and shit JUST GOT REAL). Any words of wisdom y'all can provide would be immensely comforting.  EDIT: Thanks again everybody. The advice and encouragement have helped. Apologies for being a little dramatic. Who knows what'll happen next, but in spite of the panic immortalized here I'm optimistic that I'll make it work. Enjoy your weekends. (also, I reworded something above that, in retrospect, was a little off)
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;college is killing me;;;physically and mentally, I am disintegrating.  Do I really need to write an organized, neat post? I have adhd too, I know we can read just like anyone else. If I stop to fuss over bolding and formatting too much, I will fail to get all this misery out onto the page. I need the catharsis, so fuck formatting. I will get to it when I'm done, hopefully.  Been here for two years, and despite the ups and downs I've only gotten worse. Took me a long time to notice the trend, because I was always getting better then worse, better, worse... trying to fix my depression and anxiety, trying to fix all kinds of things. But gradually, like the process of aging, I have reached this point and i refuse to slip further. Nothing has worked. I have fixed nothing.   First of all, I look scruffy and terrible. I should look good, I am a good-looking guy. But my hair has thinned a little, and more importantly I can't bother to put effort into my appearance anymore. Also, my misery probably shows on my face, in a subtle way. I wear the same dark jeans every day, an ugly pair of hobo-colored moccasins (I think they used to look good when they were new... can't remember), and either a black or grey t-shirt. My hair is always sloppy too.  I have studied minimalist footwear and I found a pair that is really, truly minimalist. Only problem is, a person's biomechanics need to be working properly to wear shoes like this, and the physical weight of my depression throws that off. My spine is tight and my shoulders are tense, which throws off my balance, and that works its way down to my feet and their contact with the ground. This goes away after I workout in the gym, then slowly returns.  The left side of my body seems to have suffered a gradual mini-stroke. I believe this is a stress phenomenon, meaning I don't actually have neurological damage and I could stop at any time. I've tested this and confirmed it. The problem is a result of the bad biomechanics of depression.  I have no friends either.  -  **A LITTLE MORE ABOUT ME:** I am brilliant in a narrow sense, but also mentally brittle, and a moron too. I go to Berklee College of Music, where I don't fit in. "Brilliant" because I understand things quick -- quicker than other people who say they "understand things quick." I've never met a person who forms insights quite as fast as I do, or as accurately. Oh, plenty of people have a wise worldview and deep empathy, but ... am I arrogant? ... well yeah, I'm arrogant and self-absorbed (out of fear, don't hate me please) and anyway, nobody I've met sees like I do. But this is offset by my sheer stupidity.  My inner monologue is small, quiet, nonverbal, so instead all kinds of detail pours in, and that information bounces around through the different layers of my consciousness. I notice things really fast, and I can see through many imaginative filters. Sometimes I feel like an autistic savant though, because I have these moments of being barely functional. That's social anxiety though, I think. Well, anxiety of all kinds. Sometimes I can shove aside my anxiety though and be very friendly and caring and even charismatic, but this takes a lot of effort and preparation, and I don't bother anymore because it always puts me on this cyclical manic-depressive spiral that I hate. I've succumbed to my depression wholeheartedly now. I am a pig in the mud.  Look, I don't even have a personality. Well that's not true. But my personality is wafer-thin these days, and underneath I'm a fucking alien. In person, my sense of humor is bizarre and entertaining, but underneath that I am totally morbid and serious and somber. Don't try to figure out what I'm like from this writing, who knows what kind of person you'll come up with?  Because of my sense of empathy, and my slight experience with meditation, I am really compassionate. But I also have some psychopathic traits... well one trait anyway, I'm very self-absorbed. I am so focused on myself, because for me life is this hideous struggle and I keep trying to *fix* that, to improve myself, become that smarter, stronger, and more personable guy who can suddenly handle the load.  In High School I was on the improv comedy team, like "Whose Line is it Anyway," and we were pretty popular on campus. I was also a track runner, and I nearly broke my school's shitty school record. We were not a sports-oriented school, but still this was a large public High School so that's a little impressive I think. But not very. The record was weak, as far as records go.   **AM I GETTING STUPIDER?** Intelligence thrives on joy and curiosity. Any skill is fueled by joy. Depression has replaced all of that though, I just don't give a shit anymore. That is the worst thing. Not caring is what dooms marriages, among other things. You gotta care. Life is a one-time thing.  But I don't. I don't care.  I am a musical prodigy, but I hate making music now. Every time I enter the piano practice rooms on campus, I leave a few hours later feeling drained and exhausted, and ready to eat a bullet. Do you know how painful that is? Music is my *one thing*, my existential meal ticket. I was gonna be the next Liszt or Stravinsky, adjusted to the modern music world. I'm serious. Maybe I'll still get there, if I can rediscover the joy I had as a child. From time to time I still play up a storm in the practice rooms, when I'm feeling ok.  Recently, several weeks ago, I began to study the game of Go. I progressed extremely rapidly. For a while I was just... in love with the game. I had no job, no classes. I was lazing around near the end of the summer, with nothing to do but study Go all day, every day. The game was my ticket out of purgatory.  I thought, "Yes! My life needed this. The joy of being an eager beginner, with everything to learn and nothing to prove." Now that's over already. I have no stamina, mentally or physically. My love affair with Go was violent but short-lived, I've returned to complete depression now that classes have returned. I rarely visit the KGS Go servers anymore. I still spend many hours a week solving Go problems though, and I'm sure the game will remain with me throughout my life... but I am upset. I needed to feel passionate about something, and the passion died so soon.  To be fair, I always seem to get depressed in the Fall.

I had hope during a time that was my most challenging yet, thanks to this damn pre-vet undergrad boot camp of a class list. I got my first prescription for Concerta after midterms had me strung out to what I thought was my breaking point.  I was dealing with what is notoriously one of the toughest courses at my school (Zoology), that dreaded "weed out" class with the cold, stoic professor that breaks down even the most hopeful, put-together 4.0 student. I put in at least six hours every single day for that class alone. I sacrificed my Trig grade and can no longer say the lowest grade I've ever received in college is a B. I'd heard rumors that *no one* gets an A in the class, and you have to be a genius to even hope for a B.  I gave it every single drop of perseverance I had left. I was going to fucking *own* this class and show up that professor who made me feel like stupid, incompetent scum every day that I saw her. I was going to crawl on my hands and knees through her own shit just to prove that I was dedicated.  I walked away from the first exam tired, but feeling good. It came back as a 77. I was already giving it my all. I had to ask, "How much more do I have to give?". I didn't think. I set out to find out.  I spent hour after hour reading that boring-ass book even though it took me half the day to read 10 pages. I made diagrams, I made charts that I couldn't even reach to hang up on my wall due to their size, I made over 1300 e-flashcards, I made supernotes of my supernotes and led multiple 9+ hour hardcore study sessions with my classmates. Preparing for the final was like training for a marathon, but I was in it, and backing down wasn't an option.  I got a B.  When it was all said and done, I cried my first tears of joy in months. I felt traumatized, battered, exhausted. I literally did not know what to do with my free time, and was still too tense to enjoy the new warmth of spring. I still walked away with the worst semester GPA I can claim for my entire college career. I walked away with an overall GPA down 0.27 points, barely competitive for vet school.  It was a huge fucking achievement, and I felt awesome about it on some level. Five months later, I can still probably rattle off taxonomy and anatomy as well as the day before the final.  I was supposed to take a summer class or two, to make up for those credits I lost while transferring. Come time to register, I recoiled. I was still too burnt out. I needed more time.  I was supposed to go back to school the Thursday before classes started, but I hesitated. I was still too burnt out. I needed more time. I got fully settled in to my new room the night before my first 8am class.  And here I sit, about 5 weeks later, still guarded, anxious, and tense, like a war vet with PTSD. Last semester, I had a drive, I had a spark in me that let me appreciate the little miracles in life so that I could cultivate genuine interest in the most boring aspects of the classes that drove me crazy. I got by on those little wins, that hour or two of free time I might find at the tail end of the night, those little bits of rare information that made me stop and think, "Damn, life is complex and awesome".  Now, I open a book, and see thousands of words mocking me. "You're so smart and capable when you apply yourself, but you can't. Sucks for you!" My reading comprehension is worse than it has ever been despite me feeling the Ritalin still kicking in strongly. I might as well be reading hieroglyphics, unless I slow down enough to read a sentence six times over and think about it in-depth, which I don't have time to do.  ...Until I'm reading something genuinely interesting, in which case I will fly through it, crave more, and tell everyone I know about what I read, whether they care or not.  Now, when I hit a paragraph full of things that will be a serious challenge to understand, I panic. My first instinct is to slam the book shut and go dive under the covers for comfort. I'm still so traumatized from that Zoology class that my brain shuts down the moment it has any indication that failure is inevitable no matter the effort.   My poor brain has been so conditioned over time to believe that no effort can bring the rewards it seeks. For so long, that idea was driven into it by teachers, parents, professors, and anyone else that could get a critical word in. It had no idea that it had a legitimate disorder and wasn't just stupid. It took me *years* to coddle it, gently show it how to *learn* again and be creative and use itself for better things, to regrow that sense of self-assuredness and blossom, even if it's late in the growing season.  And now, all I can think about when I turn the page and see some massive and complex diagram of some metabolic pathway with all the different molecules coming in and out and the chapter-long explanation with all of the molecule names and functions and structure, is...  "*Iamgoingtohavetotrysohard, thisisgoingtotakesomuchoutofme, I'malreadyrunintotheground, howmuchlongercanIkeepthisup, willthisbetheclassthatruinsme, nowaitIgotthisfar, Icanfinishthis, butatwhatcost, I'msofuckingtired, I'msofuckingoverwhelmed, Ishouldgodoanythingelse, nowaitI'lljusttryandparaphrasethis, I'm2sentencesinandIneedabreak, ifItakeanymorebreakstodayI'llgetnothingdone, it'sprobablynotashardasitlooks, ohnowaititISashardasitlooks...*"   And back and forth I go, fighting myself for some tiny shred of motivation. Finding none. Picking up whatever scraps I can find and running with them. Trying to drive 100 miles on a gas gauge reading "E". Flopping into bed after only getting halfway there, burnt out. Waking up an hour early just to lay in bed and feel the warmth, dreading what I have to do that day.  I spent every spare moment of the last week writing what I thought was the most bulletproof, well-written research grant proposal for a study I've been dying to get working on. I wrote it all by myself, taking it head-on with a rare bit of enthusiasm I managed to scrape together, even though it was a group assignment. I got a grade of a low C back earlier today, every page looking like a murder scene with all the red ink. Half of the "mistakes" were through no fault of my own.  But I push on, even though my attitude of "bad grade? Take that anger and make it determination to prove you're fucking brilliant at the next opportunity" is wearing thin.  Just 2 1/2 more years of this, I tell myself. Just 2 1/2 more years, and then I can *maybe* worm my way into the 4 more years that will *actually* tear me apart, in hopes of finally doing the only thing I've wanted to do my whole life.  It's only week 4 of 16. Here's to hoping that I find that spark somewhere along the way, and soon.  My ADHD college peers, we really have the odds stacked against us, don't we? Shit's crazy, but we're still at it. Here's to not giving up, even when we're looking at rock bottom from below.

It has made me an abusive asshole, a giant pussy, an arrogant bastard, and a wimp all at the same time. I'm loud and obnoxious, i impulsively shout offensive and vulgar things, breakdown crying at least twice a week, and can't learn anything or retain any information. I'm taking vyvance and anxiety medicine( forgot what it's called). After every social interaction, I feel like I've pissed everyone of and that I always fuck up and never finish anything. Why the fuck do I have to deal with this?

This sounds for the most part as a success and for the most part it is. I am unmedicated as I haven't been diagnosed since I was a child. As I learn more about what the job entails I doubt my ability to do it in a manner that won't end with me being fired, fined, or both (The job deals with information of a sensitive nature and is in a call center). I tend to make stupid small mistakes the sort that Ive heard alot about this last week that could end in any part of the aforementioned trifecta. I'm not sure if I should just tough it out for a few weeks so I can get a little money or if maybe things aren't as bad as I seem to think they are.
85dd540bbc7ca4316d7639cb7cdcee01322dd60f25cb8ed51d00826f3084339b;;;Unmedicated ADHD and moving together with my girlfriend;;;I was diagnosed with ADHD in primary school. My (somewhat new-agey) mother refused to put me on medication, I got behavioural therapy which did nothing for me, really.  Always forgot my stuff, had to change schools several times (one school was a Waldorf-School, based on the "anthroposophic" teachings of Rudolf Steiner, thank god I got kicked out of there), because of problems with aggression and overall, things were pretty meh.  Thing is, I am 22 know and this semester I will be changing my major for the second time, thankfully moving into another city with my girlfriend is, away from where my mother lives. (currently living at my mom in a separate apartment).  It took me some months to realize, that I may actually still have some form of ADHD. Of course, my mother always pretended, that I didn't have such an thing and don't need medication....and when I was older, I was just lazy, but now overall stuff makes totally sense.  - I get extremely aggressive, when I am trying to focus on something and then get torn out by some outside stimulus. Plus, I seem to forget, what I was focussing on before, which makes things even worse.  - I am just not able to focus on important stuff for long enough times. From time to time I find topics that I find interesting, be somewhat obsessive about them and then move on to the next thing. Doesn't really help you, when you have to pursue the same major over a couple of years.  - My room is untidy. All kind of stuff is lying around, from Origami-birds, to used cups, Vietnamnese coffee-filters or bent candles.   The list could go on, but you all know the symptoms.   It's just one or two more weeks here..but:  I am just bugged by being here at home, with my mother. I am bugged at being called "lazy" all the time. Sure, for some parts I am genuinely lazy. But I don't like it. I don't like it a bit, and I would love to change something about it, really.  And when I forget to do something important, or put the screwdriver in the refrigerator ... I am sorry, but I don't do that on purpose. Stop telling me, that I do this kind of stuff on purpose to freak you out. I don't need you yelling at me, negative reinforcement does nothing for me. Nothing at all - things may get even worse.  ----- So. In one or two weeks my girlfriend and I are going to move in together. The city is far away from my hometown (we are in a long distance relationship at the moment) and I am going to major in Geography, which is actually quite diverse and therefor the ideal major for me.   I have already planned a system based on extensive checklists, pomodoro technique, positive reinforcement (whenever I complete a pomodoro or wake up early, I get rewarded with points, which are roughly spaced out that one week of normal workload would equal one Pokémon-tradeingcardgame-boosterpack) and meditation.  I am just afraid of irritating my girlfriend in the long run. I don't want her to be aggressive about me forgetting to do the dishes, forgetting to put down the toilet seat or whatever it is.   ----  I am not really sure, what this post is about. Maybe some pointers on what I should do. Should I be angry at my mother for treating me "wrong" for a long time? Should I be angry at myself? Should I acknowledge, that it's not all my fault? Am I just lazy?  I am sorry, but I don't know.  TL;DR: Was diagnosed with ADHD in primary school, new agey mother refused the diagnosis. Never received a working treatment, moving in with my girlfriend and not sure, what to do.

What program should I use to do that?;;;I downloaded LibreOffice and realized...I don't know where to start or if LibreOffice is even the best tool to do this.  I haven't broken down every single step yet so I'm still at the brainstorm stage. Here's what I want to do and why I want to do it.  I want to break down my daily life as it currently relates to my mental health which I'm hoping will also reveal things about my mental/physical health and where I'm going wrong. Things like this may be immediately apparent to some but I've been in and out of psychiatrists and I've never got it quite right. I'm diagnosed ADHD at 32 years old. You all may or may not know that ADHD is a spectrum disorder that can also have co-morbid problems like dyslexia, bi-polar disorders, and depression as well as problems that aren't commonly known as genetic problems such as narcissism and stuff like that.  So my purpose is tease out any of this stuff and try and find some realizations that can be put into data and logically graphed out. Some thoughts on format include:  Do you consider today a good day or a bad day?  What time I wake up today?  Did you wake up and take a shower right away?  Did you sit down or stand up in the shower?  Did you darken the bathroom window while showering?  Did you wash your body with soap?  Did you wash your hair?  Did you brush your teeth?  Did you exercise today?  Did you smoke cigarettes today? -If so how many? -What time of day did you have your first?  Did you drink alcohol today? -If so how many? -What time of day did you have your first?  Did you feed your dog as soon as you woke up?  How many times did you take your dog out to play today?  Did you watch t.v.? -If so how many hours -When did you start watching t.v.?  You get the idea. I have a ton more personal stuff that I want to include but it wouldn't be appropriate to share my entire thing on here. However, once I'm done and have some significant data in the next year or 2, I'll be willing to share the entire data set as well as the template.  Or I'll probably just start doing it for a month and drop it lol.

(;;;Basically I want to figure out if I have add/adhd you know like a simple yes I have it or no I don't, so my parents referred me to a therapist and I have gone once and she just asked me about family stuff like how's your relationship with so and so and she never even asked about my concentration or anything having to do with adhd and at the end she was like ok see you next week but I didn't even feel like we accomplished anything. Can I just go to a psychiatrist and them like give me a test?
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Just my view of the beauty in ADHD;;;TL;DR ADHD is, in my opinion, quite an advantage in life.   ADHD is amazing. I truly see it as a gift. We have the ability to see life in a totally unique way, one without restraints or suppression. We are the ones that leave an impression. We are the ones think. It’s what we do. Every second of every hour, we think. And it’s in this thinking that allows us to be extraordinary. We have a natural attraction to high-stimuli behavior. Isn’t that the coolest ‘condition’ to have? Even as children, we were on the move. Always doing things. It’s why we fidget so much. Sure sometimes we have a hard time at fully thinking certain actions through, but it’s what makes us so unpredictable and interesting. I know the ADHD mind is difficult to control sometimes, and a lot of the time our mind just latches onto thoughts and memories we don’t want… or need, but sometimes it forces us to come to terms with those thoughts, instead of avoiding them. I was only 12 when I became truly satisfied with my understanding of life and death. I could never stop thinking about it, year after year, until eventually I felt comfortable with it. The way I see it, ADHD is like a power. It’s strong and untamed. The only reason it’s so strong is because it’s untamed. It’s free.

What are your thoughts regarding ADHD and vulnerability? How do you change your ways so you're not so vulnerable?;;;I just thought about this, but I feel like ADHD is connected to vulnerability and innocence and naivety which makes us easy targets for bullies while growing up and makes it hard for us to do things like read between the lines (regardless of age), that it's hard to balance group relationships even if we're the extroverted type, and that people can take advantage of us because we tend to be sensitive/wear our hearts on our sleeves and don't always understand social cues.  Additionally, we may forget the things people say or do because of our memory issues...Do you agree with this?  Also, I just wanted to ask a few more questions regarding ADHD?  * How do you think ADHD affects your social life and interpersonal relationships?    * What are your thoughts regarding ADHD and vulnerability?    * How do you change your ways so you're not so vulnerable?  * How to improve reading between the lines?
a74793545d71ca81a48c0e519cec1f7e37049921558d6d0daf2b6ff093f88ba9;;;I Feel Like Shit(A bit of a rant);;;I feel like shit. I feel like my life is being stolen from me. I know what I have to say is nothing new around here but I just feel like... I am nothing right now.   My 23rd birthday is coming up in a few days. I guess most guys would be happy and ready to celebrate but I just can't. I've always thrown the possibility that I could have anything wrong with me completely out the window. It's how my parents raised me. Ice skate over things and hope for the best.   With that being said, imagine my surprise when I just so happen to look into ADHD during one of my random internet binges a few days ago and find that not only do I fit the description, I'm a freaking poster boy, dictionary example of ADHD.   I never understood what it was. I never understood why I act the way I act and why it brings me pain and suffering. How I could be so intelligent yet completely bomb school, work and social life.   I haven't been diagnosed but there's just no way in hell I don't have it. Not when I've been criticized and ridiculed all of my life for being lazy, unfocused, unmotivated, under achieving, awkward, weird, forgetful and an all around waste of space. Not when I spent my childhood and early adulthood being viciously berated and emotionally abused for having what could possibly be a damn mental disability! I'm pissed!How could I possibly have any control over this!?  The best part of all this is the fact that when I was in first grade or so I had a teacher that tried to tell my mom that something was wrong with me mentally and my mom just switched me into another school. I consider myself extremely intelligent, but I can't help but wonder if that teacher was trying to tell my parents that I had ADHD and my mom just jumped the gun and flew off the handle at the accusation and never followed up on it. My mom has a short fuse, big temper and frequently jumps the gun in situations with faulty assumptions. Have I been sabotaged by my own parents? The same ones that complain about my horrible habits? All through my school career my teachers have all spoke of how intelligent I was but my focus needed lots of improvement, and I procrastinate way too much. Where could I have been today if I had just been able to get diagnosed and taught what I needed to know?   My mind is always in this fog. I forget names as soon as I get them like a dunce. I lose track of what it is exactly I'm supposed to be doing when I go to do something. I procrastinate like nobodies business. I've been called a low key genius. In fact, in English 101 I had a presentation due with over 5 partners and no one did ANYTHING I had to create the whole presentation myself at the last minute and assign everyone individual parts to read and the project passed with flying colors. I'm nearly always restless and I can't sit still without doing something, my heads always up in the clouds, I'm easily sidetracked. I talk in tangents I fear others can't keep up with. I talk fast.  I do stupid things when I'm trying to physically express myself when talking, I struggle to remember to take care of myself and do mundane things such as brush my teeth or hair. I'm always full of ideas. I get this intense irrational fear of going into a social setting like a party. I feel much the same way when it comes to driving, I can be cool on the outside, but I know deep inside I have this irrational fear that I just might fvck something up somehow someway. I hate driving, I hate distractions I don't even listen to music much when I'm driving.  My room is a pig sty. I can barely look at a schedule. I don't follow up on things that could help me. I can't keep friends. Mundane activities make me want to off myself.   All I want in life is to improve myself and succeed but no matter how many books or techniques I get I just can't go through with any of it. I. Just. Can't.   And I'm just surrounded by people that can't or don't want to understand. My familial support base is crumbling before my very eyes. I have no means of securing any psychiatrist aid or medication and I just... I don't know any more. I hate feeling this way. I feel like I'd rather be dead than live like this for the rest of my life. I don't know how I'm going to make it. I don't know how I made it this far.   I know there's not actually much anyone can do for me here but if I managed to catch your ear, thanks for listening anyways. Id be grateful for any advice or suggestions based off of personal experience.

Timeline and documentation inside.;;;Documentation of my FIRST DAY ON **RITALIN 10mg**! 18/10/2014  Male, 25yo, 79kg, highly athletic (competitive cyclist)  Recently diagnosed, never medicated before.  **10:27** | 65 bpm | Taken ritalin 10mg. Sitting on desk at pc.  **10:31** | 66 bpm | I think I feel something already going on. Slight tension on the under-eye area. Slight inexplicable sensation on chest. Kind of provokes deeper-heavier breathing.  **10:47** | 65 bpm | Checking in. Not much change. Though I feel slight change in consciousness / focus when moving head around, as if mildly tipsy. Leg muscles feel warmer and better, as if taken little magnesium after heavy cycling workout.  **11:08** | 69 bpm | Half hour in, no perceivable news. Have started working on some Uni work as I wait in front of the pc for stuff to happen and log.   **11:28** | 70 bpm | One hour in. Did the previous pomodoro (time-chunk) of work (13 minutes) without effort, although ultra-easy work complexity. Heart rate seems to jump around much more at 67-72 bpm. Don't feel any perceivable change in consciousness or focus. Don't feel less easy to get distracted.  **11:49** | 63 bpm | Just did another pomodoro of Uni work. Focusing was maaaybe a bit easier, but not nearly enough to be remotely sure it's the Ritalin. Seems like studying in the library with headphones had the same --or slightly better-- effect. Still felt the urge to check facebook etc when stuff turned more complex. Also, evidently HR dips to the low 60's when focused on work, which quite invalidates it's whole logging I guess.  Edit: FYI, I noticed that this last note took me 5 minutes to write down.  **12:40** | 68 bpm | 2+ hours in. I should have reached max methylphenidate concentration in blood plasma by now. Nothing impressive to note overall in focus, consciousness, urge to procrastinate: all pretty much normal (as in ADD normal). Maybe slightly easier to get myself to start some small task, though still familiar difficulty remains apparent. Overall it feels like something unfamiliar is going on, but too mild to pinpoint specifically, except the "mild tipsiness" I initially described. NO perceivable side effects, though, which is great!  **13:55** | 69 bpm | Just finished sending an email to a prof accepting to work on his proposal as my thesis. Took me 2 (13m) pomodoros but felt easy to start and follow through. Also easy to send my online application on this semester's courses I'll follow. Both I've been postponing  systematically. Feeling slight clenching in my stomach, but then again haven't eaten anything since morning except tea. This isn't irregular for me though (postponing eating even though hungry).  **14:17** | 68 bpm | Almost 4 hours in, Ritalin should be mostly out or on its way now. I do feel my legs getting back colder/normal and like I have to think more to write this log here and more eager to drift away.   **Verdict:** The fact that I got to write this log, is something in itself. It seems like something mildly conceivable is happening and.. that's it. I felt no particular "high", nor side effects. Was not uber-productive out of nowhere, but I definitely got stuff done (also some little things that are not narrated above), with admittedly not much effort and without postponing them really. Methylphenidate also seems to not have induced any spikes in my HR as expected, which is good for my training. It sparks my interest to see the effects on the 20mg dose, probably end of this, or start of next week. I'll (probably :P) keep you up to date.
996fe291c616a69ea898d43bc03bb76c901a6fa5dcd1a34026da2d69f9594f1f;;;Birth control and ADHD;;;Hi everyone! So I'm not diagnosed with ADHD but for a really long time I thought I had it. I still think I do. I have all the symptoms of it and I've been this way my entire life. This year I started taking birth control pills and I noticed my focus change. I no longer get distracted by every tiny thing. I can sit down and get work done that I planned to get done. I'm wondering if this has ever happened to anyone before? For me, I think a big part of it was that my hormones were always elevated so I was more distracted by how I was feeling and thats why I couldn't focus on anything. Birth control stabilized my hormones and I feel a lot more balanced. I also used to be hypersexual, now I think I'm at a much more normal level.   I realized this when I had to stop the BC for a week and I got back to the days of distractions and I also had 2 days where I just didn't get out of bed for class and sat there being lazy. It was horrible.  I'd just like some feedback. I'm trying to figure out if this is a real thing or if I'm just letting myself think the BC has this much of an effect. It could very well be me trying much harder this year to force myself to study and finish assignments and the influcence of my boyfriend who I want to make happy. But I can't help but feel the BC has a big part in it.  Thoughts? Has anyone else experienced this?

I have spent 2 days wandering around my new house. I got a LOT done, but it felt so chaotic.  I tried to put stuff away in the Kitchen, half loaded the dishwasher, left the fridge open while I was washing dishes, started 3 different garbage bags because I forgot about the one before, forgot to actually EAT for 2 days (thankfully other family members DO get hungry now and then and remind me). I also have to constantly focus because I hoard. I have had to keep telling myself "IF we need that (likely unused for more than a year small item) we are financially stable enough to replace it" so I can purge the multiple multiples of things we do not have space for as well.  Having ADHD is hard, trying to function in an unfamiliar environment is hard, trying to make SO MANY decisions on how to set things up or not changing my mind 5 mins later about where I want the cake mix to go has been Mentally exhausting.  after 4 days, I am ready to go back to work where someone tells me what I have to do and when again so I don't have to think about things!  But I have a bed to sleep on that is made, I have a kitchen table (for the first time in 5 chaotic years), I have internet (because I gave my 19 yr old son the job of getting that set up), I actually have my car IN the garage and I have a fantastic view of the fall colored trees in the neighborhood. I HAVE accomplished so much...My brain just hurts with all the thinking.
38ed2cc41489951b524dabf2763aedcd4d6115a96b0efbec745c6e836f2f88b5;;;High sensation seeking and ADHDers;;;I have been reading up on different career choices I'd like to make and stumbled upon high sensation seeking personality types. A man named Zuckerman began doing research on those with personality types that get bored fast. He called them high sensation personalities. It seems as though these types seek higher levels of stimulation not because of getting bored faster, that's just a result, but because the brain of them processes information much faster leading to the craving for high stimulation. It has also been theorized that those with adhd also have this quality. So my question is, is this why we are given stimulants, to satisfy the brains need for higher sensations so that we can allow ourselves to focus on a single task? Also does anyone have any advice on a career(s) that provide this?  Source:http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensation_seeking

I have just turned 18 and live in a 3rd world country where I cannot go to see a psychiatrist or counsellor on my own. This is mostly because I don't have the money to go alone and i cant let my family find out if I have a problem yet this problem is seriously deteriorating everything I try to do. I have been affected by a severe lack of attention for as long as I remember and it was always attributed to my lack of trying.   I have tried several screening tests online and they all told me that though I do not have hyperactivity problems that I show the symptoms of severe Attention deficiency. Yet they all say the same things. These are not a diagnosis.  If there are any online resources I can consult to make something closer to a diagnosis, please link me to them.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Can anyone who was diagnosed with adult ADHD share their "life story" and how their life improved after diagnosis? How their goals changed?;;;Hi,  I'm recently diagnosed and easing into school again where I am making up for past mistakes (sort of like remedial work) for getting into professional school. I was diagnosed late because I think my memory/intelligence let me scrape by without really studying in college (I have pretty high standardized test scores, so this is my theory).  So far I've slowly been able to get things done differently and the most dramatic thing has been that I am a lot less stressed out. Also my confidence is coming back. I'm still working on some issues with medications with the psychiatrist.  I wanted to get some additional perspective by querying people on this subreddit who were diagnosed and wondered if they could share their story. I really appreciate it. Thank you!

I recently decided to try taking it again. A lot of the side effects I think were caused by unintentional misuse, lack of understanding of ADHD (I thought meds alone would 'fix' me and didn't take a comprehensive approach), and some already existing emotional issues (in hindsight it's painfull obvious that I was depressed for a little over a year and I think Adderall amplified it).  Since this is my second attempt at the med, I really want to make sure I'm doing things "right" before I make a decision on to continue taking it or switching off it again. So I have some questions (my doctor admits he isn't the expert, so I'm hoping I can find some supplementary info here. It sems like people who actually use a drug are better equipped to answer these type of questions). **The paragraphs are to explain and clarify, but I know it's quite lengthy. So feel free to just skim for the bolded parts!**  **How long is Adderall supposed to last?**: I know that everyone is probably a little different. But what's a reasonable window of time to actively be "on" Adderall. I am having a problem where sometimes I experience insomnia. Sometimes it's obvious that I just took it too late in the day. However, I also wonder what the "proper" time window is. Last year, I realize that I was dosed up WAY too fast and that my body didn't have time to adjust. I was basically tweaking at some points. So I don't know how to tell if I just need to take my meds earlier in general, or if it's possible that my dosage might be too high and that I need to lower it for a period of time.   **What can I eat?!**: This one is important to me. A lot of people say that Adderall is an adjustment and that they lose some weight before they figure it all out. However, I don't really have a lot of wiggle room before any weight loss would be concerning. Which is bad, because the worst side effect I'm noticing with Adderall this time is the diet/appetite changes. Since my initial diagnosis, I've used marijuana to help combat this. I'd come home and smoke a bowl and it was a way to basically hit "stop" and come down from my med at the end of the day. I love weed. I'd like it to be a part of my life for a long time. But I was smoking so frequently and so much because of my medication, that the nature of my relationship with weed changed. When I noticed that my use had become more of a habit than a special treat, I realized I needed to change or risk becoming addicted. I've decided to take a extended t-break and to only use it for recreation when I start again. But that also means I need to figure out a new way to combat what's fairly bad appeite changes.  For instance: on Wednesday I hate about half a box of macaroni and cheese. On Thursday I literally ate nothing (I really did try but could literally not force myself to swallow). Yesterday I got so dizzy I had to lie down in the morning. It was obvious that my body was desperate for food. I was able to eat 3 large apple slices (about 1/2 of a standard sized apple I think). Then, very late at night, I was able to eat an entire man-which  The problem is that even though I know I need to, sometimes I literally can not force myself to eat. This has actually been something I've had happened to me before I started taking Adderall (though it was only once or twice and significantly less extreme). I would go try to eat and would literally start gagging. I'd spit up food like a baby or have such an intense feeling of nasuea that I somtimes would have to go to the bathroom for fear I might actually start throwing up. If I smell food that I don't want (which is pretty much all food), I'll start gagging as well. **It isn't just that I don't feel good or like what I'm eating. It's that my body seems to have an actual physical reaction when I try to force it that prevents me from eating**. Previously, it happened during periods where I had appetite loss as a result of anxiety. I was never able to find a way around it and simply dealt with it until I got a hold of the anxiety. This weird reaction to eating when I don't want to make it very hard to be a responsible Adderall user. It's particularly hard to make myself eat during the day because I'm in public (these aren't small gags. You can see, and often hear, them.)   It seems like a lot of people who have problems with appetite loss try to work around it. They eat large meals outside of the window of Adderall and force themselves to eat small snacks throughout the day. I am going to try really hard to do this. But there's also a lot of people who, like me, use marijuana to help combat the food issues. **I'm wondering if there's any 3rd type who knows of a non-weed way to induce hunger and appetite.**  Either way, I'm going to try to eat more and better. I just learned that ideally you should eat a substantial breakfast, wait about an hour, take adderall, and then wait at least two hours before eating again. I also learned that you should avoid highly acidic things while on it as it can mess up absorbtion. I don't know if this is true but **some people also reported noticing an increase in lactose intolerance while on it. I'm already aware of a mild lactose intolerance, so I'd like to know if I really should start being more mindful about my dairy consumption.* (I actually only notice digestive issues if I've eaten LARGE amounts of something, aka a tub of ice cream by myself in 48 hours, but a ton of dairy products will cause my face to break out like a motherfucker). I also learned that people who are lactose intolerant should avoid protein drinks. Unfortunately, this is kind of what I was thinking I was gonna do to make sure I remained healthy.  **I'm trying to find a balance of foods that are nutritious(or at the very least not bad for you), calorie dense (for obvious reasons), that work well with Adderall (like now I know that chugging orange juice is a bad idea), and that I'll be able to make myself eat.**   Most of the food advice I see tend to be about the daytime snacking food. Things like nutrigrain bars, nuts (sunflower seeds and almonds primarily), fruits (bananas and apples), and crackers being the most common. I do need help finding daytime snacks. I couldn't even eat almonds normally, so I doubt me on Adderall could do it. (They're so dry!)  **I'm also wondering about changes in diet regarding actual meals. Nothing I can think of  for dinner (or breakfast) seems appealing, which makes it that much harder to eat.** Since there seem to be overall trends in the snack of Adderall users, I wondered if that meant there were similarities in meals as well. Like an Adderall cookbook or something! (Though they'd probably need a title that didn't encourage people to associate adderall and meth more than they already do)  **What Can I Do about the muscle tension, soreness, and cramping?** I have TMD. I've already learned a lot about how to prevent grinding and jaw problems from my TMD doctor (sleeping on your back or side with a body pillow, using a heating pad, stretching your jaw, having your resting mouth be slightly open rather than your teeth touching). And my jaw got a lot better! But then I started taking Adderall....  It isn't that I'm outright clenching. I don't think I'm grinding in my sleep either (sleeping on your back SERIOUSLY helps with this FYI). But I notice that I'm overall just more tense when I'm on Adderall. I know I need to "loosen up", but I have no idea how.   I'm basically wondering if there's any food or little tricks to help combat the muscle tension and pain. I'm also starting to notice pretty constant low level calf pain (I'm in college so I'm fairly sedentary, but I walk everywhere including to and from home) and starting to get some back pain.   I'm really not a fan of medications and prescriptions. I hate Adderall. But I hate every ADHD med I've tried. I don't think I like pharmaceuticals in general. I seem, for whatever reason, to be more prone to side effects than most people. This is the reason that I've turned down my doctor for anxiety meds. It's also why I didn't pursue anti-depressants. I'd preferably like to avoid having to ask for muscle relaxants (which would be an unreasonable request for my level of muscle problems if it wasn't for the fact that I already had jaw issues before and I was already at risk of re-locking my jaws without the meds). I also want to avoid asking for sleep meds because I know how extreme those are (I can't take diphenhydramine because it gives me restless legs. The last time I tried I literally ended up doing squats at 3 am for an hour because of how extreme it was).   **Is there a way to stop switching from anti-social to overly-talkative?** Last time,I got extremely aggressive and nasty. Now, I seem to fluctuate between avoiding and craving interaction. I don't think that I'm outright aggressive right now, but **I feel like I'm less emotionally attached to people than before.** Like, I just didn't really message/text people back for like 3 days. I'd read the message and not reply to it immediately and tell myself I'd do it later. And then just never do it. Which is weird because these are my friends and I usually like talking to them. I also have no interest in men/dating/hooking up/etc. I just can't make myself give a shit. Last year I ended up alienating myself from most of my friends and it was a huge mistake. **I don't feel as actively annoyed this year, but am worried by my increase in apathy about social involvement.** I don't want to become a zombie who only goes to school and goes home to be alone.  It's particularly weird though because I'm actually super wordy on Adderall (clearly, just look at this post). I talked to my roommate for over three hours a few days ago. I noticed that when texting my best friend, I was saying A LOT in comparison to her. **It's like I swing from having no interest in interacting with other people to suddenly being TOO social.** I doubt there's any physiological way to change this side effect. But I'm wondering if people have had this problem and found any tips/tricks/rules/etc. that have helped them balance this so that they're more balanced rather than this social binge/purge that it seems like I'm beginning.  **what's a good schedule for taking these? I'm not sure if it's good for you to take breaks or not.** My doctor says thinks like "You should take it on days you feel like you need it. Don't not take it when you need it because you think you're not supposed to." But he never really explain if purposefully not taking it a day or two a week is good for you or not. I understand I should take it when I need it and not take it when I don't. But, I'm in school. I could benefit from taking it every day. Because even on the weekends I'm still studying.But I'm also doing significantly less studying. Depending on how dramatic the differences are, I might decide that it'd be better to suffer through studying sans meds on the weekend (or cramming harder during the week so I don't have to study during the weekend).  **How bad is mixing alcohol and adderall?**I'm sure it's not good, but really drinking in general is kind of just poision for your body so obviously anyone who drinks is willing to sacrifice some level of health. I'm just wondering how much worse that sacrifice becomes if you've also taken Adderall that day. **I'm also wondering what to expect if I do choose to drink.** I stopped drinking when I was on it last year. I haven't been drinking recently because I haven't really been going out,and I much prefer getting high to getting drunk. But,now that I'm not smoking, I'm sure that I'm going to start wanting a glass of wine or three on Friday nights. So I have absolutely no idea what to expect or to look out for. I'm also wondering what kind of drinks people like? I mean does anyone notice a change in their preferences similarly to how they notice a change in diet? Because I got a whiff of vodka last week (which admittedly just smells bad in general), and I'm not sure I have ever been more repulsed by a smell in my life. I kept getting ghost whiffs of it for hours after.  **Does Adderall Change what kind of foods you like or simply amplify cravings?** Sugar cravings seems to be common for Adderall. But I've read the theory that this might be due to the tendency of people to not eat enough on their meds. So, instead of adderall=liking sugar, it might actually be adderall=not eating=low blood sugar=your body craving sugar. Absolutely none of the food I have right now is appealing. I'm wondering if it's a good or bad idea to take Adderall on the day I go grocery shopping next time. If the changes in preferences is pretty stable, then it'd make sense to go while on it so that I'll know what kind of stuff my body seems to want or not want. But if Adderall just amplifies cravings, then it'd probably be a terrible idea to go on it. I'd end up buying all the food that I was craving that day, which then wouldn't be applicable to cravings I had for the rest of the days.   **Women: What sexual side effects did you notice (and how did you deal with them if you did)** The only thing I've really heard is that dry mouth also means dry vagina. But I feel like a drug that so dramatically changes so much about you must have more side effects than just needing to start using lube.
dccc51bf86a449d25d9779fc0727d00fac23436e754546fe07e918d9f2ebe81a;;;Hopefully about to be prescribed Concerta. What’s it like?;;;So I finally got it together to ring up about my ADHD assessment and, as my g/f had prophesied, they had a cancellation. Instead of waiting till the start of December (which is when it turns out I’d have been seeing someone) I was able to go along last Thursday and be seen. It was in a different town but that was fine, and I was able to take my girlfriend with me. That suited both of us down to the ground – her because it meant she’d get a chance to try to describe just what it’s like living with me, and just what the state of my life was when she first met me, living in my atrociously messy dadflat and barely able to keep enough clothes clean for myself, let alone the kids. For myself I was glad to have her along because it provided some very welcome emotional support, and most importantly meant I wouldn’t forget anything I needed to mention. More precisely it meant I wouldn’t waste lots of energy worrying that I’d forget something.  The letter had said the appointment would take about an hour. After fifty minutes of talking we had only just charted my history and it became clear that I’d have to come back a second time. My life has been a chequered one. That said, at that point the psychiatrist vouchsafed that he was more than happy to call it ADHD. Again, having my g/f along was immensely helpful, not least as I had taken along the initial assessment questionnaire which I’d been given beforehand, and on which I’d scored as “very likely to have ADHD”. Seeing that for the first time, she laughed aloud at the idea that I scored myself only a “2 – sometimes” for things like interrupting and losing things, when she’d definitely rate me a 4!  **Tl;dr** – Doctor agrees it’s ADHD and I’m going back next week to finish off assessment, have blood pressure taken etc.  The usual thing he does, he says, is prescribe Concerta. Does anyone have any idea what I can expect it to be like? My dearest wish is to be able to finish reading a book without it becoming a titanic, tearful struggle which I always lose. An even dearer wish is to be able to get on with my work (writing) but I’m even afraid to hope for that.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Concerta 36mg no effect?;;;I was prescribed 36mg concerta xr over a week ago after being diagnosed with ADHD-PI, but I feel like it's not really working. The first few days I was more motivated and way more focussed, but the effecs subsided completely. I experienced all the symptoms (irrability, loss of appetite, anxiety, etc..), but none of the effects. I took the weekend off and I can say I feel the same minus the side effects caused by the medication. After resuming medication I didn't feel any different. Is this normal?
630a5df80663c1d6c14df801231738fd523fd185d50819a1119c48ecec3dcbdd;;;A question about how thoughts work with ADHD.;;;Hello, everyone.  I've recently just started on the process to test if I have ADHD, after being on anti-depressants for a few months. It's been very stressful for me, because one day my brain feels like it's zinging around and I spend a lot of time just pacing and thinking when I should be doing plenty of other things, then the next day I just slump down to where I feel like I'm having no thoughts at all, and fall into a depressive habit of telling myself that I'm just looking for an excuse for all my past failures.  Here's my question. For those of you that have been diagnosed with ADHD, how do you feel like your brain thinks and make decisions? That is, do you always have a racing internal monologue going, or do you sometimes feel like you're just in a daze making decisions and living an unorganized life sometimes without a single word being thought out?   I've been obsessively looking through the books "Driven to Distraction" and "Delivered from distraction", and each time I look I'm either entirely convinced I have it, or I beat the shit of myself for looking for an easy answer, when the reality is that I'm just a failure that isn't trying hard enough.  ****TL;DR****  **Do you always have an internal monologue that's zipping around, or do your thoughts sometimes just disappear, and you drift to unproductivity subconsciously?**
df8dbb1ae30854ebc8922d7af00442db943262ac50db7587860f2472431fc2af;;;My Experience On Concerta;;;This is a comment on a post that I thought might deserve it's own thread.    I was diagnosed in June and my experience so far has been very positive. I also didn't know what to expect going in but I've heard the horror stories about ADD meds turning you into a zombie.   I was prescribed 36mg to start and day one I felt a little different but it was hard to explain. There was some slight dizziness and I could feel a subtle change but I couldn't define it. After a few days it began to feel like a haze that had been following me for years was starting to pass.   It was initially difficult for me to pinpoint what changes were occurring since I went on vacation and wasn't sure how much was just due to the change in scenery. But after a few months I can confidently say that the meds have helped me in my ability to pay attention and to follow things through. It's not like you take the pills and suddenly have super focus. You feel normal but when you begin a task you'll find yourself surprised by the results you get.   For example I went to my locker for lunch at work one day with the intent of grabbing one thing. When I opened the doors I thought "man this is a real mess". Next thing I knew it was 10min after lunch and I had organized my locker better than it has ever been.   Since then I've been bumped up to 54mg. The change was initially negative. I felt more hyper than I did on the 36s and had a scary moment when I forgot to take my pill until 11am, after I had already had 2 cups of coffee. Once the meds kicked in, my heart rate shot up and even just sitting on the couch it was over 100, when I'm usually closer to 85. I've been more careful about it since and haven't had a scare like that again though. But just keep in mind that there's a reason they check your heart before they give you these things.   All in all, getting meds has been a pretty amazing experience so far. It hasn't changed who I am, just how I think about situations. I hope your experience is as positive as mine.

Like the title says, it feels like I'm spiralling downwards, just waiting to hit the ground any day now.   I'm a student in my second year of law school and in the past I've generally been able to handle my symptoms fairly well. I was diagnosed during undergrad, and that marked a huge turnaround in my life. I went from being twice on academic probation (one away from expulsion), to getting 4.0 in both my last years alongside a very good lsat score and landing myself in a very good law school.  Since the beginning of this year, however, I feel like everything has been falling apart. I simply don't have the motivation to do any of my assignments, nor any of my extracurricular duties. I'm way behind on basically all my schoolwork, I've more or less skipped all of my readings, I missed applying for jobs during the normal application period, effectively barring me from all the big firms, the club I started in my first year is starting to lose their patience with me as I've been completely AWOL on all my duties, and to make things worse, my parents are going through financial troubles for the first time I can remember.  I feel like there is a big boulder that is consistently crushing down on me that I just don't know how to deal with. I live with my gf that is wonderful and accepting, but I feel like its unfair to keep putting her through this crap. I went from being a neat freak to a slob, from running 10km a day to picking up smoking again, from being enthusiastic and excited about future projects to dodging any and all responsibility like the plague, from waking up at 6am everyday to barely waking up at 11. I'm scared, angry, and don't know what to do.  I feel like everyone around me is suddenly so well organized and on top of their shit while I'm just fooling everyone around me and the gig's just about up.  I take 50mg vyvanse once a day, the same dose I've been on for the past 4 years, but suddenly it does nothing for me. I just become emotionally muted and seek to sit and play videogames or watch tv.  Has anyone here been in a situation like this? How did you get out? Any help would be amazing, because, frankly I'm terrified...
89d4401404e617031e7c7aec86a56b199385a8a57fc89dc3ddd6e81842a42c88;;;just another reminder to NEVER GIVE UP;;;Hi fellow fighters! (**long post, don't force yourself to read everything...**)  I just want to say don't ever give up, even if the future looks bleak and you can't think of anything that can make things better.  Here're 2 reminders:  1. we tend to overthink things and think the worse  2. we are just human, we can't think of every possible solutions, and also sometimes the solutions present itself outside our control. So as long as we hang on, we're giving ourselves more chances to hit that solution.  -----------  It may (no, it DOES) feel like hitting the wall again and again. It hurts, we don't understand why we won't stop, and we despair because everybody else doesn't seem to have that wall on their path.  But let me tell you sometimes there would be somebody, or something that can change that wall into a door. What we need to do is to survive until that happen. So hang on to all things dear to you, and have faith. Believe me, you'd rather die trying than rot doing nothing. It hurts, but we're not alone.  A little reminder on some things that helps:  1. Within our control: medication, exercise, diet. Also good habit and organisational tool.  2. Other's empathy, compassion and support.  -------------  Explanation:  1. I am one of those who obstinately refuse to "depend" medication or organisational tools. And I realise a lot of us are similar. then I realised, we understand why they're good for us, but we lack the willpower to carry them through. So let me preach the same things slightly more successful ADHD-er preach: **The only 4 things you need to use your willpower for are meds, exercise, good diet, and religious use of good organisational tools.** So force yourself if you have to. You have to! These will increase your ability to do anything else in life.  Will power is a scarce commodity. Use them well.  2. I hated depending on others help. I wanted to be able to do anything regardless of where or what situation I am in. This is WRONG. Other people play an important role in our ADHD battle.   Even though we can't change people, we can choose to change our environment.  - Be a well-liked person. Take interest in other people's life affair (hobbies, culture, children/pets). We do not need to be genuinely interested, that will come later, naturally. Just (try to) memorise other's affair and engage. Then people will tend to want to help you out more. - Choose not to be hurt by hurtful people. Physically move away from them, and don't listen to them. Don't even listen to the "gossips" they spread. Change boss/teacher if you have to. These people can do so much harm insidiously, you'd do good in reducing your interactions with them. - Hang in there. People come and go. Hopefully the new ones are nicer...  -----  End of my rant. Keep on fighting, people :)  ------  Who am I??? what am I doing, doling out cheery advices as if I'm made of sunshine and unicorn? The truth is my life is a mess. I hate ADHD, and I hate living life with ADHD. But I can't give up, and neither should you. So here I am talking to you as much as I am talking to myself :)  Let's show the world how amazing we are :)
fa9d7f46d021146edc6fc7745aeea4c3bc873b5a5c546d85e5757b2f7dc687ad;;;The Dextroamphetamine was working but apparently my body hates me as much as my brain does. I am so upset now.;;;I have been on Dextroamphetamine Spansules for 6 weeks now and it actually started working. I was so happy and relieved!  My sugar cravings were cut back significantly, easier time regulating my emotions, not self medicating with food anymore, focus was a bit better (still not great, though.) Working memory was only slightly improved. It was likely that i needed one more increase in dosage and was going to discuss this with my psychiatrist at my next appointment.  Well that increase won't be happening now. The tachycardia that was the reason I had to quit a number of the other drugs I have tried  showed up. I am so upset right now, can't stop crying.   Intuniv and Focalin are the only two I have not tried. Focalin is off the table due to the tachycardia/high blood pressure i had with other methylphenidate based drugs.  Coaching and CBT are fails for me as well. Intuniv is now my last resort. If it does not work, I don't know what I will do.    TL;DR: Dextroamphetamine started working (YAY!), but tachycardia strikes again (FUCKFUCKFUCKFUCK!), Intuniv only drug left to try. Coaching failed, CBT failed. Probably fucked for life, crying eyes out.  .  .  Drug list (only want to type this once...)  Wellbutrin: made ADHD worse, not great for depression either.  Ritalin: High blood pressure, slightly effective  Strattera: Tachycardia (given lopressor to combat that. resting heart rate went from 125 to 90ish), some effect but eventually nothing except sugar cravings gone.  Vyvanse:  No side effects. very slight response for first three days, then fuck all for six weeks.  Dextroamphetamine Spansules: Tachycardia, but was starting to work.  Concerta: Tachycardia, did sweet fuck all.
dccc51bf86a449d25d9779fc0727d00fac23436e754546fe07e918d9f2ebe81a;;;ADHD being perceived as a "fad" disorder;;;Last night I mentioned in passing to my sister-in-law that I've got ADHD. Cue eye-roll: "Oh, what, have you been doing a Buzzfeed quiz or something?"  I've had similar reactions over the years as stepparent to an ADHD stepson (and an aspie stepdaughter). Both seem to trigger this thing in people where they assume it's a vague self-diagnosis and it's up to me to prove its validity to them. I just wondered if anybody had any thoughts on why this should be, and what a constructive response would look like. There's no point in me getting cross (usually) but if I could find the right way to gently suggest that these are serious issues that warrant being taken as seriously as any other diagnosis, I might feel less like I'm wasting my time mentioning it.
94edbea177efeeb32b1305b3c90db9f20579680758ede227f32643ea539fc440;;;[RANT] Why is when I do something productive, my medication gets the praise?;;;Hi all!  I was diagnosed at with ADHD at 20, and it still took a few months before I was tried on stimulants. The doctor wanted to try absolutely everything else first (which is fine with me). I was put on Adderall XR over a year ago (August 2013), and it worked wonders for me. I have tried others because the XR gave me horrible side effects, and now I'm on 20mg IR 3x a day (but I usually only take 2x daily), and it is fantastic.  I'm finally able to get more stuff done, I'm able to be productive. It feels really good to actually start/finish something before the night before it's due! It's amazing!  However, just about anybody that knows that I have ADHD and that I take medication for it believe that it's just the medication that's doing all of this. The one that hurts the most, is my mom. Anytime that I get a lot of work done, or something along those lines, or I have a night aide at work that requires me to be awake from 11p-7a, she always attributes it to my medication! My mom and I have a GREAT relationship, but it kills me whenever she says this.  I'll wake up for class at 7am on a Friday, go to class, homework, and hang out until about 10.30, then leave for work. I space my pills out a little, so that I can take one later at night, so that I can focus for work. But when I tell my mom about it later the next day (on the phone, I'm away at school), she says that, **"It must help to be on medication that keeps you awake."** EXCUSE ME?!?!???!  Whenever I do housework when I go home, it's attributed to my Adderall helping me or making me do it. No, it's not. My Adderall helps me function and to actually apply myself the way that others apply themselves, so why is it seen that it's ONLY the medication that works??  During group projects at school? Oh, Quixotic can do it. He's on Adderall so he can stay up all night and nothing will phase him. NO! My medication helps keep me calm, it DOES NOT affect me like it affects others without ADHD.  People will come up and ask me if they can buy some of it off of me. Excuse me, are you stupid?? No. I'm not selling my medication that helps me. It's illegal, and it ALMOST brings me to the level of functioning that you have on a regular day.  My girlfriend understands (well, at least as well as she can), so why can't my mom? Why can't others? I love my mom, we've always been close, but this absolutely kills me.  It's me whose doing all of this! Not my medication!  **TL;DR** Just about everybody attributes my getting stuff done to my medication.

Extreme anxiety, and a strong fear of becoming addicted.;;;I am a 26 year old male, 2nd year software engineering undergrad. About a month and a half ago I did an Psycho-Educational Assessment with a Psychologist who concluded that I have ADHD combined type as well as social anxiety and depression (but the depression is cause by my lack of academic achievement and social anxiety)... He (the psychologist) suggested that I take medication. Two days ago I went to see a psychiatrist in order to get a prescription, I told her about the result of my assessment from the psychologist and her response was that she doesn't work in the same way as psychologists do and that there's a possibility that I might not have ADHD according her assessment and I was ok with that...  She asked some questions which I answered and concluded that I have ADHD (btw, although I answered honestly, I believe any person can cheat by knowing the related symptoms and get a false diagnosis). She prescribed Adderall 10mg for 1 week and then 15 mg for 3 weeks, she thought that 10mg and 15mg were a good start but not enough and that I'll need a higher dose.I am scheduled for another appointment in a month, after taking all the meds, to see the results and maybe increase the dosage... I asked her if I could become addictive and her answer was no, and I also asked her if I can take breaks from meds, when I am on vacation or don't need to focus... she said that this is your medication and you need it EVERYDAY FOREVER to function. I have been doing "ok" without it for 25 years and I mainly needed it now because of the work load in school...    So I took my first pill two days ago with food, and I noticed the difference, even though the psychiatrist thought that I won't feel anything with 10 mg. I was calm and more focused and I could block surrounding sounds, but I also felt like I was someone else, I was also looking forward for the end of the semester to stop taking these meds... at night I was tiered but it was a very strange feeling, it was as if my mind is not letting my tiered body to go to sleep. the second day I took my second pill, it was very different from the first day, although I was calm, I was worried about the fact that I am taking a very addictive drug, and I started browsing the web for more information, and always end up getting conflicting results, but the general consensus is that it is an addictive and dangerous substance.... my family has been very worried fearing the side effects and the highly possible addiction (which increased my anxiety and worry) especially my mom, who doesn't like meds (so am I to a certain degree). The information that I got from the internet and my family's concerns elevated my anxiety... but I think it's mainly the side effect of the drug... Btw I don't classify my self as a person with an addictive personality, I have a slight eating disorder...Now I am going through an obsessive internet phase seeking even more information on the matter (Meds).... Today is my third day and I woke up suddenly with an extreme anxiety and discomfort, I felt like a drug addict or on the verge of becoming one.   I was asking my self what am I doing to my body and to my life, it was scary... The only thing that I was thinking is how to stop taking it... My anxiety level is fluctuating... Sorry about this long, unedited and slightly boring post this is the first thing I did after waking up anxious and felt like letting it all out in hopes that this could help me and it did...   Does anyone have any advice or similar experience with Adderall?... Should I stop taking it? Is this a sign that medication is not for me?
bb939885881f95bc650576661fc0aecc91fd706f5ee55b9bb62c051052d20a66;;;I need to work on my daily routine, could use some help!;;;I was diagnosed with ADHD about an half year ago and at first it was going well and it still is. The thing is that I haven't made any progress the last few months and that is killing my spirit. I use ritalin on a schedule and I have an app for that. That is going great. The rest of my daily routine, yeah...  I need to sleep more but I think quite a few can recognise the fact that it has magically become 2am. Besides that eating regularly is a real struggle, I LOVE to cook but I just don`t have the structure to actually do that often enough. There is many more things related to my daily schedule that I am not happy with but I think you get the picture.   I have managed a few times to have a good schedule but after about a week I drop out it and it is just so hard to get back in.   Do you guys have any tips on how to create a daily schedule and how to stick to that?(for longer than a week)   I study computer science so tips on apps to use/website are also very welcome.  I finally found the energy and motivation to start working on myself again and become a little happier, step by step I will manage but a small push in the right direction could be very useful.  Thanks in advance, you guys already have given me so much inspiration just browsing this subreddit :)
c1ad8d7ed075175134472164b99d7bfcfb97024d741bbf73cf537a30ce04a82e;;;[Off my chest] Diagnosed recently, but with complications for meds;;;So, I've spent the last couple of weeks reading through the sub, and it seems like a delightfully supportive place, and therefore I feel comfortable ranting a bit here, as I think at least some of you will understand. (Though I'm still using a separate account, just because...)  I got diagnosed ADHD-PI a few weeks ago at age 31. Being a woman and always considered gifted, I've basically flown under the radar all my life, but I've also always been painfully aware that I was never performing as well as I felt like I could be... but who was I to complain, since I was always doing so well?  All in all, I was always managing with the least amount of effort, both academically and professionally. I've actually managed to hold down a well-paying full-time job for 10 years where I always get praise for my efforts... despite actively working *at most* 20% of the time I'm at the office - made worse by a somewhat recent office move where we now have an open office plan - curse the inventors of that!  I also somehow managed to get into university, despite never finishing high school (dropped out 3 times), and also managed to finish all my courses there (with grades ranging from A to D, depending on how much logic I could apply to the subject and/or how much I could ~~bullshit~~ cram the last few days before exams).   I always felt like everything was hard to start, I couldn't motivate myself etc. etc., but I never considered ADHD until I met my current bf, who himself has ADHD-PI, which of course led me to read up on it... and it was basically like reading about myself. I found my people! So yeah, I suspected it, but I was afraid that I wouldn't be believed if I went for a diagnosis.  I'm currently writing my final thesis, and it's just... not working out. Procrastination and fear of starting is keeping me from getting any work done, and it's making me absolutely miserable.  The feeling that everything was spiraling out of control more than ever finally led me to contact my GP, who sent me to a psychiatrist, who quickly diagnosed ADHD-PI (from an interview, no standardized test). The guidelines here say that if a psychiatrist prescribes stimulants, you have to get a few blood tests and an EKG done, so I did that as well.  Here's the thing. That EKG showed a 1st degree AV-block. In itself nothing to worry about - it's pretty normal, discovered randomly and gives me absolutely no symptoms and could very well be because I'm in quite good physical shape; however, it has delayed starting medication for a few weeks as psych wanted a go-ahead from my GP; precious time when it comes to my thesis, which is due in a month from now.  The end result is that I start medication in a week from now (methylphenidate, as that's what's available, and likely Ritalin to start - dexamphetamine is very rare and hard to get here, and Strattera is not a common choice either) - and the first couple of weeks I will have to go in for an EKG every day or two (thank fuck for socialized medicine, and that it's an in-and-out in 10min thing, and located 500m from my job).  All in all, I'm feeling a bit weirded out by the entire process:    - First of all, it felt really... transgressive talking about this with a stranger. My only other experience with the mental healthcare system was a visit to a psychologist 12 years ago in relation with a depression, and she was more interested in why I wore black clothes and if I had an eating disorder than actually listening to me, so I never went back.   - The feeling of relief when the psychiatrist agreed that I fit the diagnostic requirements of ADHD-PI, and that he could understand that all my coping mechanisms were only getting me so far, and that medication would probably help, was immense. It finally validated my feelings that there was something different about me; I wasn't just stupid or lazy.   - Suddenly randomly finding out that I have a heart problem, however minor it is, had me quite worried; not so much for my physical health, but that it might put a stop to being medicated.   - Hearing from my GP (not my psychiatrist) that medication was still a possibility, though it requires close monitoring to begin with, has made me somewhat hopeful again. Now I just hope that finding the right medication for me won't take forever.  All is not lost regarding the thesis. I'm still hoping I can finish it in time (and without pulling all-nighters a couple of days before like I would have done otherwise). It'll be hard work, but it's doable; and if not, it's not the end of the world as I can fairly easily postpone the deadline 3mths, but I don't want to, and it would be nice to finally have that sense of accomplishment; something to prove to myself that I'm not dumb.  And finally, it would be great to not constantly kick myself over not being able to motivate myself at work. To actually be able to work for more than 20% of the day. To filter out the distractions and not come home completely bombed out and unable to do anything else for the rest of the day.  So yes, I'm hopeful despite it all, and will definitely use this opportunity to build - and cement - some good habits.  Thanks for listening ;)  **tl;dr: Diagnosed ADHD-PI, but routine EKG prior to medication also discovered a minor heart problem, so the whole process has been a bit... bumpy.**

What do?;;;I have seen the first psychologist for a few months now. She says I don't really have ADHD and that I have "anxiety disorder, not otherwise specified" instead. I have attended 6 cognitive behaviorial therapy sessions thus far, and, although the coping mechanisms don't really help, I have been able to learn more about myself and how to make sense of my life and tendencies. This intimate knowledge alone has proved to be very useful sine I have always been one to bottle up my emotions and not really reflect on them.  A week ago, pretty much on a whim I decided to see another psychologist in order to be evaluated for ADHD. I was upfront and honest about the former psychologist's diagnosis but wanted a second opinion. This clinical psychologist recorded my personal history, had my family fill out a behavioral assessment on me, and also had me take a CPT test.   Long story short, the second psychologist strongly believes I have ADHD-PI and recommends that I see a psychiatrist in order to be prescribed meds. He has also recommended reading the book Driven To Distraction as well as works authored by Dr. Barkley.  Who am I to believe now?
f97b235c057092019e67fb571e1afbf299f0d5e20883091353b561a181d0c45e;;;I want to get tested but I don't know where to start;;;Be prepared, this is gonna be long. I'm sorry in advance.   I'm currently 19 years old and am female. I'm in college and I've recently realized I've been showing a lot of the symptoms for ADHD and that I've been showing them for a while now. It's been affecting my life negatively especially in my social and academic life. Because of this, I've had to drop two classes this semester which is something I've never done before (it's my second year in college). Long story short, I am very interested in getting tested and mainly getting help to build better habits.   I've done all the research to know what my next steps look like but my family situation may be the thing that holds me back. I moved out two years ago but am still financially dependent on my parents (having a bum of a daughter would make them look bad). My father is very narcissistic and has been abusive towards me in the past. My mother has essentially neglected me throughout my life. I haven't been to the doctor in more than 5 years.   I live in the US so I know I have options but I would like to know what they are. I want to be able to go to the doctor for a general checkup and to get tested for ADHD but I don't want my parents to know. I wouldn't be able to have anyone give any information about my childhood because I never had any close friends or close parental figures throughout it.   So I guess what I want to ask is can I go to the doctor using my insurance without my parents knowing? Should I go to a general practitioner first because I haven't been to one in so long? Or should I find a therapist? I'd there any way of keeping this from my parents?   I feel like this is affecting my life too much and I really need professional help with either diagnosing me and getting treated for that diagnosis, or just getting help with ways of slowly fixing things if I end up not getting diagnosed with ADHD or anything else.   Thanks in advance for any comments
4ee2e64070e1d9b9de08692798365787cdec7e170cd22de01d3d71c01a4c1692;;;ADHD and School Anxiety; TW: Suicide;;;So, a common theme in my life is that school makes me anxious and depressed. I am sure my problems with ADHD do not help. I actually think the extra effort I need to spend on school triggers my anxiety.  This semester is a train wreck. It started off with promise. However, I made my job a priority and got behind in physics. I kept trying to play catch up in physics and ended up getting behind in calc II. Then, I found out I was getting a D in physics. I was determined to turn it around, and I put in a lot of work to try to do that. I had a calc test in that time.   Well, I was taking my physics test, and while I don't think I was failing miserably, I felt a lot of brain fog while taking the physics test. I had a lot of anxiety, and I just wanted to drop the class. I went home feeling suicidal. I woke up in the morning and found out I got a D on my Calc II test. I understood the concepts, but I had trouble understanding what a couple of the questions meant due to wording. I ended up feeling very strongly like I wanted to kill myself, so I went to the emergency room.   I didn't get diagnosed with ADHD/GAD/depression until I was 25. I am 28 now, and my trip to the ER was the first time I got treatment for my ADHD. I tried before but was prescribed Zoloft, which I didn't care for. Well, tonight, I had a calc quiz due, and I've been avoiding it all weekend. I just missed the deadline by 4 minutes while working the problems, but I was having trouble thinking because of the anxiety again. Now, my anxiety is through the roof, and I'm having those suicidal feelings again.  I've been in college for 10 years because this is a repeating motif in my life. I don't know why, but school makes me extremely anxious. The ADHD coupled with the anxiety makes it near to impossible for me to concentrate on school work, and they also make me feel tired all of the time.   I don't know what to do. I don't want to give up on school, but I am about to run out of financial aid, so I don't know if I'll have any other choice soon.   Anyone out there with similar experiences? Advice?
ae3a0067c9deb38546867f43c1f78804d7befe485e405484c813fee3e6176129;;;[UPDATE] So I finally had a follow-up evaluation and a diagnosis.;;;I went with the specialist treatment center, as I would have had to wait for a new PCP to give me a referral and wait again to be seen by a psychiatrist.   And well, I was officially diagnosed with ADD, or ADHD-PI, on Tuesday.   I found the appointment pretty surreal. On one hand I am glad to finally be addressing this issue, and on the other I just never saw myself as having the disorder. I have seen countless therapists over the years to deal with short-term depression / depressive episodes and the SSRIs I was put on were zombifying. I always assumed I'd be in and out in treatment for depression; it was not until a therapist urged me to complete further evaluation that I even considered ADHD, even with my diagnosis from college.  My psychiatrist told me that medication would be helpful for me. I took my first dose of Adderall XR (25 mcg) on Sunday, just to make sure it wouldn't do anything unsettling during the workweek. It was not as bad or different from myself as I thought it would be, but it's still very different from what I'm used to. For one thing, I CANNOT take any caffeine with it. I made a mistake of taking it at 2pm yesterday and had a regular Coke in the afternoon. I was up until 2 am!  The only thing is I'm not sure what to do after my follow-up sessions (mostly to review my medication and progress) are over. I am trying to find a therapist that specializes in CBT versus talk therapy and I'm not sure where to start w/ that. Dr. really surprised me as we talked a lot about my history over the course of the evaluation (I thought only therapists did this). He seemed more hopeful for the long-term benefit of seeking treatment than I did.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Is it just me?;;;Does anyone else try to predict how the conversation will go with people in your head? I feel like my brain is going 10 million times a minute which runs through all the possible responses someone will have to what I say. I think this is why I get bored and distracted from conversation. Also does anyone else feel like they are funnier due to your ADHD? Because i think of what peoples responses would be, I know what to say next and  i feel like it has made me witty. Im not sure. I hope this made sense
4af7c5d58e53d3731b17d3fba9bb8f774c1ea12b476cc1e6b2762f407f19dde4;;;[RANT] Regular drug tests and moralism;;;I would obviously appreciate any guidance on how to deal with this, both practically and emotionally.  Background: I recently got diagnosed. At first they said it was only a type of unspecified attention disorder, but later they told me the criteria for ADHD had changed and now also included people who first had symptoms before the age of 11. I don't really get the whole thing. I know I've had issues resembling ADHD throughout my life, but I've also had a very difficult upbringing, and it wouldn't surprise me if that hadn't affected my cognitive abilities etc. The medication (Concerta) has helped me with studying, planning day to day life and dealing with social settings. The latter is very important to me.   But to the issue, before the testing I told them I smoked every now and then. They told me to stay clean for 3 months before any testing could be done, so I stayed clean. Then they wanted me to stay clean while they tried out the medication. Fine, that all makes sense, they want to make sure the symptoms aren't caused by the weed, and they want to make sure I'm on the right dosage. Before getting my first prescription, however, they made me sign a paper stating that I understand that the conditions for the treatment is being drug free. This means that I will have to do regular drug tests forever. This also applies to ADHD patients with no drug history. If you refuse to take a test, or test positive, they'll withold medicine for 3 months and then you need to show that you're clean.  Even though there are no official health guidelines stating that you need to be 100% drug free to receive treatment, there are also no official guidelines stating you have the right to treatment if you're not. From what I've understood though, in 99% of cases they end the treatment with any kind of positive drug test. I've also heard of cases where they've ended non-pharmacological treatments, like therapy, when there's been a positive drug test. From what I know there isn't a dangerous interaction with marijuana and Concerta (methylphenidate hydrochloride), so it seems like the only purpose of this practice is to punish patients who don't have a lifestyle healthy enough according to their standard.  I've been on the medication for a couple of months, and was finally assigned a new doctor (the Swedish psychiatry is very chaotic..). I had to tell her everything again, describe symptoms, describe in detail how an anxiety attack "feels like in the body", give a quick summary of years of therapy and mental health problems, and finally she asked about the "time when I was using drugs". She asked me "why did you use? was it to calm down?". But I've actually never felt like my use has been problematic for me, but that's so taboo to say in Sweden. So I said "I did it because I liked to get high" which was truthful but also really stupid. She then mentioned I was going to have a new nurse assigned to me, so that I could have "testing done".   "What kind of testing?" "Oh, blood testing, checking your weight... liver status, you know standard procedure stuff".  And I just felt like she was intentionally not mentioning the drug tests. And I already had all the regular blood testing, EKG and liver status testing done during the  first 2 months when I was started taking the medicine.   This whole thing with the drug tests are stressing me a lot, I obsess over it. I search for policy documents regulating the practice (non-existent) and ADHD organisations talking about it. I'm involved in organisations supporting drug user's rights so simply the ideology of it angers me. I think that all medical decisions should have medical grounds. I haven't smoked since I moved back to Sweden (used to live in Berlin, where people smoke up in bars). The laws are very strict here and even if I wasn't going to be tested I would probably not even smoke more than once every couple of months. So it's not the fact that I can't smoke that is upsetting me. But I feel like these tests are really humiliating and controlling. I also hate that I feel like I get punished every time I talk about drugs in a honest manner with health care professionals. The first time I mentioned having smoked the nurse got edgy and irritated just because I didn't agree that smoking weed gradually lowers your IQ. I'm upset that they can terminate my treatment on grounds that aren't medical. Should my medication really be a reward for good behavior? I've always hated all kinds of authority figures, but this is just taking it to a new level. It also makes me want to stop with the medication, to not have the anxiety over the drug tests anymore. But the medication is helping me a lot. I feel like I can finally have something of a normal life. It feels like it would be self destructive to stop taking the medication before I have more tools to deal with my issues. I go to a CBT-therapy group that I hope can teach me some things.  **TL;DR:** Need to take regular drug tests to get treatment. This is making me very upset.
6ad5ff384a494f3e259ccbcd6530ec990bcd6be0ceaeed1606e2aa1399efa80f;;;Should I see a psychologist or psychiatrist?;;;Okay, so I'm 26 and I was diagnosed with ADHD by my old primary family doctor a few years back.  He gave me a prescription for adderal XR 20 mg twice daily.  It seemed to help a lot for the first year or so I was on it, but within the last year or so, I've been having some issues.    Ive been getting mood swings, and bouts of feeling depressed.  Sometimes its the smallest things that make me tip over the edge.  I always thought that I was good at handling stress and it's just been really tough the past year or so.    Also, I've always been a really social person, and my job relies on me being social, but as of the last few months it's been really hard for me to interact with people, and I feel like I haven't been doing my job as well as I could.  I'm avoiding interacting with people, and it just makes me feel like shit, to be honest.    Anyways, I know I need help, and reading a lot of what you guys go through has really made me open my eyes to how many things that I experience with ADHD that are normal.  I've never actually gone to a psychiatrist for a specific diagnosis or anything.  I'd really just like to talk to someone about things I can do and how my disorder is affecting the things that have been bothering me lately.    What are your experiences with psychiatrists and/or psychologists?  How has it helped you?  Do you have any suggestions for me?  I'm just a little down and lost right now and haven't been feeling myself, so any info would be really helpful.  Thank you

What are some experiences with effexor for ADHD-Inattentive?;;;I was on Adderall XR 25mg which worked really well for me but for some reason it only worked for about 4 to 6 hours. Not nearly long enough when I have a 12 hour work day plus school. My doctor and I talked about moving off of a stimulant to something that would work constantly throughout the day. Her first recommendation was Straterra 60mg twice a day and then 80mg twice a day. I have been on it for over a month with nothing but constipation and a serious lack of motivation(more so than usual). She is recommending the next step is to try out Effexor due to its promising results in some studies to treat ADHD-Inattentive symptoms. I was just wondering if anyone has gone through this type of situation and if so what was your experience on Effexor? Was it effective? Any really bad side-effects?   P.S. If all else fails we have already discussed moving back to stimulants  .

I also have ADHD, it was diagnosed when I was very young and have been medicating for most of my life. The last 2 years, I have struggled with my classes and grades, I had no motivation to do anything. Well at the beginning of this year,  I finally started getting on top of my work.   As of 2ish months into school, I currently have all A's and B's in my classes, most of which are AP classes. I have been on top of my studying, realizing that waiting until the last second is the worst and managing your work in small chunks makes school SO MUCH EASIER. When the new Super Smash Brothers game was on the horizon, a midnight release was announced. That following day I had a Calculus test worth 20% of my semester grade.  Against my father's judgement, I went, believing I was ready. I had a great time at the midnight release.  And guess what.  I FUCKING DESTROYED THAT TEST.  It has been a long time since I have seen my dad that happy with my grades.  I am spewing this out to tell you guys that I finally had a breakthrough, even though I thought I never would. Keep trying, you guys can do it!
9e070852a75016670293bf65e8bf6d55388df3a8ae8519111dd3b49ebc09a751;;;Update: Mom of Teen Girl with Possible ADHD - "Voice";;;My original post is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/2ina0m/need_helpadvice_with_my_daughter_age_13/).  **TL;DR: My daughter says she hears a voice that tells her what to do. I think maybe there's another explanation.**  We've started the process of getting my 13-year-old diagnosed. She was tested and diagnosed with ADHD when she was six, with the main problem being 0% impulse control. We're getting a second opinion now, since she's so much older. It appears that testing will cost around $4,000 if insurance doesn't cover any of it.  The newest thing is that my daughter has told me &amp; now told her school counselor that she hears a voice named Rose who tells her what to do.  *(Rose is the name she wanted to call herself for years when she was little, and she named many of her dolls Rose. Also, if it helps, she loves ghost stories.)*  A quick google told me that many adolescents say they hear voices, so I haven't been too concerned. The school counselor is freaking out.  **This is my interpretation:** I think the "voice" is her way of reconciling with herself behavior that she feels she can't control but is deeply ashamed of. Maybe it is some personification of how she wants to act versus how she's trying to act. Either way, to me it signals that she really does need help with the impulse control now. Beyond that I'm not worried about it in terms of really serious mental illness or anything.  In the meantime I guess I would like to draw on the huge collective experiences here.  **Is this the sort of thing a struggling ADHD kid might do to deal with her feelings about her own behavior?** She is a very tender-hearted kid who really wants to do the right things and is maybe overly empathetic with others. I view her as feeling maybe out of control or unable to do the right things, even if she wants to.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;I have thrown away a perfectly good relationship several times and I'm worried my ADHD is the reason why.;;;I'm a 20 year old guy in my junior year of college. I had been dating my 21 year old girlfriend for a year until I broke up with her for the third and final time. I'm convinced my ADHD has prevented me from being an adequate boyfriend for a decent amount of reasons.  Like I said, I had broken up with her twice before this time earlier this month. Both times she let me come back to her after realizing I had mad a mistake. She understood I was going through tough family issues and that I was trying different meds to sort out my ADHD, and I am eternally grateful that she was willing to give me another chance each time.   But the issue is with me, and the fact that I would run away at the slightest problem. I expected her to fight harder to keep me (which I know was wrong of me to expect), and when she didn't I was lost. Since the first time we split, I had alternating weeks of emotions. For a month or so at a time I would be head over heels for her, ready to spend forever together. The following month was almost the exact opposite. I still loved her just as much but the thought of planning a lifetime together was too much and I caved and it split us apart. But there's no going back this time, and my fear is that my ADHD is going to continue to be an issue in this area.  I'm not asking for relationship advice or how I can get her back yet again, because I've accepted that you only get so many chances. I really just want to know if this issue makes sense. Or if maybe there is another disorder lying underneath that hasn't bee diagnosed yet. Or maybe if this is something that's been a problem from anyone else in the past.  Apologies for the rant.

I go to school 3 hours from home, and my parents mail my prescription to me. They put it in the mail (at the postal office) last Monday, and it's still not here. What the hell am i supposed to do? i haven't been off it in years, and I've just gone 3 days without it. I'm freaking the fuck out. Can anyone help?
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Driving issues with ADHD;;;Hey all. I've had 2 accidents over the past 6 months and life has turned into a wreck. I'm only 20 years old and I've stopped my medication for ADHD. Both of my accidents were caused by not paying attention.  I can't take medication because it changes me into someone I don't like. I'm not fun and exciting anymore. I'm a robot. I hate myself on it but everyone loves me more, including my family when I take it.  Right now, my aunt wants me to quit my job, get one closer (I've been with this job for a year and a few months) get a closer job, and ride a bike. Or take the bus (I don't trust buses, plus the bus schedule here does not fit my work schedule.)   I KNOW I had two accidents in six months, but it drives me up a wall that my aunt wants to baby me and act like i don't know how to drive when it's an attention issue.  This most recent accident was solely because I was at the wrong place at the wrong time. I took a turn 3 seconds after someone was pulling into the parking lot I was leaving, and by the time his trunk cleared I could not avoid the car heading towards me. I was turning left. Even though my car was totaled and the other driver admitted fault, I still got the ticket and points on my license. If I would have just waited I would have been perfectly fine; or even if I took a safer route and just did a u-turn.  My mom and dad act like its so easy because they don't understand what it's like. All they keep telling me is to "take your medication. We like you better when you take it, everyone does." It kills me to hear I'm not "good enough" for my parents. Even if it's going to benefit me in the end, I don't want to fulfill their fantasy of a perfect son.  anyone have any advice on what I can do? Since this accident I have been driving extremely careful and being 100% safe with everything I do, but I'm still getting flak and stupid suggestions from my relatives (like I'm going to actually quit my job where I get paid well and move so I can ride a bike to work, and learn to drive from her).  Thanks.

I'm probably one of the most inconsistent persons I've ever known. I can't manage to take my meds consistently for more than a week even though I'm usually at my most motivated, most inspirational, most composed person I've ever been when I'm on them. Essentially, my meds turn me into the person I've always wanted to be.  Yet, despite knowing that person is within my grasp, I can't seem to take my meds...and so I'm left with the self who struggles.  How about you guys?

So she cancelled all the appointments for the following weeks. Mine was one of the cancelled ones. After waiting for more than a month for it. Now the earliest I can get another appointment is in December.  I was diagnosed by my psychologist about two months ago, can't remember if more. He's certain I need medication but can't give it to me. We've been working on coping mechanisms lately but they don't help much. I can't even remember to write things down and have trouble paying attention, even to him.  I don't have health insurance. I have no other psychiatrist to go to, they all give out appointments for late December at the earliest. I had to drop classes and I'm not doing well on the rest, even if I try. I can't read much. And now I'm not even the least bit motivated to keep going.  Ugh I'm so tired.

I'm now on medication (18 mg Concerta) and it's really changed my life. I never have been thrilled about resorting to medication for things, but this is a definite exception. I finally am genuinely enjoying life.  &amp;nbsp;  Anyways, I realized before meds I just had to become strategic at managing the symptoms: running long distance, avoiding refined sugars and unhealthy food which caused highs and lows, and rarely, if ever, drinking alcohol. I still do these things which helps, but I wanted to ask...  &amp;nbsp;  **In what ways do you manage your ADHD aside from medication? What sports or activities help? Do you have any dietary suggestions that have worked for you? Or didn't work for you?** Thanks!

I have problems I observed since young. I went to a GP today asking for a referal to psychiatrist about my issues. He said that it was near impossible for me to have ADHD because "if you had it, it would have been detected earlier." Also, had I have it, I wouldn't have gotten into my pretty decent high school. But that's the fucking problem! I tried to explain that it likely would have been due to the fact that ADHD-PI is harder to spot and many adults only get diagnosed when they're much much older, which is why I suspected I had an issue. He also said that my school cousellor and teachers hadn't said anything about it or even suspected it, thus it was unlikely.  Honestly, can we really count on every teacher in the american school system to know these things? I'm just really sick of this all my underachieving, and I really think I can do better than running late for apointments I woke up four hours early for, forgetting to lock the door, leaving my keys in the fridge, losing friends because I blurt out stupid things, being a fucking drag during conversations because I can't remember the damn topic! I got my referral but I'm mad.  TLDR doctor doubts me because im apparently too old, that if I had ADHD I would have been diagnosed earlier  Edit : I forgot to mention that I went through my GP because that was the only way insurance would cover it. Thanks for all your responses. I feel so un-alone

An interesting effect that I did not expect:   I track my happiness everyday (0-10 scale) (among many other metrics), for no particular reason other than I like to have data on things. Before meds I generally ranged between 2 and 8 pretty variably depending on the day and my mood. Generally averaging 5 but with plenty of 2-4 days and 6-8 days.  The last two months on meds: All 5s basically. A few 4s and 6s.   Is this relateable/potentially just coincidence?

I lost it this weekend when i was visiting my boyfriend who lives an hour away. So i can't even look for it.  Hes been looking for it but with no luck.

My moms going to be super mad at me because i now have no form of identification. In order to get a new military id i have to file a police report then go to the military base and get a new one.   I hate being this unorganized. I hate being forgetful. I lose things min 5 times a day. :( this is after taking 50 mg of concerta a day. :(   What do you guys do to make sure you don't lose things?
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;So, how do you write a graduate level research paper without meds?;;;I was diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed adderall 2 years ago, my junior year in university. I picked up my adderall, but only took the pills when I had to do work, and I knew that if I didn't take the pill, I wouldn't get it done.   So here I am now. I stumbled through university and I went abroad to try and complete grad school in Europe. I don't know if I can get my meds here. The laws seem confusing and I don't know where to start...Nevertheless, I find myself facing a deadline to get term papers in.  I have 4, 15 long pages (each), term papers to writes on somewhat related subjects. How does one overcome the symptoms of ADHD to complete these?  I've said I was going to start one of them 3 weeks ago and I keep saying I will tomorrow. I have a month to complete them but, psychologically, my mind is telling me I have plenty of time.   I have never wrote a real paper...Most of my papers were constructed the night before and just mashed together. Usually, I don't have the patience to even proofread my work.   I know I need my medicine, but that is not going to happen. I am stuck with me and my brain and I don't even know how I can break out of this procrastination routine.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;I decided to not tell my 9 year old's teacher that we've started him on meds. Bad idea?;;;We had my 9 year old try adderall early in the school year. He was only on it for about a week and a half into school and we realized it wasn't working well for him. He's inattentive but not hyper, and the med was making him extremely argumentative and angry; he wouldn't do anything he used to enjoy and would refuse to go to the park or Target which he usually begs to do.   We got a rx for Strattera but the first day he took it he just slept the whole day and cried whenever he was forced to get up. So we decided to wait especially since he was scheduled for intensive testing but that's been postponed indefinitely because of insurance.    Anyway, at first I was very open about all of this with his teacher. But every time he had a problem, she would say "he's had such a hard time since stopping the Adderall." I was like, seriously? You saw him on it for 9 days and during that time you put him on a chart and wrote me three emails. Plus he has always done better the first week or two of the school year.   I decided to try again with the Strattera, giving it to him at night instead. So far so good although his behavior hasn't changed much. I decided to not tell his teacher because she seems to have so many biases. If he improves, I want her to notice without knowing. I also resent her resistance to creating any behavioral modification plan or make accommodations. She has him use this stupid chart that does nothing at all and has ignored my requests to meet about a 504 plan or IEP (will talk with her at conferences). Do you see any problem with my decision to not tell her? Should I let the nurse or principal know? Or is it really none of their business? The schools ask for so much information but I don't really fully understand what they need to know to do their job.

I was on medication when I was younger but was taken off rather quickly. I was always an A student, I would just get bored and cause problems.   In college I finally got back on medication when I realized that I could not drink 15+ cups of coffee everyday. I was put on 30mg vyvanse, and for the first time I was able to sit down and plan stuff out. I no longer lost time without knowing where it went. I take it as needed as I usually love my hyper and creative self.   Some years later I am about to graduate and have a job lined up. I recently switched to generic aderall ( cost was too much, and the vyvanse crashes are terrible). I am finding it very hard to finish the most basic of assignments or outside work.    I feel the focus of the medication but I seem to have some motivation issues with getting "easy" work done. I have always been on the impulsive side so motivation was never an issue.  This feels more difficult than before I was medicated. Any advice?
1f00a1062e021a96d727dc989a75c52bc6d51fc6b1f9611414f05066e3d7f9dd;;;I feel like my ADHD is not taken seriously because I am "smart".;;;This turned into a bit of a rant, but I just need to get it out of my system.   I've always been a good student. Straight A student, an over achiever. My ADHD wasn't discovered until I was 17, because teachers and other adults would look past my symptoms since I still managed to ace all my exams.   I fear telling people about my diagnosis because the times I have I have gotten one of the two following responses: "*Really?* But you are so smart" (what they don't realize is that I don't just get good grades, I spend hours upon hours trying to finish simple assignments because I can't concentrate) or "Haha, if *you* have ADHD, imagine what I might have!" (this was said by one of my "random" friends, who seems to think that ADHD= * holds up spork *)   It is so frustrating that people don't take me seriously when I try to talk to them about how I feel. When I say that I didn't get anything done last night because I could not concentrate it does not mean that I tried for 5 minutes and then gave up and watched TV instead, it means that I sat there for HOURS and still only managed to write three scentences. I'm often met with "Oh, why are you complaining, you´re still gonna get an A!" and before exams I've gotten "I wish we could swith brains!" several times.  What they don't realize is that wish that too! I would give anything not to be chronically stressed because I can't get stuff done, to not spend every waking hour completely exhausted only to not be able to fall asleep without laying awake for hours. What for them is a normal conversation is for me a huge effort, I have to keep my focus on what they are saying, I have to stop myself from interrupting them and I have to close out all of the distractions surrounding me. It is exhausting and I just get really sad that they take this gift for granted.   Sorry if it's a bit incoherent but I just needed to get it out of my system because it has been bothering me for quite some time.   EDIT: Wow! I did not expect this post to blow up, I wasn't even expecting anyone to reply! Thank you everyone who has taken their time to answer, I really appreciate it. It's nice to hear that I'm not alone in this. I've also gotten a few helpful tips that I will try. I'll talk to my doct or about my medication, try the library to see if I might study better there and stop telling people about my ADHD (not that it is something I'm waving about, but I don't really keep it a secret either).   Once again thank you to everyone, you have really brightened my week!!

This was written by a psychiatrists who really listened to my story, all my needs, and decided based on past medication history and the way I was describing things, that this dosage would be perfect.  And what do you know, she was right.  I set up a follow up appt for today to gauge how the medicine was going, but due to a scheduling error by the practice, I had to meet with another psychiatrists.  He did not ask me anything about my previous history before the medication, did not bother asking informative questions, and was generally cold and off putting. He simply said "She should not have started you on 40 mg. Standard practice says we start you on 20, so i am going to reduce your dosage"  I immediately went on the defensive, and said that it had been working well, I was doing better in school, could think clearly, etc. He wasn't having it. It took me a good chunk of time to huff and puff until he agreed to write the script for 40. He gave it to me and said thanks, and went back to his computer. If I wasn't on top of these medications and how I was doing, I would've completely missed it.  "Uh, what about my adderall prescription?" "Well it's not a good idea to take two medications at one time" "I don't take them together, I take them apart when the vyvanse wears off to do homework and other things at the end of the day" "Well, I guess that's alright then."  He did not listen to me until I forced him to, and even then was completely rude about it and did not take anything into context.  I asked that I only see my first doc in the future. It really got me upset because I have a lot riding on my medication, as you all know. That he was so ready to just completely diminish it, reasoning that we should "go by 'the book'" got me upset.   Does anyone have any experience with this?

I was diagnosed with ADHD as a child, when I was a bit of a shit-disturber, to say th least. Apparently, my Doctor also thinks I have anxiety, but I'm not worried about it - no pun intended.   In the Spring, my Doctor boosted my dose of my medication, Stratera, as I had grown and needed a larger dose to meet my needs.  Right now I am taking 4 x 18mg of *Mylan-Atomoxetine* (Stratera) and I find that it does next to nothing when it comes to helping me focus.  I keep wanting to go to the gym and work out, but when I have the opportunity, I usually just say "fuck it" and stuff my face. I find that I am socially awkward with my meds, and I didn't use to be before I started taking them.  So my question is: should I consult my doctor to see if a different medication would help me focus more / not procrastinate?  Thanks for sticking through the longer read.

dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;How common is it to receive a misdiagnosis before being diagnosed with ADHD? Looking to hear about others' experiences.;;;**TL;DR: I was given a snapshot diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder and haven't seen any improvements until being diagnosed with ADHD. How common is this experience?**  I've always struggled with mental illness. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was eight but after a single dosage of Adderall, I broke into hives that lasted well over a week. I remember when I took it, it felt like it helped me so much. I noticed a world of difference just from having that one day of focus but because of these side effects, it was determined that maybe I didn't have ADHD after all and would hopefully outgrow it.  I continued to see therapists off and on throughout my childhood to cope with the insanely intense separation anxiety that was triggered from my mother's unstable presence in my life. My diagnosis changed more times than I was able to keep track of!  When I was twelve, I was diagnosed with Bipolar II and was put on numerous medications to control these symptoms. These medications made me extremely sick and after nearly two years, my father decided to take me off of them very abruptly. I was even sicker for a few weeks but noticed great improvement and a leveling out after being off the medications.  I didn't attempt to seek treatment for clinical depression until I suffered a nervous breakdown at the age of nineteen. At that point I tried several different SSRI's, all of which I had unusually bad side effects with. Each one made me severely depressed. I discontinued any usage of medications after a suicide attempt but have remained in therapy pretty consistently since then. The depression ended up being purely situational, retroactive as a result of a traumatic childhood. My depression has cleared up over time and only flares up between September-November. It is retroactive depression caused by a traumatic event that occurred August 29th, 2010 and created a string of very damaging events well into November that same year. I have maintained a diagnosis of C-PTSD as a result of this in combination with the traumatizing events from my childhood.  Last October, at the age of twenty, I was misdiagnosed with mild Borderline Personality Disorder. My diagnosis was later changed to Borderline traits. Four months later, my therapist at the time determined that I no longer met the diagnostic criteria for BPD or Borderline traits.  This June, I began seeing a new therapist who believes that this diagnosis was completely inaccurate and that my previous therapist was simply projecting her own issues onto her patients. I agree; after less than five minutes of my initial meeting with this therapist, she determined I was borderline and spent every appointment thereafter basically giving me a pre-prepared lecture on what BPD is and how to cope with various issues that borderline people face without ever giving me much of a chance to actually talk about the issues that were personally affecting me.  None of what she was talking about felt like it really applied to the issues I was struggling with. She would often disregard a lot of what I said and would relate everything she was saying back to herself (a hallmark trait of BPD!) and her own struggles with the disorder. (That seems really unprofessional to me for a mental health professional to talk about their personal life as consistently as she did but okay.) I didn't notice any improvement in my behaviors, impulse control, mood fluctuations or how to control my moods, anxiety, and ruminations until my ADHD diagnosis.  Since I've been diagnosed and have taken the time to educate myself about this disorder and have taken the steps to learn what works best for managing this, it feels like I have seen the light at the end of a dark tunnel that felt like it had no end in sight!  I now feel that I have a much better grasp of where my aggression stems from, why I'll get stuck in a bad mood or obsess over something inconsequential. I do still struggle with some of the same things as Borderline people do, such as appropriate levels of attachment and severe anxiety surrounding abandonment, obsessive thoughts, mild impulsiveness and a fluctuation in moods but my moods don't feel severe enough to be Borderline. I still struggle with relationships, both platonic and romantic but in all other aspects of my life I feel pretty level.  Who else on here experienced a misdiagnosis before receiving treatment for ADHD? If so, what have your experiences been?

I have been taking Adderall XR for some time now and I feel like it would be helping out a lot if I didn't have so much stress and anxiety flowing through my mind daily. The Adderall makes the anxiety a bit worse but I feel like it's the only way I can accomplish assignments at a somewhat normal to slower than average pace. I have heard that there are alternatives to Adderall that may work better with my system but I don't want to give up the little focus I am gaining from my current script.   My main question comes down to this:  * Do you guys have any suggestions or have been through a similar situation where switching meds made a world of difference?   I am looking for any advice really. I just feel like my symptoms are not as serious as some suffer from, so I am hesitant to change what I have going now.

It really helps with to study and chills me out in general—That is while the effects of the drug last.  Currently taking a 20mg dose, and it last for about 4 hours. When the Vyvanse wears off, I feel brain-dead, tired and anxious. (worse than if i take no meds at all). I talked to my Doc about this issue, and he told me to take another 20mg when the 1st dose wears off. This does help me, but now my sleep schedule is terrible. I'm up all night and sleep through my morning class. (even if I don't take the 2nd dose). I've done some research and see this is a common issue, amongst Vyvanse users.   How do you all get over this "crash" without taking more meds? Also, is their anything that can be done to make the initial dosage last longer? (the less drug intake—the better). Finally, does anyone have a hard time shutting off your brains internal dialogue when on the drug? (Guessing it's anxiety?... For example, if I'm studying in the library and a cute girl sits across from me and checks me out, my brain wont stop analyzing LOL. I have a girlfriend too, so the thoughts are quite unpleasant! Usually happens when I'm coming down from the Vyvanse, or else I would be too focused on my studied to even worry about anyone!)  Thank you all,  -Blame it on the ADHD

The insane part is I was terribly upset when I saw how old the posts were in the ADD subreddit. I'm so happy this one is so active. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was four years old. I'm 25 now and the past 21 years I have been medicated. Since I was 12 I've taken the same dosage which is 30mg XR but since it's so expensive I just take the 30mg IR twice a day. Last Friday I finally got an actual doctor diagnosis of having depression. I've always seemed to have it and I never really knew why. The tasks at hand with ADHD even medicated is sometimes so overwhelming. It really gets me down and most of the time I find myself sitting in the middle of the floor wondering how in the hell I got there. This isn't any specific question just really me for the first time ever proudly introducing myself as someone with ADHD. The only reason this is a proud event is because all of you know what I go through and you understand that I'm not stupid (like uneducated ADHD haters) I just have a hard time with focusing.  Anyways if you can't tell already all of this is completely scrabbled together but the meds are done for the day.  Anyways nice to meet everyone. Hopefully I can get to know a lot of you and share stories and experiences

How do I come will waiting on a Dx?;;;So as I've gotten into upper division course work, it's become increasingly apparent I have some ADHD symptoms that are really truly interfering with my life. I'll forget where I put my glasses and keys every day without fail. I will find a way to distract myself even if my phone is off and everything I'd think is a distraction is put away. Simple things like cleaning and cooking are downright hard--not because I'm depressed, not because I'm lazy, it's just so much work (and even breaking it down into steps it's still hard to finish).  But I reached my breaking point tonight when I realized I couldn't finish a paper. I realized that my writing process is NOT normal compared to neurotypicals. It takes *so* long because I can only focus for 200 words or so. Returning to a paper after I take a break, it takes me a long time to refocus. It feels like a personal failure and I'm humiliated.  I don't like to self-diagnose, and I'm not here for a diagnosis--just advice. I am on the 5-6 month long waiting list for ADHD testing and am looking into doctor's who might take my therapist's referral. I've tried as hard as I can but my brain will still go "nah man, you're done, do something else, do anything else, hell study for another class." This is something that in retrospect I can see has been a problem for years, but my increased workload is making these symptoms more apparent.  TL; DR: English major having problems with focus, distractability, motivation. How did posters here cope between realizing you have a problem and receiving a diagnosis, proper meds, etc?

TL;DR steps to take before i move to a new doc for ADHD ?

I shake my legs, zone out, Have a really hard time finishing school work(I have 3 essays right now and they are weeks due) when I'm told to do something I take my time even if its picking up a piece of paper,Blurt out random unneeded things, the symptoms of ADHD. I want to check out with a doctor, but my mom says I'm just born dumb and that if I do take meds I will be fucked up in the brain. she believes in her "facts" because she knows other people that act weird from taking meds. After reading that article on facts of ADHD I think its time to try to get it checkout. But I have no proof that it's okay to take meds and I don't think an article on a website with an alien monkey will convince her at all.  (TL;DR)I jump to the conclusion that I might have ADHD. mom thinks its going to make me fucked up in the brain if i take meds  please don't yell at me for errors I need to finish my essays and I just only did a quick skim
93483336bcd3f9f2625877e10bec8dc838ebfe6243fa47e58500fef08b9759c0;;;got a diagnosis, first pill todat;;;hello all, i got my diagnosis confirmed by a psychiatrist, was put on concerta xl, taken my first 18mg just now, a bit apprehensive. all in all the first visit was great, can't fault the service from the nhs at liverpool, hope others get the same luck.  three hours in and i can see the effect, i can read pages of stuff that i wouldn't normally read, weird... am i expected to see even better results as i take it over the next few days and as i up the dose over the next few weeks?
7fdd1fc2bd1b93249cbbf0ed41d6cab16f0a83061d318805a296dc02d791a536;;;Writing letters and words out of order / missing letters in words;;;So I have ADHD, but I am not sure if this habit it indicative of something else... I don't want to throw around any possible diagnostic ideas of what it might be, but does anyone else deal with this?  &amp;nbsp;  For as long as I can remember, I often make the mistake of writing the second letter of a word before linearly writing the entire word first.   &amp;nbsp;  - For example, as I was studying for an exam today, I *needed* to write "ICVS" for Int'l Crime Victim Survey. Instead of writing I-C-V-S, I wrote C (then put the "I" before the C) and V-S.  - When intending to write the word "Academics" and I forgot the last "C" and had to fit it in after originally writing "Academis."  - When intending to write the word "reduced," I wrote "R-D..." Then stopped and had to change the "D" into looking like an "E."   &amp;nbsp;  Typing tends to be less of a problem, but handwriting is painstakingly irritating and frustrating. I am regarded as "bright" and "smart," so these mistakes aren't a product of grammatical errors / lack of knowledge.  &amp;nbsp;  I am currently on Concerta as of a month and I think I am just more aware of this habit because I am able to focus for a long duration of time and notice more details and errors I used to bypass.
2a8c0e74ad235cf8b876c376eae0b926d7a0b54d4e52286d7d1617cfefb77541;;;Ritalin names and prices in different countries.;;;I'm from Luxembourg and we use the Belgium product called Rilatine by the company Novartis. I received a new prescription with:    * Rilatine 10 mg (short-acting) * Rilatine MR 30  (intermediate-acting)  Sadly people with ADHD not diagnosed as a child don't get any refund for the medication. Moreover we don't have any generic drugs, so I wanted to see what the prices were in the surrounding countries.     I was a bit confused about the name of the second one "Rilatine MR 30". He said it should last for 8 hours, so intermediate-acting. So is this equivalent to "Ritalin SR"?     Do you have any information of names/prices in Germany, Belgium or France? When I called a pharmacy in Germany, they said they only had "Ritalin LA" and the normal one.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;I've been off my medication now for just about 1 year and here's what I've noticed.;;;The medication I was on was Vyvanse. The initial time I was on it I took 30mg a day, and worked my way up to 60mg. 30mg was useful only really during the 2-3 hours around the peak. We jumped to 50 and it was still only actually useful for a total of 5-6 hours rather than the 8-10 I needed, then jumped to 70 and it made the side effects too intense, so we settled on 60 and it seemed to be the perfect amount. (Keep in mind I'm a big dude; 6'2" 220 pounds).   Sometime mid-november of last year I was taken off my meds cold-turkey. I had been on it for almost 2 years when I was taken off. For the 2ish months leading to me being taken off it, there was occasional abuse of it. During the last 2 months was when I was on it, I got depressed. I used to smoke weed at the end of every day to deal with the comedown, then decided to quit smoking. (after re reading this part id like to clarify that what I mean is 2 months before I was taken off the meds i stopped smoking weed, so I abused the meds to sort of cope).   So during the two months I sometimes rationalized saving meds a few days and doubling or even tripling my dose. It was great but the comedown was never fun. I decided I didn't want to be on the medication anymore because I was depressed. I initially figured the depression came from the lack of weed, but in reality it came from the abuse.   When I was on the medication, I was also on a low dose of Effexor, I believe 75mg. My psychiatrist told me the Effexor leveled me out, and supposedly was required to regulate serotonin. Cold turkey off of that wasn't fun.   The first month without medication was hell. I was so motivated and alert and focused before, now I was lazy tired and my brain was like a large series of tracks with little carts carrying information, unable to properly distinguish more important concepts from others leading to confusion and constant derailing of the carts. All of these feelings were similar to before i was put on medication, only the withdrawal from both meds didn't help a single bit. I smoked a lot more cigarettes per day during this period, it had escalated to almost a pack a day. (I've now been clean of all *tobacco* products for nearly 7 months and have switched 100% to vaping. I've tapered from 24mg juice to 3mg!)  After 3 months total off the meds, the withdrawal was completely over. I was "normal" again. Just like before the medication.   It's been a struggle becoming functional again. I was already dysfunctional enough before the medication, but after my short spout of abuse and cold turkey withdrawal, it got worse.   Now that it's been a year, here's what I've noticed that's positive.   I do have a slightly better time remembering stuff. I started smoking weed again and my memory is still better than before the medication. I also have a bit more drive to succeed in life and don't give up as easily as before.   Here's what I've noticed that's negative.   I have insane difficulties making and keeping eye contact with people. I didn't have this problem before being put on medication, so I really can't say for sure what caused that.  I also get really anxious in conversation because my brain tries to start the beginning of a sentence and simultaneously tries to figure out the end and middle of a sentence at the same time. I fidget a lot and I worry a lot about where to keep my eyes, but they want to see and take in everything at once. My brain just constantly feels overwhelmed and overstimulated. This is how it was before starting the medication, and I don't know if it's gotten better or worse.  I also space out a lot, just like before, but my space-outs usually last longer than before. I'll be trying to focus on a conversation or someone talking to me, then ponder a detail of what they said and completely stop listening to the rest of what they're saying. I consciously try to stop this from happening but it's very difficult. It doesn't happen with every conversation, especially conversations extremely important to me, but when it does it sucks.  I've had a hard time maintaining a good sleep schedule the past year, but recently I've gotten better.    So in short, I'm mostly like how I was before medication. I've improved in some areas but gotten worse in others.   And I know a lot of the things I did were wrong. I had some problems, and for a long time I denied it. I know abusing medication is very bad, I know relying on weed every day is bad, and I understand I screwed up. I'm not posting this for attention or to have a sob story, I just truly want to put my anecdotal experience up for you guys to see and compare to other experiences you've had or read of. I put a lot of time into this post so I hope you guys at least enjoyed it or got something from it. If you have any questions or need anything in the post clarified don't be afraid to PM me or post a comment.   Cheers

6178fd41d09132aa1130f6ea7e6ae6aa79c41b03cc73bf629ca2e4704303104f;;;I can't focus at work, I'm on the verge of insanity.;;;First posted this on r/offmychest in hopes someone would give me some advice, nobody answered. Good thing I found this subreddit, I'm mostly gonna vent here though, so here I go!   When I was a kid I was diagnosed with "attention problems" but my parents refused to give me any medicine because they thought it was gonna go away eventually. Oh boy they were wrong.   Throughout all highschool I struggled so much to focus in class, 10 minutes was my limit, after that I would begin fidgeting, reading other chapters of my textbook, looking outside and being distacted by crows and so on. I ended up repeating my last year before university 3 times due to me not being able to focus at all. I somehow made it.   Now I'm nearing my second year of university, currently in an internship, and it is hell on earth atm. I just can't focus, it's a thousand times worse than some years ago. When I try working I have this feeling of my eyes losing focus and the front of my head feeling heavy, it is almost crippling. Once I had decided that I had enough of feeling like this, I start browsing stuff online and fidgeting like crazy. I can't keep my fingers in place (constant finger drumming on my leg).   I'm worried about my future, I already struggle learning anything during / outside of class, everything is either painful or just plain distracting.   I'm scared of getting treatment though, I don't know what to expect, people in France actually look down on people who have this, in general you see documentaries shitting on medication saying that "hyperactive kids just have a ton of energy, this shit is a scam!". I don't want to be told that I'm insane or anything.  I honestly dunno what else to say, I lost my train of thought and forgot how I was gonna end this. Whatever.   EDIT: Did some horrendous grammar / spelling mistakes in there, I think some are still around, gotta proofread stuff more :V   EDIT2: I noticed I wrote two different sentences that basically said the same thing.  EDIT3: I appreciate the answers guys, I am feeling a lot better and I understand much better what is going on with me, I have an appointment on friday and hopefully I'll get to sort things out :D!  Cheers! :)

Thoughts and opinions highly appreciated.;;;On ADHD  I don't know what induced me to start looking up all these stories about adhd. I've known many people diagnosed with it but always believed it wasn't a real phenomenon. I thought to myself, "Everyone is like that though. Hell, I'M like that." But my grades are great. It can't be. Yet school has always been difficult. Getting these good grades isn't what I'd call "simple." I put a TON of effort into getting them. My friends often mention how I always seem to "put so much more effort" into my work than them. How I am the "perfect student" because I study so often. But am I really? I feel I have to work twice as hard than anyone else to simply "remember" things I learn in class. I have to start my projects and homework assignments weeks in advance because I feel like I may actually take THAT long.   But here I am, senior at my university. Still as anxious over this work as ever. I go back on my antidepressants because I have a panic attack. (I was diagnosed with anxiety &amp; depression my 2nd year here.) No depression this time around so I can't blame my lack of motivation on that. Must be senioritis, I think to myself. But goddamn, why is it so hard to do anything? I can't even do things I supposedly enjoy like watching shows; I tend to end up taking out my 3DS and play it at the same time. Maybe it's because I'm bored, I think. So many unfinished things tasks. But then I find myself remembering back to the 3rd grade. I remember spacing out often. Failing tests. I almost got held back that year because my teacher claimed I couldn't spell basic words. Mother argued I was a bad test-taker. I still am. I do horribly on long tests? But why? I can't focus long enough. Possibility of adhd? Or am I blowing this all out of porportion?
add361083a27b42eb9746c12c542e95a764affe895aff9e00d0b06f845c5c6f5;;;Any tips on being absolutely useless when it comes to being social?;;;I'm sorry for the extremely long post. I know I'm on /r/ADHD. I guess if i was to make a TL;DR, it would be: how can i overcome social anxiety while being the introvert that I am?  First off, I'm 21, diagnosed and medicated for about a year and a half now. I wasn't too social in high school and haven't been social in college. I believe I'm an introvert because I'm usually held back unless I'm with a small group of really good friends. I'm much more comfortable with even being on my own as opposed to going out and going to parties or any kind of gathering or event.   But I've been thinking it might be more of anxiety than being an introvert, unless those are known to go together. My entire family, grandparents, aunts, uncles, parents, you name it, is known to have issues with anxiety. So I take my social problems as maybe an effect of my anxiety? I just think about having to go out and be in an unfamiliar place with potentially unfamiliar people. And when I'm trying to talk to someone, maybe my anxiety takes over there too?  Yes I've been medicated for anxiety and it helps on the overall problem, but I still feel like no matter what, I have no social skills.  But it's not like I'm not used to being in a social environment. I've played sports all my life. Soccer since I could walk, and football throughout middle and high school and I'm more than willing to play any kind of sport thrown at me. Same goes to video games and such. It seems as if there's any competition involved, I'm much more willing to be involved.   Lastly, I feel like whenever I'm trying to get my thoughts into words, never are they able to express what I want them to, and frequently I'm starting comments or posts here and just scrap it because I feel almost embarrassed about it. Same with talking in person. I feel as if I can never get to a point and what I say just leaves everything hanging.

My niece has severe ADHD, she had a teacher who was letting her do her tests orally, but since she's changed teachers her grades have dropped by 30% because her new teacher doesn't. I'm sure this is a documented ADHD issue and can be included in her IEP if we can find some evidence to back it up!
956f7b1ebf03f2d7096fd838211024e13795005cd599af67bdd67698a7bbba1d;;;Can ADHD affect your social skills and make it seem like you're autistic? Similar experiences?;;;I'm ADHD-PI, and always fit in the shy category growing up. I don't think I was I was really shy, I mean I was quiet but that's because most of the time I was uncontrollably zoning out and getting distracted by other things, which made it hard to notice some body language and social cues, like when I was boring the other  person to death in conversations. I also always had trouble of thinking of stuff to say in conversations (basically my mind couldn't keep up with conversations, so I was very passive), fumbled words a ton, and when I had such trouble focusing it was hard to come across as interested or expressive. I also used to constantly struggle to remember people's names which got me bullied. I was also home-schooled for a good portion of my time in middle school, which deprived me of a lot of different social environments, because my parents saw my academic struggles and inability to keep up, not as ADHD or even my fault (I wasn't diagnosed until I was 20 years old), and how I was constantly bullied.        After this, I really lagged behind socially and really fit into the socially awkward category. I also developed social anxiety because of being awkward and how mainly when people spoke to me I was accused of being lazy and unmotivated and made fun of, so I often felt like people would only talk to me because I did something wrong. Once I was diagnosed with ADHD and put on vyvanse, I really was able to improve my social skills and get them up to par, notice other people's body language and expressions way more easily, and carry on conversations that aren't one-sided. I also realized that I did understand a lot of stuff about body language and could get a good read of people just as long as I could focus on it and be confident about myself, though I still had some learning and catching up to do.  Some people used to think I was autistic (one ER doctor even tried to label me as that in the 10 minutes he saw me) because I was socially awkward and smart though I don't think I am though I still worry about it at times. Can ADHD affect your social skills and make it seem like you're autistic? What are your thoughts on this? Is there any link between ADHD and social awkwardness? Similar experiences?
0daeebf9ab6534167c44a7dfb56712103501b56270ac54dba078640e1dab464c;;;Adult ADHD - untreated. My experience.;;;Nobody realizes that some people expend tremendous energy merely to be normal -- Albert Camus  Hello everyone,  Read that quote for the first time this morning. It explains my life.  I'm 39 years old. Lets take stock here - assuming I'm at the halfway point (expectancy of... 80 maybe?), it took me half my life to figure out WTF is wrong with me.  About three weeks ago, mid sentence - a friend (who I later learned has ADHD) asked me - "Do you have ADHD??" I stopped. I considered it... hmmm... When I was 15, I was diagnosed, but ignored it. This was 1990 - WTH was this quack science? Here's how I fared since then.   At 16 I dropped out of HS. Never attended college.  19 - 21 arrested countless times for petty crimes.  24  - faced 10 years federal time. Managed to plea avoiding jail.  Then I married, found a good job, had children.   Did that for 10 years. Normal.   2011, I guess it came out of remission or something. Couldnt focus on the job anymore. They were throwing MORE money my way, but I ran - I couldnt perform (I felt i was slipping...). Fearful of failing. Justified it as "Wasn't challenged" anymore.   Went onto a job that pays well, but where i DO NOTHING all day. Drove me mad.  Got divorced, alienated my Ex (we combated at every turn).   This year, lost over 100k gambling. Action.  Live in a 1 bedroom apt with 7 (yes 7) guys cause its all I can afford. And I make six figures.  Lets see. Somethings not right there. I explored ADHD. Heres my insight to my behaviors:  -- Genius qualities, with absolutely no follow through. My mind usually shuts down upon diving in (*If its not exciting, which work usually isnt), always fail to maximize potential.   -- Give me something surface level - instant on the spot - I've mastered the art of solving it immediately, effectively, precisely.  -- LT Goals get destroyed by my lack of attention to them. Mauls my self esteem. Doesn't set well for 'my future'. Sheesh, I don't even try anymore. Although I have one (save for later...)  -- I am gripped by restlessness most of the time. Always knew it was there, but not sure what it was. Action, excitement, stimulation - Trouble - driving fast, acting reckless, loud music, drinking to calm it down, etc... these all quelled the monster.  -- Rarely if ever make eye contact with people, although I'm very self confident.   -- I have children. I was always at odds with my ex over raising them - she believes I don't care about them, but I do. I have a good relationship with them btw, but I was not very nurturing. You see, I'm over here trying to keep my plates spinning, how can I focus on them? Add in an uncontrollable restlessness, the patience required for being a dad was difficult.   -- Work. Was successful for years. Job was very 'reactionary'. Solved problems. Was an ace at it, excelled. When it came to proactive - I sucked. I would work long hours - get praised for that - But I'm doing that just to get 5 minutes worth of work in. Amazing in hindsight how I didn't see that, the late nights.  -- Sleep deprivation helps BIG time. Always perform better when sick, tired wondered why. Its because It got this monster off my back for a day or two. Hungover is great as well. I love hangovers.  -- Gambling, crime, fighting with anyone I have relationships with - I'm seeking action. Without knowing it. Just need something to pop my mind off. Anything.   Rule out depression. As effed up as life is now, I'm not depressed. I've learned to live with this thing, and because of it, I've learned to embrace high and low points of life - its just something that wraps me.  So what now? I look forward to treatment. I need medication. I called 10 therapists, no return calls. I'm very skeptical about psychiatrists - I've found most to be quacks. I know there are good ones, I need a good one to help me tackle this.  I'm looking forward to medication. At this point, this is physical - and its running my life.If I get a few quacks in a row, I'm going to online meds.   I have hope for my future. I have an idea / plan for a business. I've never felt this way about a concept. I do focus on it - I do have brain techniques to keep work going on it - but damn its exhausting and it would be nice to have flow. I never had flow :(  This revelation is a break through. It could really help me.

A few months ago, I was diagnosed with ADD @ 23 y/o [went in suspecting depression and anxiety after many, many years of feeling it; turns out untreated ADD causes a whole suite of issues]  2. Stumbling across coffee, I fell in love with it and began drinking regularly 5+ years ago. It became a culinary sort of pursuit for me, spending lots of time experimenting with brew methods and delving into home roasting!  3. Doctor put me on Ritalin IR, which has helped immensely, but I really miss my coffee. For the time being I have temporarily resorted to roasting my own decaf coffee - but I would love to be able to add back traditional, 'unmolested' coffee - as there's a lot more variety out there.  [note: don't know if it's a placebo effect, but after being off caffeinated coffee for months and having a standard cup, I realize I'm way more anxious and prone to negative thoughts. I don't know if it's a timing thing with the coffee too, or perhaps the amount I'm having (330ml)]  TL;DR - A serious coffee enthusiast that recently got diagnosed with Adult ADD, now on Ritalin. Doctor says Ritalin doesn't play well with coffee (it seems to cancel effects) - what options do I have? Want to heal my ADD, but finding it hard to give up on the traditional coffees (temporarily on decaf).

I can't believe how obvious it all was.;;;Anyone else feel that the massive, glaring "YOU HAVE ADD MOTHERFUCKER" signs are just so painfully obvious in hindsight? It would have saved me a hell of a lot of trouble if someone had noticed early enough. This probably has a lot to do with what we know about teenage girls being more susceptible to ADHD-PI, which can be hidden for a long time.   Here are some excerpts from age 16-17 (I was finally diagnosed at age 23 when I was at risk of dropping out of university):  3/24/2004  I really don't want to write my math test. Today I felt like I'd rather hand it in blank and not have to write it than try to concentrate on it and pass. I felt like that a lot last semester, and in grade 10. And I swore I wouldn't do it again. Shit. And I don't want to write the script. I want to go to bed, lie awake for a few hours cursing myself for not doing a million things, then fall into a nightmare-filled sleep like I do every night. I mean, why break tradition? I'm so used to not doing my work I've honed my excuses to a perfection never attained by a student before.  5/2/2004  I wonder what things would be like if I had motivation. I could get so much fucking stuff done.   5/13/2004  Why is it that I'd rather sit and stare at the ceiling for hours on end than get up and fucking do something? Why do I stare at my test papers, thinking about what my middle school art teacher told me about graphite and pressure on paper, instead of just fucking concentration on something quasi-important and fucking doing it? It's not that fucking hard. So why is it? Fuck. Why do I overanalyze things like this? What does it accomplish? I always just end up more confused than I began.  7/7/2004  What the fuck am I doing?! I sit around thinking, thinking, thinking and not doing....

Talking is hard for me too. I'm genuinely confident and I fucking know it, but what comes out of me is the exact opposite. I have so many acquantances, but little friends. I'm happy for a few days with people, but then I get dry as hell. I can't form sentences correctly, start zoning out, and I get dumb in the head. What's really hurting me the most is that I am fucking confident, but I can't even handle a conversation. I'm so random, the only way I get to know a person on a deeper level is by doing something fun together. Sit down and chat? No that's not for me. When we do something fun together, I'm like the funnest person to be around. In gym class, people are attracted to me because I hyperfocus on the exercise, lose track of time, I just feel like a baby again. It makes me so mad that I keep waking and sleeping without getting that girl I love. I was sitting next to a girl on the train, and we were touching legs lightly and jesus I went to heaven. All my fears, anxieties, worries, stresses melted on the spot. It's so warm having a girl touch me lol, but sadly I can't get any. Ohhh the desperation. I just want a girl to touch me (non or explicitly) but the only way I can't get one is through talking and I suck at conversation. I'm so body language confident and it hurts me so much being this confident and not being able to conquer :(. I don't know why USA &amp;amp; Europe girls gotta be so hard.We were meant to get together.   TL;DR: I can't get a whale and it hurts so, so badly.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;I was just told I was addicted to "Speed" by my own father;;;Well guys, this is my first post on this subreddit, but i have been lurking for about 3 months and have read many of the stories of how a lot of you guys have benefited from ADHD medication. I have been prescribed 10mg and 20mg of adderol since I was in kindergarden, but I didn't start taking them until 8th grade. I am one of those kids that you can tell, just by the way they act, that they have ADHD. I've had problems with grades and focusing through out my entire life, and adderol has been the only thing that has really helped me. My father, who also has ADHD, has never had to take any medication in his life. He believes that because I take 10mg and am still hyper that the adderol is pretty much speed. I have never felt worse in my life, having my own dad say I take speed. So, to prove that I am not a druggie and that he is wrong I am no longer taking my adderol. I know my grades will tank, but hopefully I will still be able to keep them somewhat high. Any of you guys deal with people like this often? I would love to hear some of you guys talk about what it was like to go off of the ADHD meds.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;How should I talk to my parent about me disliking my therapist?;;;I was diagnosed about 6 months ago. For the first two months after, I went to go see a psychologist weekly. I really liked him, but the clinic he worked in stopped accepting my parent's health insurance, so we switched. I really don't like my new therapist. Whenever I talk to her, I feel like she's uneducated about her profession. I've found that I can't ask any questions about the medication she recommended for me because doesn't know anything about it. The advice she gives me is so unrealistic, that even my dad has started mentioning it.  I really don't want to go see her anymore, but I feel bad because it's the only other place my parents could find that works with the insurance plan we're on... What should I do? Should I just stick it through? Does therapy even really help with ADHD? I haven't been in it with a good therapist long enough to know at this point...

I alway work out how much i was able to going to get for the paper. I worked out all the awnsers that i am 100% certain and the awnsers that i am not sure of and i avoid countimg the marks that i geused. I estimated me getting about 90-96 %. I am usually quite spot on with my estimates. Today i got too school and i found out my best freind got a 100% for his paper. I was glad for him tilli foundout that the math teacher also tutor about 3 children in the klass and in the lesson beforaney exam she goes through the actual papper with them and give them all the awnsers. I got so mad when i heard that my friends girlfreind went and told him what he must studys and everything, thats why he got a 100% for the paper. I know i am complaining over nothing but i got congratulated for my 80% (witch for me is a sh*t mark) i got soo mad...

All my friends and cousins **younger than me** are posting their **4-Year** college graduation pictures and here I can't even complete a **2 year** degree that I have been working on since I graduated High School in 2009. I am now 23 years old, and I do not even feel like going back to my hometown for Christmas because I know everyone will ask me why I haven't graduated yet. I feel worthless.  I discovered this subreddit around September 2014 and reading everyone's stories made me go visit a doctor. I was immediately diagnosed with ADHD and was put on Stratterra (which I feel is useless). However it is now too late. I have been put on Academic Suspension for excessive failed/withdrawn classes for the next semester so now I'm stuck here being worthless for another semester. I do not know if I can even go to the Disabilities Center on Campus to see if I can appeal this. This suspension will fuck me over because  I only need 12 more credits to graduate...  What do I do? I'm here in a city 400 miles away from my family  by myself and I feel alone because I feel like everybody is judging me.
aefd17aced07a9b69d17268df03b7a29f47bcba83bffc2297cc8f377d5ee0742;;;How can someone with ADHD be better in a relationship?;;;I've been diagnosed with ADHD since I was 11 or 12 and I've gotten so used to it that I've never really considered it to be a problem for anything outside of school/work/cleaning.  I've been in a serious long distance relationship for about 3.5+ years and the ADHD is becoming a problem. Or it's been one and it just occurred to us that it's to blame.   We lived together 6mo last year and are living together now. We're engaged.  I always assumed my out of sight out of mind way of existing was a personality trait, but apparently it's part of it. It's making him really unhappy as my summer job made me communicate less and it really hurt him that I went. (Long story, TLDR I was selfish and took a job that would make me happy but also depress the crap out of him.) He's starting to hate me.  **How can I work on my ADHD to pay more attention to him? I need suggestions.**  * I clean the house obsessively and yet I can't seem to keep my stuff where it belongs.   * I listen to podcasts and do the dishes and clean the living room while my meds kick in but then it's back to a mess after breakfast. **How can I integrate that cleaning more regularly into my day?**  * I need tv background noise that's familiar at times, and he feels like he can never watch anything he wants. I half watch most things, and he's fully immersing in stuff so it's hard for him to rewatch. * I'm an Etsy seller so my schedule is way more up in the air than his 9-5, and I've been overwhelmed with holiday orders lately and so I haven't had time with him as much and so I keep trying to get stuff done while still being with him and he feels like he can't do anything. * I know what works for me in terms of getting stuff done, and unfortunately it's making him feel like he has to constantly adapt to me.   He's trying to work around my problems, and I love him stupid amounts- he's not in the wrong for being so upset about these things.  But I want to make it less of a struggle.   **TL;DR: How can I work on making my ADHD messiness/inattentiveness less of a problem in the relationship?**

They tried me out on ritalin(horrible reaction), concerta(just as bad), but the one that worked the best was adderall. The thing is, when I was on it, I felt uncomfortable all the time. I went from weighing 130 pounds to 115 pounds within a few weeks. I'm not in college now, I have a job in sales. but I feel getting back the meds will help my job performance. is it worth it?
4eda4222d26bbe3a0b8504e53e327811732b83b9afad75510066f20c29c5ac66;;;Thinking of tutoring other people who have ADHD;;;TLDR: ADHDer (with a law degree) asking if ppl would seek out a tutor that understands adhd, first hand.   I've been thinking about tutoring Junior High level and above, and was wondering if anyone thought focusing on people with ADHD is something parents/college students would look for.   My background - Had adhd all my life, but wasn't diagnosed until halfway through law school. I graduated and am studying for the Bar exam, but want to pick up some extra cash. Coming to my diagnosis has changed my outlook in my own life, and I can't help but look back at how much I struggled through school thinking I was lazy and constantly frustrated with my own performance. I knew I was smart - at least smart enough - so I pushed everything to the last minute (finishing High School essays the class period before they were due). I would ace tests/last minute essays, but my grades would tank because I would never do my homework. The only thing that saved my getting into college were my standardized test scores. The reason, I now know, is because I was able to hyperfocus on those tests. I scored in the top 10% on both my SAT and the LSAT.  Long story short, I think that if I had an earlier diagnosis, and if I had a tutor that understood my feelings/learning style and worked with me, my journey would have been a lot easier. So, would you look for a tutor that has ADHD?   This isn't meant to be a solicitation (although if you're in Los Angeles and need a tutor, PM me :), it's a genuine question because I've been thinking about how needlessly frustrating school was for me growing up. I'd just really like to help a kid/young college student who has adhd succeed...and law school was expensive.  I just wanted to hear if my adhd sub thought this could be a good idea. Thanks!
91fbd85d33aea99dba6279d6720d6c4e3664fde6d3c1017e7ede0a85634b03de;;;Here's how I see ADHD;;;Lets talk about music players.  Your average person(in this scenario) has a media player with a long list. So if they want to listen to a song, they have to scroll over to it. They might see some songs they'd like to listen to, but they don't click on them. They might listen to a couple songs on the way, but as they keep scrolling, they'll usually make it to the song they wanted to hear.  Now, someone with adhd. We don't get a list function. We have our library on permanent shuffle, and forward/back controls. Except sometimes the back function doesn't work. Less commonly, the forward function won't work. Very rarely, a search bar will appear and be functional, but only for a short time. Also, if a song is longer than a minute, it might accidentally skip to the next song after a bit.   Back to the average person. They don't see our media player. So they look at us, and ask us why we don't just scroll to the song we want to listen to. To them, we're just getting stuck on too many songs we want to listen to. In reality, though, we're just trying our best to listen to the songs we want to, but it's harder than they realize.  Patches will never give us a list function. It's just not in our media player's code. But patches can improve the frequency and uptime for the search bar, can make the forward/back function much more reliable, and lower the frequency of accidental skips forward.  Does this analogy make any sense? I'm not great at them... like a shark.

Makes me a little unbalanced emotionally.  I have another sample bottle for one more week, thats my last sample then its up to me if i want to use my prescription.  Really not sure what to do, if i dont feel anything within the next week i dont know because it can take a month to work. but what if it really doesn't work for me?
a5c74d5a1b73fa83fef53225bc4d9aa1f3ce7b28646b79559cbd18f25a527400;;;My good news;;;I tend to ramble so this will be brief. Since I was diagnosed in April 2014, I have had 2 promotions and 2 raises. Not that it means anything outside my company, but I started my job April 2012 at 10.50 US an hour, moved to the billing department in April 2013 and went up to 11.50 and stayed here until my next yearly raise in April to 12.50. Since I was diagnosed in April 2014, I have had 2 promotions and 2 raises and now make 15.50 an hour. I work on my own, no metrics or quota really, I just have to stay ahead of the numbers, thats it. Without my diagnosis and treatment, Id still be exactly where I was before I got help.  I'm really happy about it and wanted to share it with you guys. Thanks for reading. :)

34eb874f75224e8bcd99a7e2e5314a9b0ea7f7140d184989bc1b5283bf2e5370;;;An update - it wasn't ADHD;;;I joined on this subreddit over a year ago when my GP dx'ed me with adult ADHD and put me on Ritalin. Which did help. But I am nearly 50 and it just seems weird to suddenly get diagnosed, after all these years.   The update for you all -- my dermatologist recently ran some tests and turns out I have a B12 deficiency. Apparently, I'd been subclinical (i.e., borderline low but not low enough to set off red flags) for YEARS. When my GP last tested my B12, just a few months before he recommended the Ritalin, I was at 289. This was after several months of massive vitamin supplementation, per my own self treatment -- because I was suffering so much with cognitive deficits and all that.   I went on the Ritalin, it did work for awhile, but I developed other issues including shortness of breath, palpitations, tingling sensations (peripheral neuropathy), facial flushing and I forget everything else. Anyway, long story short, I went off the Ritalin thinking that was the problem, but it wasn't. So then GP sent me to dermatologist to investigate the facial flushing. Dermatologist has been seeing me for awhile, running copious tests. Turns out... my B12 is in the toilet.   I am now on B12 shots. Only two weeks in. It is helping already with the cognitive symptoms, but I'm still feeling lots of fatigue when the sun falls. The fatigue that the Ritalin never touched either.   Dermatologist thinks B12 just may be the cause of it all. Time will tell. Reason for B12 deficiency: long term (10+ years at 40 mg) Nexium use. I've tried to go off of it many times over the years, but I have Barrett's so it's unlikely I ever will be able to go off it.   TL;DR: Make sure you get your B12 checked before you go on Ritalin, especially if you have no history as a child or teen that would merit an ADHD diagnosis. If your levels are subclinical, try oral B12 supplementation. It can't hurt.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Inaccurate answers?;;;I went in for testing today and I was asked a ton of questions and shit then my mom answered questions which I agreed were answered pretty accurate. After being asked questions I was given a few questionnaires to give to teachers another adults to fill out. When i gave my dad one I looked at it after and every question that asked about attention, quality of work ability to follow through with work and similar stuff he answered never! This in my experience of being myself Is extremely inaccurate. I brought it up with him and he said that I do that stuff but he answered never because it caused by me being lazy and passive aggressive. I tried to explain that the question does not ask Does your son have any of these problems NOT including if you think they are passive aggressive or lazy. Then he seemed to not even understand what I was saying. He said I just need to work harder and that I obviously don't fit the questions about avoiding doing hard mental work and similar things because I get A's and B's. This is blatantly not true. Hell I am avoiding work right now!  What do you think of this what are some recommendations and do you think his answering was in the way that they are looking for?  TL;DR: My Dad filled out paperwork saying that I am not inattentive or avoid doing work or do not finish work well Because though I do all of the above it in his opinion is caused because I'm "Lazy"
a7e19c6e31734ee70ae8b957564d71fa0a87ccc22c373ce19a1e0e765b387b7b;;;Creative ADHD analogies;;;The other day I was out with some friends. After conversing for a while one thing lead to another and we began to talk about ADHD. Being the only one there that has ADHD (as well as thinking about you guys) I began to correct their assumptions about ADHD as well as trying to give them a glimpse of what it is like having ADHD. After attempting to do this I realized, I don't really have any creative or at least a layman termed analogies to explain what having ADHD is like. So my question to you is what is your favorite analogy to use in this situation? TLDR: what is a creative analogy you like to use in order to explain ADHD to someone?
91fbd85d33aea99dba6279d6720d6c4e3664fde6d3c1017e7ede0a85634b03de;;;Quick rant about my doctor's appointment;;;Please, read the side note at the bottom before replying if you plan on it.  Also, I really tried to keep this condensed, but the sloppy **TL;DR:** After months of trying to get diagnosed, my doctor referred me to a commercial plychiatrist. But I don't know with who, when they'll contact me, or even how they'll get in touch. I assume it won't cost me out of pocket(since my plan is 100% free), but I honestly don't know. Extremely frustrated.  5th appointment with my doctor today. 1st appointment was basically a meet and greet. Second and third had me trying wellbutrin, which made me feel terrible. 4th appointment, got referred to the county mental health access line, who straight up told me they couldn't get me to see a psychiatrist.  So, today, 5th appointment. My doctor is frustrated, so am I. She tells me that referrals to that line are her main way of getting people to see psychiatrists, for many issues. Explain to her what they told me, and basically, they'll only refer(through the access line) treatment(theraputical), but they won't refer for an adult adhd diagnosis.  So, she goes to see what she can do(she quite legitimately didn't know how to help me, so she consulted with other docs). Nurse comes back, and says they referred me to an outside, commercial psychiatrist, who will "get in touch with me".  So yeah. I'm sitting here, after months of trying to get help. At some point in the future(no idea when), someone(no idea who) will get in contact with me(by phone or mail). No idea how long that will take, wasn't given any kind of time range.  I guess the main part of this rant is this. If I had told my doctor I thought I had schizophrenia(which is not at all my issue), then I would have been able to see a psych. Obviously, assuming the psych wasn't completely inept, would have said I have 0 schizophrenia symptoms, but then I could have told him about my attention issues.  So yeah. Lying to my doctor would have been the best course of action for me, as much as I hate to think that. Instead, I have some nebulous concept of getting help in the future. How hard is it for me to see a god damned psychiatrist for a bit &gt;.&gt;  (Side note: I'm super poor. I'm on medi-cal, california's medicare equivalent. I can't afford private care, nor any health plans. If going through a different entity was a possibility, I'd jump at the chance).

f814964afdab3ffcbeef340140f97b1477e3c08133f8c0b0fdd80b7eefc2bc85;;;Got some answers &amp; today's my first day on Concerta;;;I don't know if I should tag this (or even how I do that) so I hope I didn't do anything wrong.  So I had my third visit with my psychologist on Tuesday night where she reviewed the results of all the questionnaires she gave me the week before. So I fall into the "diagnosable" range for ADHD-PI but I'm not off the charts or anything.  *(Side note: she said because of the way Ontario governs mental illness she couldn't give me an official diagnosis...she's a licensed psychologist specializing in ADHD and ADD so I'm not sure why that is and I didn't think to ask her, does anyone here happen to know WTF this means?)*  So we discussed some things I can do to help manage my symptoms and she suggested CBT in addition to medication (if I wanted to try medication) specifically to manage self-perception and self-esteem issues. I've used all my "counselling services" coverage for this year but it resets in January so I think I'm going to do that too.  Yesterday I went to my doctor and she prescribed me 36mg of Concerta for 2 weeks, then 54mg for 2 weeks following that. But of course my benefits will only cover the generic version of a drug if one is available, and not thinking, I didn't ask her to put "no substitutes" on my prescription and ended up with the Teva-Methylphenidate version without realizing it.  Anyway...took it about an hour ago, so it should kick in soon.  I'm scared it's not going to work, or I'll have some sort of bad reaction to it or something...this is basically the most medication I've ever been on in my life (I also started Wellbutrin last month) aside from short-term things when I was sick, so I'm nervous about how this is going to affect me. I can only hope that I won't experience terrible side effects and that it actually improves things.  So we'll see! I'm going to try and update this throughout the day with my observations.  Also...having this sub to turn to when I was doubting myself or my belief that I actually have ADHD has been so helpful. It's good to have reassurance that you're not alone and it's not all in your head, and to read other people's experiences. So thank you, everyone, for being here =)  **Update:** It's been a little over 2 hours since I took my first pill and I'm definitely feeling more alert and on-the-ball than I normally am mid-morning, especially considering I've only had like 2 sips of my coffee. For a little while my brain felt...fuzzy? I feel like that's the best way to put it. That last about 20 minutes and now it feels clear. This is encouraging! After all the stuff in the side effects about how it can affect your heart I was convinced I was just going to drop dead today because of it. But so far so good! I feel like I would need a higher dose for it to make a huge difference, but so far I'm liking how this is going.  **Update 2:** I feel like it's starting to wear off already...I took it 4 hours ago and for a while I was feeling pretty good: motivated and focused, at least more than I normally am although it wasn't like night and day or anything. Maybe it's just not a high enough dose or the crappiness of the generic version is really shining through.  Pro: no racing heart, no jitteryness, I don't feel hungry but I also don't feel nauseated, and no headaches!

I didn't utilize any medication for it until I was 22 and sick and tired of not succeeding at college.  The 5mg, quick release, methylphenidate I intermittently used was amazingly effective, and I did great at school for the first time in YEARS.  It was a major confidence boost.    I stopped using it for a number of reasons.  One of the biggest being the autoimmune issues and chronic pain I've had since I was 18.  I have a giant cocktail of drugs that I have to take to physically function, and comparatively, the ADHD issues seemed tiny.  I chose not to need that pill out of pure stubborness.    After years of *somewhat* helpful therapy to treat depression and anxiety, I started with a **super cool new therapist** who specializes in how chronic pain effects the brain long term and how this causes negative thought patterns and coping methods to occur.    **Getting to the point of my story**.  The style in which this therapist works is to help the patient to be very aware of thoughts, triggers, etc. and to start recognizing, recording, and changing these coping methods.      **I am SO excited and gung-ho for this.**  This isn't just *'talk it out therapy'*, *'how are you feeling?'* stuff that I have had for years.  This is concrete,  'chronic pain does *this* to the brain **because we see it in all of these studies, and these things have been proven to help'.**      **BUT.** But, but, but.  I can't keep track.  I forget what set me off on a particular day, and I certainly don't write it down.  I just can't remember!     As I sit in the room with this awesome therapist I tell her, " I don't know how to utilize these strategies into my life.  I. Just. Don't. Know. How."    She replies "It takes time, but it will become natural and you **will** start to see patterns and remember."    "Lady," I reply.  "I don't think you understand.  I am a 27 year old woman and I have **NEVER** known when my period is coming.  I could have the most regular period in the world, but I've never successfully kept track and believe me, I have TRIED."    "Well," she relies with some thought,  "a lot of women find it helpful to use the little calendars in their checkbooks.  You know, just circle the day on the little calendar."    'Oh boy,' I think.  "I don't think you understand.  I have possibly 5 checkbooks going, I probably know where 2 of them are, and it's quite possible I'm bouncing anyways, so I'm terrified to try and find them and balance them anyhow."    **It is with this conversation that I realize, the way my brain processes thing IS impacting my daily life.**  It very well may be holding my back from learning new ways to deal with my chronic illness, let alone get over my anxiety of getting the mail (because I keep driving past the Post Office and now it's been 2 weeks and Mean Post Master Carol might scold me again for my box being too full)    So Here It Is: Day one of a regularly scheduled, everyday methylphenidate trial.  I saw a psychiatrist for the first time yesterday to work out any other medication modifications that should be made due to my cocktail being so large.    Hopefully with this new therapy based so specifically on the brain and thought patterns, in combination with a little extra brain power from medicine, maybe, just maybe, I will be able to make some real changes.

What are some of the things you hoped your parents did for you?;;;Short background; As the title says my son (who is 5) was finally diagnosed with ADHD. He is in Senior Kindergarten and will be in grade 1 next year.  At home we have charts, stickers, social stories and more all over our walls to help him stay on track. He has a sister who is 8 and a step brother who is 6.  **What are some of the things that looking back you wanted your parents to help you with?**  **Edit:** I wasn't expecting this many replies. I have a lot of reading to do, and I will try to answer everyone back

I always had poor grades up until I was diagnosed by my p-doc with ADHD prior to law school. I've been off and on adderall/vyvanse/lexapro/wellbutrin for the past three years and my social life doesn't exist anymore.   I tried to exercise and stay off all meds and found my depression to be overwhelming. I still live at home because I can't afford to move out, but I wonder if my surroundings is what makes me feel this bad. Just need some advice for long-term treatment options please, thank you.
5f9fc2ec0496580cb8ad30d8dac6f1471986a38270c68580a9fba991de717617;;;Some differences I noticed in myself after starting Vyvanse(ADHD-H);;; So I traveled back home to Brazil in this Winter Break and I managed to set up an appointment with a local neurologist that specializes  in ADHD. She actually interviewed me and my parents in a process that took almost 3 hours to complete and diagnosed me with ADHD-H, putting me on 30mg of Vyvanse and providing monthly coaching. She also advised me to write a small journal reporting all the psychological and physiological changes that I noticed upon myself after starting medication.  I actually wrote that journal and made it available in [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0Ou8Ssi41MHY1A4algtZk44M2M/view?usp=sharing). I turned to this community in times which I was completely desperate and desolate and received nothing but help in return. Treatment is now changing my life and I wanted to make this information available so other people may also benefit from this or acquire more knowledge in this topic.  I also have to say thanks again for everyone in this community for supporting me over the past 2 months and making me understand my own issues and limitations. I know that I'm now just starting to get better but damn it feels good to not run around my house for 4 hours!

You cant god damnit! ). I told him i know more than him when it comes to ADHD. I have read russell barkleys books and speeches, yet my parents dont anything about it.  They say oh well you obviously can focus because you read the ADHD books you were interested in. you focus on video games for 12 hours  HOW DO I EXPLAIN ADHD TO SOMEONE WHO IS SO FULL OF STEROTYPES!? for the love of god someone help me, my parents dont understand me the slightest bit, and i dont wanna grow up with us hating each other for the stuff we dont understand
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Doc cut me off adderall for no reason.;;;Hey everyone, I have a request for advice... I hope it isn't so frequently asked that is annoying but here goes.   I'm prescribed 40 milligrams of adderall a day. I've been on this prescription for about 6 months, I'm in my late twenties, and I also have a prescription of 10 milligram valiums to take as needed.   I see my psychiatrist or only about every 3 or so months. The last time I saw him he expressed a desire for me to start weaning or to get off adderall completely. I replied that it would be a goal I'd be willing to undertake in the future but right now I have an extremely demanding job chiefly composed of brutally dull and repetitive work on a daily basis. I've been quite clear about how the nature of this work makes my  ADHD flare up like mad, directly affecting my work a very negative way and thus endangering my job. I literally cannot focus on my work and will stare at a wall rather than perform the repetitive tasks that I'm expected to on a daily basis for up to 12 hours at a time.   Anyway my monthly supply is about up so like usual I called to request the physical prescription that I need to take the pharmacy to get my refill. This usually takes a few days so I waited and two days later (today) a nurse called and said the doc had recommended a "trial break/respite" and,  instead of scheduling my regular adderall refill, had instructed my pharmacy to give me a WELLBUTRIN prescription... Wellbutrin being a drug I had previously stated to him my distaste for because of the negative side effects I experienced on it.   So I'm basically stuck having already took my last dose of adderall today (I take 20mg twice daily) and completely going off of it and taking Wellbutrin in its place. (I'm going to play ball with him at first to show that I'm at least willing to try alternatives so that he'll hopefully re-enable my adderall script when his ridiculous idea doesn't help.)   There's nothing I can do as far as appealing to him to change his mind because he is only available every Wednesday and since next Wednesday is xmas eve I'm not exactly counting on him being available for a week or two.   One important factor in my issue here is that I live in a medium sized town (Bakersfield,  CA... not a huge place like Los Angeles) and I have health insurance through Kaiser Permanente (through my job) and in order to get adderall in the first place I had to specifically go through Kaiser's Behavioral Health Department. So visiting a completely different doctor not affiliated with Kaiser would entail financial hurdles I'm not capable of.  Just a consultation is like $100 and I'm not sure how likely it is a new doctor would just prescribe an unfamiliar patient adderall.   Many of the obvious options I've already tried with him.  On the previous visit I told him I would be open to trying a different prescription like vyvanse or whatever else there is.  I'm sure he's just being way of the potential for abuse,  but I've emphatically started to him many times that *I do not experience any type of stimulant response from adderall*.    ... But adderall is like a light switch for me in that it allows me to concentrate on my work and actually focus whereas without it I cannot keep my mind on one topic or train of thought for longer than  15 seconds. I involuntarily jump from concept to concept and people remark on how ridiculously scatter-brained I am.  I'm sure I don't have to explain to anyone in this sub what it feels like to have a thousand TV's on in your head at once with being able to concentrate on a single one.   I've tried other options like modafanil without the slightest inkling of success, at the present time my only option is to use my prescription until I advance further in my field to the point where the mindless busy work, data-entry, and ludicrously monotonous tasks are no longer required of me.   What do I do? This doctor doesn't seem to care or fathom that cutting me off like this, despite me never displaying a propensity for abuse, is severely endangering my career and livelihood by dramatically increasing the likelihood of me underperforming at work at a time where we are all being very closely scrutinized. Again, I have tried appealing to him with these reasons during my last visit with him a couple months ago  but it seems he made the decision on his own that I no longer required my medication, nor was tapering necessary.  Instead I am told fucking Wellbutrin is the answer.   I desperately need an effective course of action so if anyone can help please comment or PM me.  And if you made it this far through my long ass post you have my thanks!
cd23df17a6f170f4831c7457f9498426aa89f3ec5c782c3bd1175332b3aad02a;;;You are some tough motherfucker, you!;;;Whenever I read the occasional post about someone graduating or finding a new job, or when I stop and consider the stuff I have achieved when *average* people have not, I can't help but think this:  **We are some tough motherfuckers.**   We were born to live life on hard mode. On top of every other "hard-mode" like race, monetary, social or other situation. Every single day we have to face failure, multiple times even and the letting down of ourselves and worse, that of the people we love. And we do it.   It's painful being let down *and* mad with yourself, and on rare occasions you may slip down into very dark and dangerous places in your mind because of it. And yet we climb out.  We face the social stigma of living on drugs and even worse the judgment and ignorance that follows most invisible conditions. And yet we accept it.  We sometimes have to *work* and *push ourselves through* to "achieve" even the simple trivial tasks everyone just goes about doing effortlessly. Things like personal care, hygiene, fuckin eating and sleep. And yet we shower and clean the house (most of the times) and sleep on full stomach (if even it's fast food yet again) .   I know I kinda suck. There's lots of reasons for someone to call me stupid and lazy and careless and disrespectful and ignorant and a waste of time (literally even...). And fuck me, I have called all these myself many times and probably will again. But man, there are some moments like this that we all have to just look back and be proud of all the shit we have achieved. And be double fuckin proud because it's been achieved through adversity, and when the mind is the obstacle then damn, that's one hell of an adversity you have pushed through, you tough motherfucker, you...  To our successes, and many more to come, /r/ADHD.  Enjoy your holidays.  ---  EDIT: I am so glad that just my putting together of a few words can touch so deeply and positively the souls of so many people. I would be entirely content even if my post could help just one of you that needed something like this. I've read every one of your replies and pm's you've sent me. What we have going on here is and feels awesome. :)

Managing my ADHD with Vyvanse has been life-altering! My first doctor was very good at working with me for my treatment, however, I just found out she is leaving the state very soon. I tried to call another psychiatrist to resume treatment but was told she won't see new patients until March.   The real questions is: what can I do to get my refills in the meantime before I can get an appointment elsewhere? Is this something my primary doctor can do? I'm in the US if that makes any difference.  Any advice or insight is much appreciated!
7dd604aa7069b6400445f732d5bfcbaa578a546be91db3523335b65318469487;;;What happens if you were misdiagnosed but continue to take ADHD meds like adderall?;;;I'm 24 and I've only been to one psych who diagnosed with ADHD-PI. It kind of made sense that I had it because when I was in university it was hard to stay motivated to study. Like most people with ADHD, I can't focus/lack of concentration, I have trouble staying motivated to talk while conversating, I don't have as much motivation to go out to maintain relationships, I'm always disorganized, I have trouble remembering stuff, etc.  Even though I have the symptoms of ADHD, it just doesn't actually feel like I have it or maybe I'm just in denial. I've watched videos about people explaining what having ADHD feels like and yeah I feel like I fit some of it, but not all of it.   Videos like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GBMS7WPFSs  So my question is - say I was misdiagnosed, if I continue to take my ADHD meds what could possibly happen?  EDIT: Another question - how do you know that you actually have ADHD and that you're just not lazy or trying hard enough? ( this question isn't meant to offend anyone, I genuinely would like to know)
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;If not ADD, then what?;;;Here's some quick background before I get into the real issue: I was diagnosed with ADD at age 12, took medication all through middle school and HS, which helped a lot, and then stopped after high school. Fast forward 10 years, I'm now in college, and am extremely motivated, highly capable, and confident that I have what it takes to finish my BS in engineering.   The issue at hand: during my recent college career, I have experienced tremendous trouble with focusing on my school work. I am attentive in class, but am easily distracted. And studying and homework? Forget about it. I do everything right to try and stay on task, but there are days when I can't even get started. I wanted to try and get back on medication, but when I went in for my diagnosis, my analyst (after 30ish hours of testing) has determined that I certainly do not have ADD?   If it's not ADD then what is it? Is he just wrong? He had me take dozens of tests, and in the final evaluation, he said that I don't show the characteristics of someone with attention or cognition problems. I am extremely motivated, and want this more than anything, but I cannot focus to save my life. Hell, even finishing this post is becoming increasingly difficult. Why was I able to score so well on his psychiatric evaluation, but I can't even pick up the pencil some days, even when the stakes are extremely high?
e674413c9af3ab46908c6c0383f8e82ad14120da1dfd48eea0720631be35351e;;;Any Canadians still prescribed ritalin, dexedrine, or adderall?;;;**EDIT** I'm shrinking my regional survey to SK, before I assume my doctor's misleading me.   I had my monthly doctor's appointment to discuss my ADHD and renew prescriptions this week, and I mentioned to my doctor that while Vyvanse is great for getting things done, I don't find the motivation to do the work that I'm supposed to do like when I was first diagnosed and prescribed ritalin. I was implying that I wouldn't mind being prescribed it again, and my doctor informed me that all drugs but Vyvanse, Concerta, and Strattera (or Wellbutrin) are now illegal to prescribe due to their abuse potential.  I've had a non-Concerta methylphenidate prescription within the past year from my old GP before I had my psychiatrist for this stuff, so it seems weird to me and I'm wondering if he just thinks I'm drug seeking.
5d7e9fbd7ee554f607923c66dfdbbfa0fcfc71d2f48036e526379d6f755140f9;;;Advice for ADHD diagnostic;;;Background:  I am 24. I have faced video game addiction ever since I can remember. It got bad to the point where I dropped out of high school to play video games everyday. Every day, I would tell myself ok I will go to class tmr and I will just work really hard and get straight A's, but we all know that did not happen. I had to take my GED to get into community college.  First year in college, I met a girl, but we have broke up recently (Will get to that later).   Every year in college, I have applied for a full schedule of classes. However, when the semester starts 80-90% of my classes will be dropped. For the past 3 semester, I have went from full schedule class to 1 class/semester. I always get social anxiety when I go to class which ultimately leads me to drop it.  My girlfriend that recently left me has told me that I never stop playing games even though we broke up or gotten in many arguments about this issue in the past. She told me she did not feel love that I loved her. I always spent all my time in games. Which I did, about 95% of my time went to games. I want to spend time with her at night when she gets back from work, but i always want to finish some games first and before I know it, shes always asleep.   _______   Now to my real question. After we broke up, I was just surfing the web because I was bored and I began to read up about ADHD for fun because one of my friends has it. The more I read, the more I think of myself. I decided to take multiple online tests for ADHD and have scored almost full on all of them. Now I know internet/self diagnostic is not a good way to go so I want to come here to ask:  Do I need to see a psychologist (Don't even know if I can afford one?) to be diagnosed? I see my regular doctor in a clinic and not the hospital so I don't know how far they can get me. Any advice?   Did ADHD really ruin my life/relationship or am I just using this as an excuse?   TL;DR  Is it possible that I have ADHD or am I using it as an excuse for my problems? Where can I get diagnosed?
95ec598b58f6922943f14c43aa52f32230ea3d2deded13a9903eebe2056b40fa;;;my parents and my doctor dont think i have adhd?;;;Heres the deal, for the past couple of months, ive been researching heavily on adhd and add. However, once i told my parents and they said that they dont believe me. I have trouble focusing, i procrastinate a lot, i lose so much stuff, i basically do a lot of add focused stuff. I took many online tests and i watched a lot of videos on add and adhd. I just have so much similar symptoms. Except, the thing is, when i tell my parents about adhd, they said that im just lazy and i need to force myself to focus. I told them about meds and this is what they said "no child of mine will take meds!" I told my doctor and she said that if i had adhd, she would know by now. I have had the same doctor since i was 3! Im 14 now. My doctor is chinese so if that makes any difference. How do i convince them just to do a simple test? Its just super embarrasing to talk to my doctor and my parents arent any different. :/  TL;DR My parents and doctor dont think i have adhd but i think i do

Anyone got some life advice?;;;Sorry if the title seems really melodramatic, but it's the truth.  I haven't been tested for ADHD and I am really scared for my future and slightly freaking out right now and need to get this off my chest.  I'm a sophomore in Civil Engineering and I just failed my first class.  I don't want to brag but I've been an A to B student all my life, went to one of the best high schools in my state, but then I hit college where everything seemed to be moving so fast and I started making C's in classes and just now I found out I officially Failed a class where I tried SO HARD IN, or at least I thought I did until I looked back at all the work I did studying only to realize I really didn't do as many practice problems as I thought  I want to get tested now, but who knows how soon I can get scheduled so I might just get a screening by my college and see what they have to say about it.    I'm just really worried because it's never dawned on me that I might have a learning disability until I took this class, and despite my best efforts, failed it.  How do I know I'm just not trying to score some drugs to help me study?  What if I really don't have a learning disability and I'm just not as smart as I thought?  What if I really do though?  It's not like I want to be diagnosed with a disorder, but my damn pride makes me want to keep telling myself that I'm not dumb and the only reason I failed was because a disability is holding me back  I'm a little sad, angry, scared, and numb right now.  I just need some advice and maybe a couple life stories/advice that I might be able to relate to help me cope a little.  Was anyone else ever in my position or something of the like?

Starting off on a 20mg dosage for 10 days, then 20 then 40. The first few days were awesome, I also suffer from extremely high anxiety / depression and the 20mg vyvanse drastically reduced my anxiety and depression.  So I was recently prescribed Vyvanse to treat my ADD / Anxiety / Depression. I understand that Vyvanse isn't for anxiety / depression but I've been thinking that my ADD symptoms have been triggering the anxiety / depression. Or it could be the other way around, I don't know if ADD is the primary problem yet. Could be anxiety  Anyways I've been on Vyvanse for 5 days and it has been wonderful.  It has significantly been helping with both my anxiety / depression and my ADD, the only complaint I have is the crashes I get from it.   The first few crashes weren't that bad, but today it hit me hard. I've been having a lot of anxiety about joining my martial arts class and today I said yolo and went. And I experienced the worst anxiety in my life, dry mouth, nausea, dizziness. I'm pretty sure the medication was wearing off 3 hours before the martial arts too, I don't know what the heck happened, it was more like a panic-attack, I had to leave 15 minutes into the class. Anyways It's 7:38am and I have not fallen asleep yet, even though i'm home, i still feel anxious and I slept fine on the other four days of vyvanse   .. What do you guys think is going on?

I have been prescribed adderall 60mg IR for a year &amp; a half now. I know that's a lot but I actually only take up to 30mg daily. that's my limit. as you all know, it works wonders for focus &amp; concentration. my job requires me to pay attention to close details &amp; remember deadlines. if I don't I'm screwed. adderall had helped tremendously for this.   however I have noticed some issues that I'm concerned about:  1. does adderall cause any deficiencies and what vitamins should I take?   I have always been pale but I noticed my skin is now almost pasty-like. is this possibly because of adderall? I also eat complete shit. junk food. or not at all. I'm pretty skinny but at a healthy weight whereas last winter I looked like a zombie skeleton. ew. I'm worried of the possible internal affects adderall may be contributing to. and since I really don't take care of myself (I don't exercise either) I want to take vitamin supplements but am unsure as to what.   2. I drink a LOT of coffee. I would say maybe two large cups a day. is this terribly bad while taking adderall?  3. I was recently prescribed hydroxzine for anxiety. I will never be prescribed benzos because I'm a recovering addict. has anyone else tried this? I also have trazadone but it knocked me the fuck out &amp; I woke up feeling incredibly clouded, dazed, hangover-like. I can't afford to be like that.   the worst side affect from adderall for me is the anxiety/ paranoia &amp; racing thoughts. it comes and goes regarding how serious it is but it's pretty much always there. benzos work fucking fantastic for this but as i said I will never be prescribed them &amp; I would rather not seek that shit out if I'm not prescribed. the other shitty side effect from adderall is when I don't eat I turn into an absolute zombie. blank stare. complete psychopath. but when I eat &amp; get good sleep, I'm ready to go.   any advice would be greatly appreciated. thank you so much in advance.

So I'm a 20 yo female college student at a pretty rigorous university. I'm also a D1 athlete (so getting a prescription was a nightmare). I got my full eval done &amp; I got diagnosed ADHD-PI like... super severe. Eek. I also got "Learning Disorder Not Otherwise Diagnosed - Auditory Processing", which explains a lot.   I'm on:   * 350mg bupropion for depression/OCD * 40mg Vyvanse for ADHD  * I see a psychiatrist every 4 weeks for renewals and updates, and  * a psychologist weekly for therapy.   I came out of this semester with a C (failed a test before meds), 2 A-, and an A! I didn't go over my attendance in ANY classes for the first time ever, and my internship's been extended indefinitely due to exceptional performance. Even my technique in rowing has improved. I'm bragging at this point, but I'm so happy!  My only issue is this weird symptom that started a week or so after the Vyvanse. I have this persistent nausea, mostly during midday. I get this awful, almost dread-like knot in my stomach and weird lukewarm sweats. It's been going on for a month or so now and it's just every couple of days at complete random, although it was worse in school.   Negative for: mono and strep. I do have a bit low of blood sugars but nothing dangerously so, usually around 68-75ish. I'm thinking I've developed a random food sensitivity or the Vyvanse might be affecting my stomach. (No, I'm also not pregnant and it doesn't feel like a panic-attack)  Has this happened to anyone else here? I lost weight at the beginning when my appetite was shot, but I'm maintaining my weight now despite this nausea. I'm still as strong as I've been and I get my same numbers while working out, but I feel so weak and sick afterward. For example: I gag or throw up when I eat eggs for some reason and my stomach feels tight, like it's trying to say "nope", and it feels like this. Just want to see if this is a possibility and if its happened, how you fixed it. I hope it's not the Vyvanse, because I'm so happy otherwise. I'm on Ondansetron anti-nausea for this but I'd like to not have to be!   Thanks for any help!

I have read a bit about them, if I am honest I thought the next stage would be more of a stimulant than anything else.  I just don't see how Strattera will help with my procrastination, my get up and go and actually completing tasks? Why to me is my biggest issues?  Will these help me focus and get the task done?  Any advise would be fantastic as I just dont know where im at just now,  Thanks
62f7ea80a14d2adfec237bb2013ea113cfcbd4c845271f9c7285b642c30df8ab;;;Two problems on meds - one regarding sexuality;;;To give you a little info: I'm a non-trad jr in college (28 yrs old) pursuing a stats degree. Diagnosed a few weeks ago (parents refused to have me tested as a child despite nearly all of my teachers through elementary and high school recommending it), and got on meds over the winter break - noticed a tremendous difference right away, all for the better. I can focus, I'm getting things done, I'm doing my hwk, I'm managing my time.   First thing: Apparently, I developed a myriad of coping mechanisms for dealing with people and work over my life. Going to work this past week, being back in school... I realized how much I relied on those, because talking with people is *hard*. I can focus on ONE thing at a time... how does anyone have a conversation like that? I can't talk and clean, or talk and think about what else needs to be done. If I'm cleaning at work, I'm not thinking about everything else that I need to be aware of, or what else I need to be doing before I leave: I'm thinking about *cleaning* and that's it. I've always been praised for my ability to multi-task, and now (on meds) I can't. Not good for work. Have any of you had this problem as well? How did you move past it? Did you just have to wait, and develop different strategies as you went along?  Second thing: I'm sure we all know that one of the side effects of Ritalin is dry mouth. I'm having dry...*other* places as well, and the last two times my bf and I tried to be intimate...well, I was into it, but dry as the Sahara. Is this common???? I haven't been able to find anything about it.... I'm going to go buy some, ahem, liquid assistance, but it's very upsetting. I've always had a tremendous libido - something I've always embraced as healthy and natural - and now that's gone down (probably to "normal" levels) and I'm also having *this* problem... well, it's really a hard blow to the gut, you know what I mean? I'm fine with a decreased libido - honestly, it'll probably take some of the pressure off my relationship since I had a MUCH higher one than my bf - but not being able to natually lubricate when we *do* want to have sex... it's pretty horrible. Can anyone relate? What did you do?

So, between dealing with Walgreens sucking, my therapist's office and the insurance company, I'm coming up on two weeks without any meds.   So, I thought I'd share some of my observations of being off meds for an extended period of time:  * **One of the hits against Vyvanse is that it causes people to feel more anxiety/irritability**. I've definitely felt less of both since my little forced holiday * **Doing a better job of keeping up with things around the house than I thought I would** * **The ability to focus on things on work is severely diminished of course**. Reading isn't as difficult as I thought it would be * **Listening to spoken instructions is also difficult as it used to be pre-diagnosis** * **Overall fuzzy/hazy feeling is back.** I just don't feel as "sharp" as I do when I'm on my meds.     * **I'm not *quite* as tired as I was pre-diagnosis** Still more tired than I was while on my meds (though a six month old could also be contributing to that)  Has anyone else experienced anything similar (doing better than expected) after going on an extended holiday - forced or otherwise - from your meds?   **TL;DR**: I was forced to stop taking my 40mg of Vyvanse and have done much better than I thought I would. I'm not as afraid/paranoid as I used to be about skipping days now, but I'm definitely looking forward to getting back on them.

We didn’t understand that some brains just produce less dopamine. A.D.D. brains (and I use A.D.H.D. and interchangeably. You’ll forgive me if I can’t really track keeping it salient.) have attentive issues. Unlike other brains, ours are continually set on shuffle. We take in all kinds of stimulus like we are drinking from a firehose. We blurt out stuff. We can’t find our keys. We need constant distraction and attention.   We can be a frustrating tribe. I get it.   We have painful school stories about how we could never sit still or how a teacher would dump our desk if we couldn’t find something. We’ve had people in our lives who thought shame was the cure to our ills and dolled it out like mashed potatoes on Thanksgiving—generously and with a smile.   **I was diagnosed at 21.** I remember bringing all of my report kids from grammar school to the psychiatrist. In about 15 minutes he pointed out all of the comments that showed my A.D.D. brain: “Doesn’t pay attention in class. Seems bored.”, “Highly creative.”, “Fidgets through out the day.” And the number one comment over my 9 years? “Consistently disorganized. Never hands in homework.”   The doctor looked at me and said, “You were diagnosed a long time ago. I’m just putting the ribbon on your chest.”   We talked about medication and methods for managing the craziness. I tried the medication, but in 1994, your options weren’t the best. I didn’t like the way it made me feel so I passed after a couple of weeks.   But I wasn’t going to let A.D.D. continue to run me down. I was going to figure out how to take all the benefits and cancel out the drawbacks.   So if you're an adult here and you JUST got diagnosed, that's a good thing because there is a ton more information out there. Would love to help. I write about it if you're [interested](https://gumroad.com/ryanmcrae/follow)  Thanks. And I'd love to hear your story.

Just diagnosed in Nov.2014 upped to 40mg Vyvanse  Disappointed,was hoping to focus,quiet my mind. All I'm feeling is severe neck,shoulder and upper back pain. But after reading blogs I think it's cause by dehydration which affects the spine! I know my thirst has doubled but I've been drinking more tea, which is a diuretic amongst  my 3 cups of coffee in the morning! Seems like this pain is not a side effect  But as I can see I'm not the only one! Hope water is one of my answers or one of yours. So why isn't this pill helping me focus?  So very disappointed. Anyone one else have this problem?

I strongly feel that I have ADHD. FOr example, just one of the thousand things. I've been discussing this with my wife. She gave me 2 jobs to do when she steped out for 30 minutes. Change the vacuum cleaner bag, and hang up a picture in the kitchen. She even consciously put the vacuum cleaner and painting in the middle of the floor so I can't miss it.   I seriously forgot in the space of the 2 minutes it took to check my phone because it buzzed, think about where to plug it in, to do both those chores. It was only because she left them in the middle of the floor and I almost tripped that I remembered. Anyway. I focused on those 2 chores and did my best to complete them properly. Found a nice nail (no small task given that I've been renovating the basement for 2 years and can't find SHIT) hung up the picture, changed the vacuum bag, I was so proud of myself that I could go back to my Crusader Kings game.  10 minutes later wife comes home and starts laughing. I'm like WTF DID I DO THIS TIME??  She lets me know that she can tell I've hung up the picture by the fact there's a hammer sitting by the microwave oven.   FUCK  Anyway. Back to the topic.   Let's say I go get diagnosed. How does a psychiatrist know that you have ADHD? What stops them from saying yes and just treating you anyway?  There's so much info/misinfo out there I can't even begin to start figuring out if ADHD is real, not real, it's in your head, requires medication, is a genetic trait, and physiological condition....  Sigh

It has helped with my thought process as far as not thinking of a million things at once. However I still get distracted easily and not as organized as i want to be. Ive even implemented reminders, alarms, and a calendar. I just cant seem to stick with it.  I was prescribed Wellbutrin 300mg today, from what ive read online and heard from people is that wellbutrin works better for depression (which i have a mild case of) but not as well for ADHD.   Seems like my Dr. is started me from the bottom wellbutrin 200mg daily and is gradually raising my dosage. Im hoping 300mg helps or she prescribes a second med on top of wellbutrin.   Will i see a difference taking 300mg and will i experience side affects like i did when i first started wellbutrin?   **EDIT: Title error i meant to say Im on 200mg daily and dosage was raised to 300mg daily**

My doctor gave me the TOVA and said I am the combined subtype. I am very fidgety and talk without thinking. I have been hyperactive/ impulsive since I came out of my shell shortly before high school. When I was a child, however, I was very quiet and calm. I was never disruptive in elementary school. I have always been very inattentive and spend way too much time in lal-la-land. So, I am sure I have ADHD. But if I didn't have hyperactive symptoms until my teens, am I really ADHD-PI? Did anyone else have a similar experience?

What should I be looking for?;;;Mom's a wreck, but I grew up with the ADHD and know meds can save a life of hardship (ritalin 2nd to 9th grade).  Since I have no adderall experience, I've come seeking advice from the folks who have.  I think the benefits will be easy to spot (homework done in less than 4 hours and such), but what negative side effects should we be on the lookout for after he starts?  What discussions should I be ready to have?  What advise can you give?  And thanks-- I really dig stalking this sub.  Note: He is excited to try the meds; he's absolutely exhausted by his ADHD and he was extremely relieved when he was diagnosed and began to understand there was a reason he was the way he was.

I can create an actual workable plan for the future. I now know that my previous failures were not fully due to me being lazy and that my successes were hard earned. I have an explanation for many of the things that have frustrated me about myself and my academic life.   Anger: I'm mad. I'm mad at myself for not seeing a doctor a year ago when I first read the symptoms of ADHD and saw myself in them. I'm mad at the teachers who wrote "very smart, makes careless mistakes. frequently off task and talks too much in class" on every report card but did not suggest that something more was wrong. I'm mad at the school system that does not train them to look past the stereotype of what an ADHD person is like. I'm mad at my parents for not noticing. I'm mad at my mom especially for saying over and over "you're a very lazy girl" when I was a child and a teenager, embedding those words into my psyche. I'm mad at myself for being mad at these people when it's not their fault that it took me more than 21 years and all but my last semester of college to be diagnosed.   Nervousness: I'm starting medication on Wednesday and I'm nervous about side effects. I'm nervous that I might have an experience like my brother did (his short time on ritalin induced a manic fit that ended with him physically injuring his former best friend). I'm nervous that my friends and classmates are going to ask me if they can buy my meds off of me. I'm nervous of the people who will inevitably believe that ADHD is made up.     Hope: I'm going to grad school soon. I feel hope that I can show improvement in my last semester of college. More than that, I'm hopeful that I can use that to show that I am capable of much more than my gpa would suggest, hopefully getting me into a better grad school than my GPA would necessarily earn on its own merits. I'm hopeful that I can get my life together, get myself out of debt, keep my apartment organized, and be on time to class and work. I'm hopeful that the future will be better.

This have been going good but recently it has been a little rocky. I was starting to get pissed off at her because she would zone out when I would talk to her, she would forget plans that we would make, she would occasionally lose interest in me and so on. I feel the way have excellent chemistry and we are a great match. I was complaining to a mutual friend about her behavior and he let me know that she has ADHD. She has never told me about ADHD and I feel like I have been treating her like a total jerk because I did not know about her condition. Is it appropriate to talk to her about ADHD? Or should I leave it up to her to tell me about it? By understanding she has ADHD is making me feel a lot better about the relationship because before I thought she was blowing me off and I feel that she should know that. But I don't know if she will get pissed off, if I bring it up

I also mentioned to my GP that I thought I showed symptoms of ADHD-PI, even before I felt depressed. I read that all these conditions could be co-morbid so I thought there was a possibility it could be ADHD-PI.   -Inability to control my focus/concentration, constantly switching between tasks  -Constantly daydreaming, to the point where I am missing entire classes looking out the window  -Poor attention to detail  -Slight forgetfulness, but my family considers me irresponsible  -When working on a project, I am mentally checking out every 5-10 min  -I walk around my house aimlessly listening to music, bouncing an inflatable ball for two hours a day easily  -Simple instructions are weirdly difficult for me  -I enjoy reading, but sometimes it will take me a few pages to realize I wasn't paying attention and will have to reread everything, other times I can read a 300 page book in a single sitting  -When people are talking, sometimes it feels that although I can hear them perfectly their words go right through my head  -I had severe birth trauma, total blood/oxygen deprivation, and I was legally dead for 15 min. Doctors thought I would be severely brain damaged, but I turned out seemingly alright. I always thought it was weird that nothing was wrong with me, and I read similar events have been linked to ADHD.   My doctor thought that it was the depression/anxiety that was causing the ADHD-PI symptoms. He also said that since I've done so well in high school it was unlikely. I understand the symptoms overlap sometimes as well.  I'm not trying to self-diagnose myself with ADHD, but I'm going off to college next year and want to get this all figured out. Should I go see an independent psychiatrist or keep following my GP's suggestions?

644582acd99e2aff253878aa0a57ebe88bca42acbc080a926c85559f93ea6581;;;How does hyperfocus affect your love interests?;;;I'm 23 years old and was diagnosed with ADHD-PH only a few months ago, just before Thanksgiving. To say it's been one of the best things to happen to me is an understatement, my mood has stabilized because I'm no longer chronically bored (and unable to focus on anything to rectify said boredom) and I'm no longer doing nothing and hyper-focused on how miserable I am. I've also settled into a steady dose of Methylphenidate ER 54mg which works well for me. 6 months ago my therapist would've said I absolutely suffered from depression, and today I'm excited to get out of bed in the morning and do my job or explore all the opportunities I have. This is all still a fairly new experience for me though, and I'm still learning as I go.    One of the problems I've always had in my relationships is that either I can't get attached at all, or I get completely over-attached. There is no in-between, and this is obviously not a desirable quality for relationships or romantic interests. While I've noticed my mood is much more stable and I'm no longer beating myself up about my failures, I'm still falling into the same pattern of just not being able to get "interested" in the right people, and becoming too attached to people that it's just not going to work with. I guess I could describe every relationship I've ever been in as complete puppy-dog love, in a way.    I'm wondering if anyone has any advice or experience with feeling the same way, and how they've overcome or managed it? I've gotten much better at managing my emotions and making smarter choices, but to some degree, I can't help how I feel.    **TL;DR**: I'm either 100% puppy dog love when it comes to relationships, or I can't even remotely get into a person. Thoughts?

I think I'm completely losing it.;;;**tl;dr: School is making my life hell and I just really want to go sleep all of the time.**  I haven't really slept at all, so the coherence of this post is going to be rather questionable...  But. So. Yeah. I think I probably have ADHD? People tend to joke about me having it, for starters, and I was kind of a poster child in the fourth grade. Couldn't concentrate on the teacher, has issues "transitioning" - tended to get distracted on the way if I didn't like the next activity. Had mental blocks to do homework and got distracted constantly. Was always really fidgetly, and preferred standing up to sitting down and walked around the classroom a lot. Talked a lot and irritated all of the other kids. Really sucked with details, missed homeworks constantly, made stupid mistakes and neglected details. Issue was, there was another kid who was a even better "poster child" because he was even more hyperactive (turn out he was just kind of attention seeking? He didn't have any attention issues, and wasn't really hyperactive after the one detention and parent-teacher conference he had. I only know this because my mom worked at my school back then, so I was usually stuck with the teacher for an extra 15-20 min after school ended. Which absolutely SUCKED. But not blaming the kid though, he was pretty nice otherwise). What didn't help was that my teacher sucked and hated me and just didn't notice/care about this stuff and everything was attributed to me being lazy and just generally not caring.  Wait. That wasn't supposed to be so long. Sorry, friends. The number of responses I'm going to get is going to be very very small.  But fast forward to right now! I'm actually completely dying. All of my good friends are genuinely concerned, and my two (wait, three actually. I forgot about one of them because the other two are good friends.) favourite teachers have actually asked me what's wrong because I can't even get shit done in *their* classes. Haven't caved yet though. Nothing knows anything beyond the fact that I am dying.  ...I'm so so sorry this is so so long though, really. I'm questioning whether or not to finish it.  Guess I'll write more anyway. So now, I can't concentrate on shit. It's impossible for me to not get distracted after more than 5 min of doing a task. AND I find it really, really hard to read text that is long, even if I enjoy it, so trying to study for exams that I dislike is just a really bad joke (and midterms are next week. I hate AP chem so so much). And I'm really fidgety and walk around too much (thankfully my calc teacher actually lets me *stand* in her class. You have no idea how helpful this is. It has actually saved me before). My short term memory make the people around me laugh/cry depending on the situation (but mostly just kills me because I didn't even remember that calc homework we had a week and a half to do....and the sad part was, I really DID forget, it wasn't just laziness). Oh, and my internal motivation to do shit is gone and I'm really struggling in most of my classes; the only thing keeping me going is my mild interest in French and calc but mostly the fear of my parents getting mad. And my concept of time sucks - guess who loses track of what they're doing really, really easily, and never is on time to anything (I don't think I've ever started a long-term assignment on time). Oh and I constantly lie about this shit to everyone around me and I thought I had it kinda under control but everyone's been asking questions so I've being lying to myself too apparently. But I lie because I'm ashamed to admit how bad I am, honestly. Can't stand to really look at myself or tell anyone - why do you think this is on reddit? Oh and when I *do* try to talk to people *I* talk too much usually, plus I interrupt them, and have to apologise constantly for my annoyingness.   Used to have hyperfocus for reading too, back in elementary school (in high school now) but it used to be the greatest thing, and oh what I'd do to be able to study for that goddamn chemistry exam. But I'm cracking and I just want to go to bed but will probably just kill a few more hours.  Sorry for the wall of text. I wouldn't read it either.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Does it ever make you feel bad?;;;In my unmedicated state, I am a completely lazy and selfish asshole. I tend to only care about my own interests and feelings, I never want to go out of my way to help others, and because of this I don't have many friends. I just spend most days playing video games or browsing the Internet, which never ceases to get boring for me, but I am never being "productive" even if I need to be.  So that is my unmedicated state. But as soon as I take the prescribed meds, there is this change that is very subtle but HUGE like 1 hour later.  Now, rather than not giving a shit if I am sitting around procrastinating, I find myself feeling bad if I am not doing anything "productive". I start LOVING to do schoolwork and chores. It becomes much easier to motivate myself.  Besides that, I find that my patience and self-control *vastly* increase. Once I've taken my meds, I would not mind sitting in a 2 hour lecture. I could even focus for most of it, probably. Furthermore, I would not feel scared to go to my TA afterwards and asking well-thought out and clear questions, whereas otherwise I would just assume I knew the answer or not even care to try. Heck, if there was even a discussion section meeting, I would even go and fully participate. I mean, unmedicated, I would probably be interrupting everybody and making belligerent remarks when we are trying to debate/discuss a topic. But once I've taken the meds, it becomes much easier to listen to others and respond in a manner conducive to discussion. Sometimes I think I have good insight to share, but the manner in which I tend to share it hurts more than helps.  Anyway, I am just asking if any of you feel bad about all this. I mean, literally all it takes is a pill to make me "normal". I don't like the fact that I am so dependent on such a small thing. Sometimes I even cry because the differences my medication brings about are so profound.  Can anyone relate?

I feel this is my last chance - if I'm not able to make these meds work, I feel I'll be resigned to a life of self-disappointment.

I've (20 y/o female) always had hobbies and interests but as far as careers go, I've always wanted to work in medicine and ultimately become a surgeon, a passion nurtured my entire life by both of my parents who work in the medical field. I've always been a successful student, graduated high school with near a 4.5 GPA. My senior year of high school I broke--struggling with crippling depression for a few years my symptoms soon turned to those of ADD and I was formally diagnosed. Then I graduated high school, got accepted to all the universities I applied to, got settled into college in the fall and everything was fine, until my grades started to tank and my ADD seemed to take over every aspect of my life at all moments of the day. I sought treatment, was put on Adderall, but that can only do so much. After semester and semester of failure I started to accept the fact that there's no way I can succeed in med school if ADD has stunted my academic career already to this extent. I have taken a little over 1 year from school off to reevaluate my life and figure out what I want to do and still, my passion is there. I'm now looking back into med school and looking to finalize everything I need to in order to register for classes and complete my undergraduate degree. I was wondering if anyone had any tips or advice to help me cope from here on out, to prevent my past mistakes from happening again and keep my ADD and anxiety at bay. Any insight at all is highly appreciated! Thank you for reading!  **TL;DR**: Does anyone have any advice on how to succeed on the road before/during medical school with also dealing with ADD/anxiety?

Then I usually realize after I finish talking that I probably made no sense or was really scattered. I was wondering if anyone else had this experience.    I've never been diagnosed but I've suspected for a while, and even if I did I wouldn't be sure it had anything to do with adhd. I'm just curious your experience.

With that, I would like to ask the question, how does someone differentiate the difference between poor habits and ADHD? Especially when it comes to someone who is an adult and has never been diagnosed.  TL;DR: How does someone differentiate the difference between poor habits and ADHD?

Thinking of making some major changes!;;;So I was diagnosed a couple of months ago, and started on stimulant meds. My doctor warned me that many people make major changes in their lives after finally figuring out what was holding them back all those years.   Now despite always being told that I'm bright, and creative, I've ended up working as a truck driver for the last 8 years, because this is a job that I haven't gotten bored with, and one that didn't require any real organisational skills at all. But now, only a couple of months on meds, I'm finding it really boring, and I'm working towards making a change.   I've started a podcast, which might have some earning potential once it's up and going, and I've been offered a spot hosting on a pilot episode for a TV show. It's all happening quite quickly, but I'm not rushing anything.   I'd be really interested to hear from anyone else who was diagnosed later in life, who then went on to make major changes like that. What are some potential pitfalls to look out for?   TL/DR: did you make a major change in your career after being diagnosed?
9d5b3e796eecd1feadf0a724ff8dfbfa39d061d73b89472da4262789def9ea96;;;ADHD success story;;;So I am 22 yo and was diagnosed this summer. Really opened my eyes to some extent.  Also learned about Meyers Briggs personality types (ENTP motherfuckers) and figured I was a gifted and quite unique soul after all.   Started taking concerta late autumn.  18-&gt;36-&gt;54mg. Like a cleaning duracell rabbit on crack.  Lowered back to 2x18mg (can adjust depending on what kind of day it is).   Started working out again, paired with nice forests walks and occationally jogging. Meditation, some spiritual shit and newfound insights later - I'm the very best I can be.   So. I remember when I read this sub a couple months ago and pitied the fuck out of both myself and you guys.  Don't.  Change is in your hands.  If something is deemed boring or uninteresting,  that's exactly what you need to do in order to challenge yourself and grow out of your own habits..   Btw, some 5000UI of vitamin D and Omega3 won't do you no harm either. You are all incredibly gifted people with talents that can help others. But first you gotta sort yourself out. So do that. Best of luck!

I was hoping one day I'd be able to smoke again and enjoy the enlightened calming effect it used to have on me, but alas, that was like three years ago when I first did it and had my fun (I was 20, now 23). I suffer from acute anxiety and depression, plausible depersonalization at times and have an incredibly difficult time socializing now, or calming my mind to even focus on anything but self-loathing. I tried Adderall (sp) a few years ago, and I noticed I felt so calm, that it actually worried be, like a paradoxical effect. I'm wondering if I might be ADD, or something of the like, and if there's anything other than weed I could take to calm down? Would it be Adderall? Thanks y'all.    **[ADDITIONAL NOTES]:**    No, I am not diagnosed, **nor am I asking to be diagnosed** so please don't pull this post. I'm asking if this sounds familiar *to* those who are diagnosed.    **[A LITTLE MORE PERSONAL INFO]:**    -I'm afraid I possibly activated recessive ADHD or something of the like when I was indulging heavily in weed a few years back, as I never struggled as I do now beforehand. I'm wondering if that's within the realm of plausibility.    -It was suspected by my first grade teacher I had ADHD or something of the like, but was shrugged off because she thought a lot of boys had ADHD.    -Another thing is that I'd really appreciate any stories of being diagnosed, as well as your personal improvements on medication or otherwise.    -Personal messages are more than welcome.    Going through an impossibly hard time in my life, just reaching out.    Thank you for your time.

I'm really excited but kind of nervous.;;;Biggest reason why I want to switch:  I'm sick and tired of "having two minds."  I take my concerta in the morning and i do awesome, but after 6 hours I'm a useless piece of shit.  I feel so different on and off medicine and I really just want it to be a constant thing in my life.  I can't develop any positive organizational habits because I forget all about them/don't do them the minute i'm off my medicine.    Also, this whole no stimulants things makes me tired as shit.  I laid on the ground after work today and I fell asleep while my wife and I were mid conversation.  But i'm pushing through.  Let's do this!

6171f2b0b72ed2b2100f8187500f315f04cace9f542fbe14c0c865c975f6f2b1;;;My Journey to ADHD Discovery Story.. **LONG POST SORRY**;;;I apologize in advance for this lengthy post. A lot of my friends don't fully understand ADHD and so I've decided to join this community for support, and to support others one day. I'm pretty woozy from the temazepam I took for my anxiety so let's see how this goes.. (not sure how they correlate, sorry). If no one completely reads this, I understand because I understand your condition. I wouldn't read this if I were you, either.      I recently found this sub through a friend of mine who suffers from ADHD as well. My entire life (I'm 24 this April) my mother has 'joked' how I have ADHD, but I was never given treatment for this. I have so many stories when I was a child of how my ADHD affected my life then, but both my parents strongly believe that medication is not the answer. Growing up, I [would like to think that I] was a good student, although it took a lot of energy for my parents to make me do my homework. I scored top or second in my class from K-6, then the distractions of puberty began. I went from an all honors student to an average student, and then I barely graduated high school. I always blamed my failure on me being rebellious, but I've begun to realize that I don't think that was the case at all. I've realized that I am very forgetful, have selective memory, and my attention span equals that of a goldfish. I would constantly forget about assignments that are due, and it is STILL very difficult for me to focus on school. I'm still in school because I couldn't make the assignment deadlines and I even forgot the dates for a couple finals for my classes (it's really discouraging to see my peers graduate on time and work elaborate jobs that they found through networking, which is also really difficult for me to do).       This 'joke' that my mom made of ADHD was always in the back of my mind, but I never realized that it was real until (I feel like I'm going to get a lot of hate for him) I tried adderall for the first time. I have many friends who use adderall as a recreational drug as well as to study (I am aware that this is completely unacceptable). I was always apprehensive about trying it because of the 'morals' that my parents instilled in my brain growing up--mind over matter. Sorry if this sounds like an excuse, but I went through a really bad break up last year and I decided to try it. I got the complete opposite effect of my friend, and she said that the possibility of ADHD is extremely possible. I was extremely focused, I didn't bite my fingers like I normally do (dermatophagia), I wasn't on my phone at ALL (I'm ALWAYS playing games on my phone: Candy Crush, Mujo, 2048, Threes, etc.. In case anyone is wondering), I wasn't interrupting anyone talking to me or their conversation to word vomit what was on my mind, and I felt some strange form of compassion towards the close people in my life.       My current boyfriend, upon hearing this story, completely agreed with her, and told me to meet one of his best friends who has ADHD. After a series of long talks with said friend, we came to the conclusion that I pretty much have ADHD. I started to see a psychiatrist this past December, but because of my anxiety issues (another long story..) she advised that we get past the anxiety first before testing for ADHD. She does agree that I probably do have ADHD, as does my physician (I don't know why this is relevant), but I probably won't be able to get the official diagnosis until April or May. My anxiety isn't too bad (I'm on Zoloft 50mg, for you curious people) and my psychiatrist said I should be off of it in a couple months.       I want at least one parent to be supportive of my condition, so I told my mom last night that I had ADHD. It went like this:    *Me: Mom, I think I really have ADHD.    *Mom: I know!    *Me: Why didn't I get medicated for it?    *Mom: You don't need medicine, it will only mess you up more.    *Me: But there's science behind all the medicine.    *Mom: If you keep putting things into your body then you're going to get really messed up later. You just need to learn to control yourself and you really need to work on time management.    *Me: Okay...   So I guess that won't work.         A few symptoms I believe is correlated with ADHD (PLEASE correct me if I'm wrong) are:    * I can't be in a department store, Walmart, Target, etc., for too long. The lights are always so bright and the items lined up against the wall are so visually stimulating that it gets me light-headed.    * I can't focus on people when they talk to me, I have to be fidgeting on my phone, or playing with my Rubik's cube, or staring at something off in the distance.    * I drive with the window visor down even if the sun isn't in my face, because the entire windshield is too overwhelming for me to look through.    * My priorities are all out of whack, even know I know what the should be.    * It takes me forever to get started on a project/assignment because I'm constantly distracted by EVERYTHING--clouds, bugs, the floor, a crack on the table, peoples' voices, etc.    * If there are too many people talking around me, I can't listen to anything the person I'm conversing with is saying to me.   Those are just to name a few, and because I haven't been officially diagnosed yet, I could be completely wrong.      I don't blame my parents for not putting me on medication sooner. I can understand where the're coming from, and growing up they have always tried their best to help me succeed. But obviously I'm keeping this a secret from my parents. I'm so glad I found out about this sub. I thought I was alone this entire time, but it is very comforting to know that I'm not. Thank you all in this sub.      I apologize again for the poorly written post. My mind tends to jump around a lot... haha.       I'll keep everyone updated on my... Progression? Is that the right word?       Thank you everyone in advance who actually took the time to read this lengthy-ass post.         TL;DR a long ass post about my journey to my ADHD discovery.    edit: edited to reformat, but I think I failed... Sorry everyone again :(

Eventually I found about this one psychatriast who spoke with my mom and me, and said Im a rare case of undiagnosed AD(H)D-er.   He gave me a RX for 18mg Concerta for 3 months , and said to find another psych in my country or pay him a visit.    Although my country does have health insurence , I don't want to have AD(H)D label as it might later become more of a burden when applying for a job or going for higher ranks in law/government jobs.    Anyway, any tips how/when to take it?  Will I build tolerance fast? If I do, how to lower it ?    This chit cost me ~150 euros already,  that's a lot in my country.
b992a6d136e9f9186792d8e4372c0b3671d55e637d15590de71bb3fa84c31af9;;;Just got expelled from EMT school 3 weeks from graduation thanks to this curse;;;I'll try to keep this short and sweet. I didn't even sleep last night so apologies in advance.   To paint a picture. I'm 23 and I've been battling debilitating ADD since I was 5. I went to behavioral therapy as a child, I've been apart of many studies sans any ct scans. I didn't graduate highschool until I was 20 despite being given a 130 IQ at 7. I've been fired from more jobs than I have fingers. I've been wrapped Up in depression and self loathing since I was 16 because I could just never make it. I'm JUST finally realizing how great an impact ADD is making on my life, and not considering myself a screw up.   I've never been able to nail down a solid med regimen and I've been using 30mg aderall XR as needed. Which I'm now realizing was absolutely moronic.   I live on my own, with very minor support from the parents. I've been planning and workin towards goin to EMT school for 2 years, and this September I finally started, 11 weeks of full time class and then a 5 week practicum. I wasn't able to save any money prior to school thanks to living in a city where a run down 900 sq foot apt runs about 1400 a month. So I took out the maximum student loan I could. 13 grand. Well school was 9000 dollars all in, books and uniform. So that left 4000 for gas, rent, groceries (I'm an athlete, my groceries are substantial).   I worked my ass off during school, I was significantly late maybe once and was almost *always* the first one waiting outside the school, an absolute testament to how motivated I was... I managed to pull off about a 90% average at the end of the course and was the second highest in the class if you remove the second timers (there 6).   The program isn't like university. We had 2 mid terms and a final, all of which required ATLEAST a 75% or you had to rewrite, if that wasn't above 75% you were exited from the program. We also had scenarios for our midterms that if you missed a critical treatment or step, you immediately failed. So it was an extremely stressfullprogram. Our week was 4 8 hour days on with 4 days off (typical EMS schedule, except 12 hr shifts). I think I slept 3 to 4 hrs a night on school nights and maybe 6 on off days. Off days were spent literally studying all day except going to the gym. I was regarded as the maverick of the class, the guy who all the instructors expected to be working metro with them almost immediately after graduation.   During the program I dealt with so much extra stress, my jeep broke down and needed 1000 dollars worth of work. I missed my insurance payment just before Xmas when I ran out of money which required another loan to pay off the entire year (1800 dollars).  Then I stopped taking my meds after finals in December, I stopped managing my life, dishes piled up, I haven't done laundry since December, i had(have) NO money, my parents took over te burden of my rent. I never asked for help.   Then I slept in by 3 goddamned hours for my practicum orientation at school on December 17th. I literally slept through an alarm on max volume beside my head until it turned off. I remember thinking that night at 4 am after staring at the ceiling for 5 hrs "man just stay up there's no point". Anyways I still got my clinical placement, went on that and had an awesome time, the ER nurses said I'm one of the best EMT students they've had and wrote unreal reviews.  Got back to Calgary and a week later, Jan 5th was the orientation for ambulance practicum with Alberta Health Services that is only held bi monthly. Same thing happens, slept through the entire 45 minute orientation this time. I got put on academic suspension, with the clause that there will be absolutely no lates what so ever.   I went to my doctor looking for help, WAY too late at that point, he diagnosed my with general anxiety, put me on pristiq, which I stopped a week later. Feb 2nd I had my first 4 day tour and was an hour early everyday. The second tour last week I did the same thing, couldn't sleep, said to myself "just stay up" an hour before I had to get up. Slept in by 3 hours, and that was it, officially expelled on Friday.   6 months of my life down the drain, 20 grand in debt. I have to move home to pay off my loans, figure out my meds and hopefully get into see a specialist, and a therapist. I probably won't be able to afford to go back to school until September. The best part is that I have to go through all the tests and class again when I go back.   I'm just so mad at myself. I'm so sick of screwing everything up. So sick of this shit. I'm SO GODDAMN ANGRY. I let my stress build up because I couldn't handle my life thanks to this CURSE. Why do I always have to be a case of wasted potential, why?! My mom cried when I told her, my stepdad shook his head. I let the people I love so much down completely. I hate myself.    Tl;dr. Take your meds or you will lose everything you worked for in a flash.
647cbedcfe0dc6df0d3317392f2caa1513484489cf7cc7154be564e451199d75;;;Am I the only person who get's obsessed over new friends?;;;I have attributed this to my ADHD, but I am curious if anyone else experiences this.   When I meet a new friend or romantic interest that I **really like**, I get obsessed with them. Not in a controlling or stalker way. I just really wanted to hang out with them, talk to them, text them, all the time. Between the ages of 12-15, this severely affected a lot of my relationships with people. We would like each other the same amount at first, but eventually I would spook them off with my abnormal amount of interest.   This does not happen with everyone or even most people I become friends with. Just people who I admire and get along with really well. Maybe 1/20 people I get to know. And 1/10 people I consider 'friends'.   I did become good friends with my best friend, who I met in middle school. I was obsessed with her, but she was equally obsessed with me, so it worked out great. These are the relationships that work for me... with other people that get almost as obsessed with me. We just end up hanging out **all the time**. We are still best friends today.   This was almost always bad with potential boyfriends, because (as I learned overtime) guys like to chase girls when they first meet them. If you just throw yourself at them, they lose interest pretty quick! Even if we could have had a good relationship otherwise. This is why I failed to have a boyfriend until my senior year (I figured out the problem when I was 15, but it took my 2 more years to get it under control). When I found a boyfriend who was equally obsessed with me and I felt like I didn't have to hide it, I was really happy. We have been together for three years.   It's still not really under control. If I really like someone, I have to constantly keep myself from doing too much. I try to hide it. I tally how often they text me first and try to not text them first 50% of the time. I try to wait 5-10 minutes to reply to their texts. I worry about every little thing I do and try to not come off as stalker-ish. But I can usually only remain good friends with people that like to hang out with me often - if people never text me first or never want to come over when I invite them, it hurts my feelings.   It makes me feel annoying and vulnerable. I don't like that, so even if I really like the person I start to avoid them. Even though most of the time it isn't because they don't like me, it's just because they like to be alone. I get that but it still makes me feel anxious and shitty.   Lone wolves and me just don't get along :/
9dab2f5c24541eb2bff2d5aab026e486259fef05423d0d1bec01cbe6aa54d155;;;On 100mg of Strattera and not getting the help I need. But I am scared to switch to something else.;;;So I have been using Strattera for the past 6-7 years since I was diagnosed and treated for my ADHD, I went from using 25mg to 80mg for 6 years. But I upped my dosage all the way to 100mg(The maximum) this August. The problem is that I no longer feel like Strattera is being effective for me. I can't seem to remember anything important, I constantly double book myself, forget important items(I forgot my bike at my church and only realized when I got on the bus, had to walk back and get it), and just feel like I am going through life at the seat of my pants. I get so frustrated every time I just do something out of instinct and I don't think about it and I think that my medication is not strong enough for me anymore. It used to work really well when I was in highschool and my first couple years of Bible College but now I am not sure what to do anymore.  I know I need to switch to something else but I am not sure what. I am currently a designer at my church and I do a lot of creative work in general and I know right now that my medication does not get in the way of that creative talent. I find that my ability to just come up with ideas has very much to do with the fact that my mind is going so quickly that my ideas instantly come out of my head and onto the screen; and because of this, I am scared that if I switch to a stronger medication, that I will lose that creative impulse.  So I am not sure what to do. I definitely know I need something that is stronger for me because I can't live with this much stress because of the stupid decisions I make. But I am scared that I will forfeit my creativity for the sake of being sane.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Question about medications (not personal, saw a thing, now curious);;;Okay, so where I am from, we have Ritalin and Strattera only, so other meds I don't know much about.    Last night, I watched Stephen Fry's secret life of a manic depressive and one of the kids on there listed off this huge concoction of medication, including  both Adderall and Concerta. I was intrigued by this as I didn't realise that two stimulants  the same time was a thing that happened.   In essence, is this a common thing and what are the reasons for having two separate stimulants prescribed?   Not for my own use, I'm just curious as it seems peculiar.
67ce0987b264ead279e06dd0482cdfbee0709639d2534732ffa2e3a8d26f2ba6;;;I'm 20 and was just diagnosed with ADHD-Combined about a week ago, but I'm afraid to take my medicine for the first time. Hoping for advice :(;;;After this past quarter of finals and my uni, I realized that I can't keep working like this. I won't bore you all with my academic trail of suffering.  I started researching ADHD and came across this sub, (Thank you all for being here) and I identified all too well with what I was reading.  Last week after waiting months until reaching out for help, I officially diagnosed with ADHD-Combined.  I feel really uneasy about the whole thing, though.   Before being diagnosed, all I could think about was "What if it's just me? What if I'm lazy and just looking for excuses? What if I've done too much research about ADHD and now I've just started acting some of the symptoms? How could I really know for sure if the psychiatrist just has to rely on what I'm telling her?"  and mostly "I don't know what more to do if it isn't ADHD." and "I hope it's not just who I am."  Furthermore, my father, a family practice doctor, thinks that it's just my anxiety, which can mimic ADHD.  On another note, I was prescribed Adderall RX after being convinced by my doctor. I had wanted to take something that would have no chance of be becoming addicted to, (my family history struggles with addiction and I don't drink or have a Pintrest as a result) but my doctor insisted this would work best.  For all of these reasons, I haven't taken any of the medicine sitting on my desk. I don't know what kind of mindset I'm supposed to have about this. I'm worried to find out that it won't help and I was just looking for excuses.
b02afd8408b53d3630fa28b4042277d2605545a936c4c6b6ad5e1fcffee8151b;;;Just got diagnosed. It all makes sense now!!!;;;I just always thought everyone was like this. That everyone has their thoughts going a million miles and hour hopping from one thing to another not paying attention to conversations, lectures, important events.  It did feel frustrating for the longest time. Because I would zone out and my family often got frustrated at me. I'd get yelled at and feel incompetent. My family was loving nonetheless. They tried to encourage me with meditation but it never worked quite that well. This zoning out caused me to be anxious to ask questions incase people have already said whatever I'd go to ask about.  The constant yelling, mediocre grades, people making fun of me because I would stutter when I talked and talk about random things that "in no way connected to the conversation ( clearly it does they're just a little slow)"  Today I was diagnosed with ADD-PI. I'm so glad I finally have an answer.

dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Forced thoughts and possible ADHD? Hear me out;;;I've been dealing with this crap for quite some time and wanted to know if anyone has come across this.   Before I got to college, I was fairly well rounded and felt like I could tackle virtually any situation that was presented in front of me.  I used to think a lot about about everything, where I was going, where I'd been, where I was in that present moment in time. I always wanted to think differently than most people about things and create "new ways" of thinking. I was an excellent writer, as I was able to tap into my creative ways of thought and make each piece I wrote sound differently. In fact, I was able to get into college with this very skill. I was able to relate to others so much that I was told I was "easy to trust" or have a heart-to-heart with, and knew exactly what other people were feeling at any given moment.   Thennnn I got to college, and was introduced to this curious substance called "Marijuana," not sure if you guys have heard of it. It took me a little to try it since initially I thought it could potentially kill me, but once realizing it was harmless and not detrimental to my health in the long run I decided to try it. My best friend that I knew since 9th grade and I had joined a fraternity and his "big bro" was the biggest pothead I'd ever met. He said he could count on his fingers the days he hadn't smoked in the past year or two. He happened to be a very smart guy, one who woke up at 6 in the morning to study having smoked bowls on bowls the night before. I figured weed couldn't be all that bad. Naturally, his "big bro" invited us over to smoke frequently so he could hang out with his little bro and bond with him.   I smoked all the time after that, loved the way it felt and went crazy on 4/20 that year. I got stoned to the bone and had to go on a semiformal for a sorority later that night, and all I really remember was taking pictures of the plates and plates of food they had and being in heaven. I wasn't really second guessing anything or felt no paranoia from the the weed like I would in the future. I was foggy, but not worrisome. The following fall I finally was out of the dorms and had my own apartment, in which my best friend and I were very excited to have our own place and do whatever we wanted in it. After a sudden turn of events, the summer leading up to that fall my best friend informed me that his parents were keeping him home and that he wouldn't be going to my University anymore.   Fall came, and I was pumped to have an apartment in which I could reenact the "big bros" apartment and smoke all the time and not give a crap about it. I smoked almost every day, had friends over and played fifa. That semester ended up being a great one, but I couldn't help but notice in retrospect that it was a bit foggy, and a lot of the time I wasn't completely sure of what I was doing. The weed began to start making me think about things in strange ways.  Sometime between fall and the subsequent spring of my sophomore year, I made a decision in my thinking that it could be a cool idea to think EXTREMELY differently. I thought "hmm, what if when I was thinking about something, I went right back and thought about that same thing?" This cycle became imprinted in my brain and I began to second guess almost everything, things I had been so sure of for my entire life. Obviously the weed played into my excessive thinking about thinking, but I liked having friends over and smoking so much that I was reluctant to give it up. I began to not recognize myself, I created habits that were not characteristic of me and did poorly in school that semester.   I did, however, recognize that something was extremely wrong with me, and told myself that "no one thought like this" and that I should stop at once. I think this made my mind want to go back to it even more, kind of a reverse psychology thing. I decided one of the only ways I thought I could fix this was by getting a girlfriend. I had a long term girlfriend in high school, and looking back on it I felt as though I was at my best. I had everything under control back then, so I figured it would be a good idea to find a girl and have her help me straighten myself out. I found this really pretty chick, and we've been dating 11 months since then.   She isn't much of a smoker, so I began to lay off my excessive weed use and focus on spending time with her. At first, it felt wonderful to be sober and experience the world again. Over that summer, I probably smoked around 5 times total, got good grades and enjoyed my time with my girlfriend. Fall of my junior year came along, and I felt better than ever and optimistic that my ways of over-thinking were a thing of the past.   I was wrong. As I carried out my every day activities, I would find myself lost in my thoughts and in a complete whirlwind I couldn't get out of. I would be doing something I was naturally very good at doing, like talking to my friends or writing a paper. I would find them extremely difficult. My mind would return to this pattern of overthinking and shoutout thoughts that were completely irrelevant to what someone was talking to me about. The worst part about this was I knew I could do better in these situations, and could say very well-thought out phrases, but would end up only saying a trace of what I wanted to. When talking to my roommate, he would say something to me and I would give him an answer that a zombie would. I could tell he wanted to hear a little more feedback that I'd given him, but I simply didn't know how to get out of my mind. I saw this as a problem, and read "The power of now" by Eckhart Tolle. The book made me feel alive, and gave me glimpses of what it's like to be unattached to my thoughts. In addition, I tried meditating but found it hard to keep up with the habit. Even though I found these methods helpful, I still had the thought in the back of my brain stirring, "keep thinking about what you're doing." I couldn't stop!!!   I would find myself talking to family, doing normal activities, and feel a type of brain twitch while performing them. I'd be listening to my dad speaking to me, and feel a thought intrude saying I needed to "think about what I was thinking," basically. As you can imagine, this was very distracting and frustrating to someone who had no sort of problem with thinking thoroughly in the past. I wasn't sure what to do, I kept looking up different ways to become unattached to my thoughts but ended up even more tangled in them by placing new ones inside my head to help fix the problem. By doing this, I only created more confusion and made me feel completely helpless.   I realized that by giving my mind attention I was only making it more powerful. I would realize this mid-conversation and it made me think about the problem I had, and just end up confused and still struggling with communication. I knew I was addicted to thinking. I just couldn't do anything about it. I knew I should continue meditating, but it wouldn't help stop these intrusive thought from completely ruining my day.   About a month ago, I figured out that I truly was creating/looking for negative perspectives in my head and listening to them and letting them make me miserable and mentally drained. My habit of thinking about thinking had turned into thinking of the absolute worst. This is the polar opposite of how I had been my entire life, a complete optimist who looked at the bright side of things. I knew I had to see a therapist. I felt like shit every single day and that it was pointless to even try to understand my mind anymore. I felt like I was ruining my college years and that made me even more depressed because I didn't know my way out.   I found a therapist who is going to call me in the coming days to test me for ADHD. I can't focus on anything, and my brain hurts almost every day from trying to get it to focus and then drift away to pointless thoughts. February has been up and down, there have been days when I feel great and nothing can stop me while there has also been days when I felt like crap and like I couldn't do anything. I can't write anymore, I can't focus on anything longer than a couple minutes. I can't listen to people and give them solid advice like I used to. I only hang out with a few friends, and my girlfriend because they're all I can handle. One of my good friends that I've known since 2nd grade is my roommate and I find myself barely talking to him and being able to relate to him. I used to be a social butterfly and now it's hard to relate to many people.   I just want to be who I was in high school. Last night I read a post on reddit that someone just let their mind wander when they listened to music, and I let my mind do just that and had a lovely evening. Maybe that's what I need to do. I keep trying different things, trying to find the perfect match. I only smoke once a month nowadays, but it hasn't helped much. I still cannot organize my thoughts :(  Have you guys ever come across something like this crazy amount of thinking? Have you ever forced thoughts into your own head that could be unhelpful to your life, knowing you yourself was doing it? Am I doing the right thing by getting checked for ADHD? It just makes me upset knowing I could be reaching my full potential, but am holding myself back with stupid unnecessary thoughts that started when I began to smoke weed.

But I have also met a lot of others with the same condition and atleast a 3rd seemed to have the exact same thing I have. And some of them were just complete assholes. But blamed it on adhd. I have noticed more people at my age, 23 still using the same excuse.   Anyways my point is, I feel a lot of people who have adhd, who are also shit heads blame their adhd for it. Honestly you can be a good person and it's not hard to make changes within yourself. Adhd isn't preventing you from doing good things. Some people make life worse because they think it goes deeper than it really does.
73d059ee65bd9ed67153f7c34b7bff94ff5e58b1b88d1be8774f7e2ca508bc69;;;More concered with myself... (Kinda long, sorry);;;So, I spoke with my therapist at my last session and finally broke down and explained to her my troubling situation.   I had been holding back.  Not just a little either, I held back a lot. Things like my inability for math, writing, and reading. These are things we obviously all have issues with, so it is normal, right?   Unfortunately for me, no. It is a little weirder than normal as I learned! We started with math as that is something I had told her I'm the past was one of my least favorite classes. So, I told her my fear of letters as numbers. I am genuinely afraid of a letter being used to represent numbers.. It makes me very uneasy and it is genuinely unnerving to look at and I have no idea why.. What the hell causes that???  The rest unfortunately points towards dyslexia as I am almost 26 and I still can't figure out right and left and I sometimes write it on my hands when it is important, I cant separate and use b,d /q,p,g/ 5,s very well and I often interchange them, and worst of all ,I can't read unless I have a single line guide on the page because I just read all over the place with no control..   I just really need to see the Neurologist to help get this sorted.. It is really fucking my life up..
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;I'm trying Concerta again. Anybody out there?;;;Hi all. I'm very new here. Today was the first day I even thought to check if there was an ADHD sub. I haven't read your sidebar yet (though I will, it looks very helpful), so I'm sorry if I break any cardinal rules with this post. Here goes...  I took an 18mg (prescribed) Concerta this morning around 8:30. Last week I decided to try a 56 mg Concerta that I had from a former prescription. It was too intense and I wanted it to stop. Prior to last week I had been off meds for over a year and a half, but before that long break, I was medicated for over a decade, very rarely missing even a days worth of meds.  I'm doing fairly well on the 18 mg today. The "noise" feels dampened without being muted and the front of my head doesn't feel as heavy as it did when I tried the 56 mg last week (though some sensation of weight does still exist). I was more attentive at work than usual, without feeling zoned out (though I did leave a screw driver at a customers house and we had to go back). I've decided to commit to at least a week's worth of 18 mg doses.  I'm a 24 y/o man. I have a Bachelors degree in music performance. I exercise 1-3 hours a day, 4-6 days per week (road cycling and weight lifting). I work off the books for my dad in the home security industry 2-4 days per week. I also have a seasonal part time job teaching the percussion section of a local marching band (currently in the off season).  I'm trying meds again, because I'm unhappy with my work/career situation. I've been working with my dad since I graduated in May of 2012. It's his business so our customers tend to ask if I'll be taking it over when he retires (within 10 years probably). I've given this work a long trial and I'm pretty certain I want to do something else. The problem I'm having is that I have VERY little idea what I want to do.  I know I want to make money (lots of money), that's important to me. But as important is having a job that I can get excited about. I enjoy teaching my percussion students at marching band, but don't see myself teaching music full time (little interest in non-percussion instruments). I enjoy working with my hands and I also enjoy being outside, but neither is a must. I'm very passionate about exercise; more so than music- if I could study as an undergrad again, I'm 98% sure I would have chosen a health/ exercise science major instead of music. I'm too novice in the gym to try personal training, and I'm a mid level cyclist so coaching isn't viable right now either (people want elite level with 10+ years experience).   The point I'm trying to make is, I've been thinking about a career path every day, but have been unable to arrive at any serious decisions- it's frustrating. More frustrating is that now and then I'll come up with an idea, but lack to motivation to research/ pursue that idea.  I didn't have this problem with motivation when I was in school, something that I at least partially attribute to being on meds. I needed to take a break, because I didn't know what it was like to be unmedicated and back then if I skipped a day at a time, it would just leave me feeling out of homeostasis (tired, unusual appetite, confused, unfocused). I've learned to focus enough to work, but I don't feel motivated enough to be successful, so I'm trying meds again.  I hope this post hasn't been rambling. I haven't even really touched on my personal views on ethics/ health issues concerning this stuff (another time maybe).   Can anyone relate? Success stories? Warnings? Problems? Encouragements? Anything you've got, I'm open to.   TL;DR: I'm going back on meds after an extended break in an attempt to find direction and a career path. Can you relate to this experience?
b75b53450205776d9333ab7d49d7fe030185de4869aa5a025e94894b2aa5a9ec;;;How do you approach a doctor about being prescribed in a college town?;;;Hi guys, sorry if this has been asked, it's a little specific so I couldn't find anything similar when I looked through previous posts. I am diagnosed with ADD/ADHD, and I have previously been on Strattera. I did not like the hypersomnia that came with it, not to mention it did little for my symptoms even after two dosage increases. So I talked to my doctor about switching to a stimulant, and before we came to a decision, I switched to an insurance she didn't accept and that was the last doctor I've seen regarding my ADD.  Two years later, and I am attending a large university and as with most college age kids, Adderall and Vyvanse are being sold like it's not a felony... Regardless, I'm diagnosed and have no good reason to illegally purchase a drug I can be prescribed. At my community/state college, the workload was manageable with my symptoms. The transition to university, however, has been a shock and the workload is almost making my symptoms worse. I get good days where I overcome and conquer what I need to do. I feel so good about it, I try to keep it going. But then I fall into a period of "can't move, don't want to move, hate self for not being strong enough to make myself do what I need to do" for a week or so. It's like I'm depressed, only without the despair and hopelessness. I just can't motivate myself.  What I worry about, is due to the fact that this area is so inundated with college kids looking for a high/boost, a doctor is going to laugh in my face when I ask for a prescription. I don't even know if I should be seeking a general physician (as my last doctor was) or an actual psych doctor.  What I am asking, r/ADHD, is:  1. What type of doctor should I be seeking out for treatment?  2. How do I ask about being prescribed without sounding like another typical college adderall abuser?  Again, I'm sorry if this has been asked before. Thanks for taking time to read/answer!  EDIT: Formatting

I'm 28 and in college now and I'm struggling with classes and focusing on the lectures, I even have trouble with buckling down and doing homework.  I'm scared to take medication and become someone in zombie-mode, is this irrational?  I've always been anxious about doctor visits, but made an appointment with a neurologist. Should I make other appointment(s) at other places? Is there somewhere i can find a list of good doctors in my area?

However, even though I am doing much better at school it comes at a toll of my social life...   I wake up late, I have become quite emotionless nor do I care about others as much.  When I self-medicated, it was like a light bulb came on in my head and everything took 1/2 the time. I actually teared up knowing how insane it was to be able to focus without having constant thoughts coming into my mind  My question is : do you guys feel like it's a cheat code? I have heard the analogy of a person not wearing their glasses and that of a diabetic...

I was started on 10mg Adderall XR every morning for 30 days. A few days ago I met with a new psychiatrist in the town where I go to college, and after a lengthy discussion--that went far beyond just the ADHD--he decided to not up the dosage of Adderall XR. Instead he prescribed the same Adderall XR 10mg, but also Bupropion XL 300mg (mfg: Actavis) saying that it would act as a reuptake inhibitor? I complained about feeling a crash later in the day with the XR, so he said that this would be the ideal course of action opposed to increasing the XR. After reading up on it, I'm worried that this combination of prescriptions could be a risk to my health. So far, I've noticed I do feel a longer and more consistent focus throughout the day along with amplified emotions, however, I also have felt moments of extreme anxiousness. Does anybody have past experience? Thoughts? Knowledge? Thanks.

I was diagnosed with ADHD (Type Inattentive) seven months ago. In addition, I suffer from anxiety and have ADD (Auditory Processing Disorder). I take Methylphenidate (Concerta) at 18mg once a day,as needed.  My questions is what techniques or coping methods do you use while you are on/of your medication? I really want to make the best of this situation!

Still, this is a post dedicated to all those whom have knowingly / unknownly supported and dealt with me for all these years; I have learned so much from you.  So, to you my friends, family, colleagues and acquaintances, here’s my thanks to you.  I’ll keep this short and simple.  **1) Patience – To Forgive and Proceed**  As inappropriate as this sounds socially, I have the patience of Jesus.  I have been cheated on, betrayed, but strangely over the years I’ve forgiven them all.  Actually, it’s not the years, but within moments.  I learned that nothing can be solved by holding on to the past.  Perhaps, it is a blessing in disguise that I don’t remember much of it, or the impact doesn’t linger with me long enough to hold your mistakes against the future.  Is that better? I don’t know and I don’t care.  What matters is moving forward. Sure, you may betray or hurt me again, but I am wise enough to know that there’s no future to build upon if I keep letting the past affect the decision towards a better future.  If you fuck up again, it’ll eat you up inside way harder than I or you’ll truly demonstrate your apathy towards me.  Either way, there will be an answer; I am not hung up on needing one now.  People can forgive your forgetfulness, your weirdness, your white-lies, your inability to keep promises; but they’ll never forgive anger.  And I have that under control.  **2) Heart – Acceptance and the State of being Open-Minded.** We see the world in different possibilities because we naturally run off the tangents, drawing links that otherwise wouldn’t make sense to anyone else.  I’ve always felt for the minority, the outcast, the rejects and failures, I now understood that the kindness stems from understanding my limitations and the internal clockwork that defines me.  I don’t discriminate the fats, hate on the LGBTs, or close myself off to anyone that doesn’t speak to my language and needs. I always speak from the heart because I can’t exactly count on what my mind tells me.  Especially with all the variation and social cleavages, sometimes you just need to have the gift to faith to understand and embrace something with just an ELI5.  Explaining ADHD to non-believers is difficult, but through the lessons I also learned how to target my crowd.  I don’t need a bullet-proof argument filled with scientific evidence to believe something is true; sometimes your body language, your voice, your eyes and expressions tells me enough.  Maybe this will dick me in the end, but if as people say relationship (or success) are built on the understanding of compassion in one another, then in this spectrum, I am far ahead of you, commoners.  **3) Most importantly, discovering my place in this world.** A wise man once said, “Don’t judge a dolphin by its ability to climb trees”  In some ways, I came to the understanding that I am much more effective as a leader than a follower. My condition just doesn’t quite allow me to follow your directions to the dot, and I apologize for that. My friends count on my hyper-activeness to bring atmosphere when the room is dull, up when others are down.  Because of my condition, I hyper-focus in my thousands of interests, and I am always happy to exchange and share insights because we experience a different life, like people who read the same book but developed different conclusions. For what it is worth, I am the variation that exists to serve you, the balance to the group dynamics.  I may never be in your “in crowd” sharing identical characteristics, to give you the feeling of “home”, but you’ll always remember me as your bridge to the other side when needed.  And in this sense, I am the bridge that brings ideas and people whom otherwise wouldn’t be together with, together.  Only a handful of people I’ve met tops me on this, all of whom I respect and it is my motivation to keep developing to the best of my abilities.     Because I have a disability, I am stronger than you’ll ever imagine. Because I have a disability, I had the need to develop in areas that you don’t.  And even with a disability, it doesn’t mean that there aren’t lessons to be learnt and teach to others.  I am 28 this year.  There are lots of resentment and regret for not treating this condition earlier.  But please remember this, as quoted by John Lennon, “Time you enjoy spending is not time wasted”.  Remember the love and support given to you.  Don’t let anyone beat you down, walk your own path because we were born to do so.  Thank you.

There appears to be some consensus among psychologists that climate change is so difficult for us, as a species, to deal with because it doesn't trigger the mechanisms that motivate us to take action.  There's more to it than this, but, basically, the consequences of our behaviour take a long time to become apparent when we're tackling climate change. And, there's no immediate, obvious, personal danger, nor any reward or punishment for [using public transport/not turning down the heating/...] so we find it difficult to really motivate ourselves to do these things we're told will really benefit our environment.  It's like everyone *knows* what will happen if they don't take action **now**, but, for some reason, it just doesn't feel like it's really affecting us, sooo... we just... don't deal with it.   Is climate change screwing over the human race by not triggering the mechanisms that motivate us to action in the same way that the delayed consequences that occur every day screw over we with ADHD?

I understand that if you have a low activity day, you might get uncomfertable because the extra energy in your body isnt used up.  But I can sleep on a 20 mg dose - like take 20 mg and go to sleep and sleep like a little baby.  But i can also take 20 mg in the morning an feel uncomfortable and speedy in my body.  I have been taking ritalin since late october 2014 - so i am new to this. I am 24. woman.

I want to pick something different. I have two options now. I might focus on self-study program, that means I will get certificates and small modules but on same level as Unviersity Bachelor.   Or go to Unviersity Bachelor, but that means there are a lot rules attached to it. Deadlines, classes and so on.  While selfstudy, the rules it is totally up to you and the exam that you have to make, is up to you as well. So you can pick any date that you want and the speed of studying as well.   Anyone here experience similar here? Would love to your stories before I make the decision.   FYI, i just got diagnosed and got ritalin now from this week.

I've always had a rocky relationship with my parents (Japanese father, Filipino mother) due to various cultural expectations that  I could never live up to. I was never good enough and they never ceased to let me know of that fact. I have always accepted I would never live up to their expectations and felt like a failure and a bad daughter. I was never skinny enough, never pretty enough, or never smart enough and was constantly told by my mother that the only thing I could have hope for was to find a husband that was wealthy. Even in high school, when I was 5"2 at around 100 lbs, it was never good enough.   As a child I was hyper active and had issues concentrating, so I've been considered a failure for awhile. My parents would yell and hit me to get me to study and pushed me into academic programs that were probably not suited for me (International Baccalaureate program and all AP courses.) I was isolated from my peers and was not allowed to do anything but study until I made acceptable grades, which is what helped me get into a good college on multiple scholarships. If I ever asked to take a more normal course load, they would not have it. Anything else was a failure. They've always been overbearing and controlling. Since then,  I've put on about 10-15 pounds through college (I am 22 now) and whenever I would go home she would remind me of this. I work out and lift weights, but she sees that as unfeminine and constantly harasses me. In college I was unable to perform to their levels of expectations as I had no idea how to react to what I now know is my ADHD symptoms. I lost my scholarships and my GPA tanked. I had no idea what was wrong with me because I would try so hard, but no matter what I would do I could not concentrate. I'd lie in my dorm room (and later apartments) knowing that I knew I was smart and capable and that they were wrong, but I would be weighed down with so much stress and anxiety I couldn't get my ass in gear to get my homework done. I would try everything, but nothing would help. It became a vicious self hating cycle for years. I felt like I was broken and my parents reminded me that I was a waste of space. I'd try so hard but it would all be hopeless. Every semester was new hope leading to a reminder of my failure.  I did poorly in college as a Computer Science/Japanese double major and underwent a massive depression that I'm still trying to pull out. Three of my family died over the course of four years (one of them was like my sister) and I've had no emotional support from my parents through any of it. I had a major head injury but was treated like a burden and was forced to navigate the health care system by myself.  All of this made my ADHD even more unmanageable.   Mental conditions like ADHD, severe depression, PTSD and severe anxiety (all of which I've had for years and was recently confirmed by a psych eval) are all seen as an excuse for my failure. It's more proof that I'm weak, an embarrassment, and the daughter that has shamed them. They do not speak of me to people to "save face" now to my understanding. I've cut them out of my life, expect for a brief period in which I attempted to show them the Youtube videos, my diagnosis, and had my therapist try to talk to them in an attempt to reconnect. I was mocked and told that I was making excuses "like a typical American" and I should "get over it."    Long story short, I decided (with the support of my wonderful boyfriend) to work towards being better and went back to cutting them out. He also had depression and ADHD and asked me to seek treatment and eventually get a psych eval. I am now on Adderal and feel much better and have a wonderful therapist. I almost bought into my parents views of me and their view on mental health and I am so grateful I met him. I could not have gotten to where I am today without him. I'm currently in a new major (Information Technology) with a concentration on computer security and a major GPA of 3.6. I'm going to graduate this Spring. I am one of the Webmasters at my college. While my overall GPA is low due to my past, I am studying towards a CompTIA security plus certification and have high hopes for a job! Everyday is a struggle still but a constant reminder of how far I've come.  Tldr; My parents see my conditions as an excuse for not living up to the high cultural expectation and their life vision of me. I cut them out of my life, and am now much healthier. Has anyone else had a similar background with Asian parents, ADHD, and the like? How did your experience play out?

Due to the nature of this drug, i am scheduled pickup once a month and am not due again until 25th March.  I do not want to call my psych to ask him what to do as im not sure of his reaction (was on ritalin for 2 years and have been on dex for 1 year, without ever asking for my meds early [i do not use to abuse])  Im thinking that perhaps 1 week off my meds cant be all that bad...? or can it?  Any tips of hints would be awesome as to how to stay 'sane' during this time. Will i go crazy? Unsure of what to expect.  Thanks in advance!

Other than that I can't for the life of me focus on anything other than school (and that's just barely), and when I do - I completely neglect school and start sucking at it again. I managed to force myself to study but my room looks like a barn and I often forget to shower and let's just say if it wasn't for my mom I would look like a homeless person. I have all these great plans and I'm super motivated to kick life's ass but it's just so difficult to stay on track of my goals. Ever since I was a kid I just thought I was super lazy, and that's what everyone was telling me.   THEN I started reading about ADHD (I always knew about it, just didn't know exactly what it was) and started ticking boxes. I ticked every single one. My mom suggested before that we go to a shrink, because she was the one that had to put up with me after all. I always denied I was sick and would have these tantrums whenever she mentioned it. Boy do I feel dumb and sorry now. My mind is FILLED with stupid and unnecessary thoughts and I can't focus on more than one thing at a time, and even with that I need help.   I'm not officially diagnosed yet therefore I'm not popping any pills (I have an appointment in 2 weeks or so), so I would appreciate it if you guys could tell me what to expect aferwards, and if there are some tricks to battle with the symptoms before I get diagnosed because I have a million things to do and I'm starting to lose my motivation and confidence because I'm distracted. I have a lot more to rant about, but there's no reason to describe my symptoms in detail because you've been there, and I'm really not feeling capable to talk/type right now.

What would you suggest I do?;;;My spouse is currently taking adderall and I have asked him to speak to his doctor about antidepressants as well.  He shows signs of depression, not suicide, but general bleakness, energy issues, satisfaction issues, etc.  I am depressed and have been on meds since I was 16, so I feel like my amateur diagnosis is not crazy.  He also has had a history of depression as well.  His opinion of trying antidepressants is "too expensive, they take too long to work, I'm not depressed - it's stress"  These are all BS responses.  I think he just doesn't want do it and revel in his depression - which is something depressed people do.    Is there another way I might address this issue with him, besides being upfront?  I've also tried ignoring it, being supportive, being kind and trying to have enough optimism for our family.  He is stressed out for sure, being a returning student at a very difficult school, but he needs more help than adderall and monsters and I can provide.    For those who take antidepressants and ADHD meds, how do you think they have helped you, if at all?  He reads this subreddit alot, so I hope he sees this, and the community members responses.  Thanks   TL;DR ADHD spouse probably needs antidepressants as well, but refuses to consider the ides based on non-science reasons.

The thing is, that those games are "forgiving". They never put any kind of timed pressure on you, you have all the time in the world to make your decisions - and even if you fail at a certain task, you can start over. That's probably why TwitchPlaysPokémon worked so well.  Well, here is the real world and here is a situation: We (my girlfriend and I) recently (semi-)adopted a puppy. Semi-adopted, because we originally were asked to look after him for 2-3 weeks, but it seems like it's going to stick with us.  Here comes the problem: A small puppy dog is not forgiving. You don't really have time to think through your decisions. I have read ***tons*** of material on how to train a dog, but those are useless, if I don't have the ability to execute those ideas.   Doggy does something bad, I wait half a minute and then I realize I should have said "No, stop it." Puppy is biting my hand and I mindlessly scratch his belly.  I know that a lot of Cesar Millan's stuff is flawed, because it is based on false premises. But my problem is, that I am just not there, as he would put it. I am *never* just there. I am never fully in the situation, my mind is constantly thinking about the next thing, decisions take ages and I get angry at myself for forgetting the stupidest things.  Yeah, maybe good that the puppy is truly exposing those flaws. But I am irritated, my girlfriend as irritated and even my girlfriends mother is irritated, after she tried to teach me one afternoon the basics of dog training, and finally though that I must be somewhat stupid, if I don't get it.  I get it! And even that makes me angry. I get everything, I know everything, but I don't know how to react quickly and use the right information at the right time.

However I'm worried about potential side effects like tics and obsessive thoughts. What are your experiences?;;;I've been diagnosed with ADHD-PI by a psychologist who specializes in treating educational impairments and learning disabilities. It was nice getting a concrete result from an actual test, unlike my experience with psychiatry.  I'm really worried about potential the side effects of medication due to previous experiences. I'm especially concerned about increased obsessive thoughts and blurting/vocal tics. This is why I'm going to be meeting with a pharmacist to discuss treatment options and potential side effects before meeting with my psychiatrist.  What have your experiences been like?

I am extremely certain I have ADHD. I have always been that guy who can't really focus. I honestly have trouble reading a paragraph in a book without spacing out on some tagent. I have to do something constantly or I lose my mind. This is why I played so many video games as a kid. I also heard people with ADHD have addictive personalities so they can end up overweight from eating a lot and doing drugs as well. I used to be overweight and I loved to eat as an activity because it was something to take up time (weird huh). Anyway where do I go to get a diagnosis and who will prescribe medication? Would I be able to tell them that I want a specific treatment like Adderall instead of Ritalin?

I'm a 19/M college student that was diagnosed about five months ago with ADHD-PI. I've been playing around with meds since December -- first got put on Adderall XR 20mg/day, but stopped because the crashes were horrible for me. Then got prescribed Vyvanse 30mg/day, but that felt like I was taking a placebo.  Then, yesterday, I got my dose pushed up to 50mg/day. Can't really tell so far if it's helping or not. Anyway, before I walked out with my prescription, I was administered a cheek swab test that's supposed to find out what medication and dosage combo is most compatible with my metabolism and genetic code. I'm supposed to get the customized prescription in about a month, when my Vyvanse script runs out. So after getting home, I looked this up on the web and found that it's a fairly new technology, but not a lot of other info, and that's why I'm here. I'm curious about others' experiences with this.  So, anybody ever done this test? If you have, what were your results?  edit: clarity and bad writing

Now I have been using clonazapam and have been off of of weed.   I have been formally tested and undergone CBT and been diagnosed with ADHD-inattentive and Generalized Anxiety Disorder.   My question to you folks is how your pDoc went about treating both conditions.   Were you able to be prescribed both clonazapam and a stimulant? What were your doctors main concerns?

I feel more focused, calm and coherent, but i find it really difficult to direct that focus to things i need to be doing instead of pointless activities, and to getting organised/motivated. I'm not too concerned, as i think behavioural therapy will help me to break these issues down a bit (diagnosed at 21 yrs so have some habits i've used as coping strategies- hard to alter behaviour after so long!). But, i've also had a weird experience of being more clear and collected mentally (except for bouts of anxious feelings) but my body is kinda pent up and tensed, like i clench my teeth and my muscles are tensed up ect. I also get super sleepy around dinner time but then wake up again and find it hard to sleep at a reasonable time. Just wondered how others have reacted to concerta in both positive/negative ways, and if they have had a better experience with another med?

Currently taking 20 mg XR. I usually take it sometime between 8 and 10 am.   My question is about alcohol. I'm in college and I drink most weekends. I don't take Adderall on the weekends though, so obviously haven't had any interactions then. But there have been a few week days I've taken my Adderall in the morning, and then had a few drinks in the evening. Today, for example, I took the Adderall at 8:30 am and had a beer around 6 pm. Before I was even halfway through the beer I got a pounding and throbbing headache. I've done this once or twice before and experienced the exact same thing.   I try to drink a lot of water and make sure I eat during the day, so I don't think it's being caused by dehydration or lack of food. I tried taking some Advil, laying down, drinking more water, but nothing helps at all and it just gets worse and worse. I have no other "symptoms", just the headache.   I have tried to do some research on my own, but couldn't find much of anything relating specifically to headaches. I know that Adderall + alcohol is generally a bad combination, but am I not even going to be able to have 1 beer on the days I take Adderall? Has anyone else experienced this? Any advice?   Thanks!

However, only 5% of adult patients have true ADD/ADHD. In addition, the symptoms can present differently in adults than they do in children.   In adults, the most debilitating problems resulting from ADD/ADHD are the executive functions such as:  planning, prioritizing, impulse control, maintaining motivation, organizing, and working memory. Patients with ADD/ADHD can be frustrating for the patient and their families as well as the doctors who are treating them.  I will describe some of the ways that ADD/ADHD can impair our patients' health and safety and then discuss some ways that you can help your patients.  How does impaired executive functioning affect the health of our patients?    1.     Higher risk of substance abuse - 10-25% prevalence    2.     Late or missed medical appointments    3.     Non-compliance or missed medications    4.     Increase impulsivity and risk of contracting STDs    5.     High prevalence of motor vehicle accidents    6.     Underperforming at work  7.     Low self-esteem    8.     Increased risk of depression and anxiety    9.     Difficulty with sleep    10.  Trouble with relationships    5 ways that we can help our patients:    Many patients are often not diagnosed as children. Thus, by using a simple 5 minute screening tool in the office or waiting room, we can help our patients that may have been misdiagnosed as borderline, chronically depressed, anxious or bipolar disorder.     Here is a site that you can give your patients:  http://counsellingresource.com/lib/quizzes/adhd-testing/adhd-asrs/  1. Many patients feel that ADD/ADHD is not a "real diagnosis" and thus don't get evaluated or treated. However, by explaining to the patients that SPECT and PET scans show differential blood flow in the prefrontal cortex in ADD/ADHD patients versus non-ADHD patients can help reinforce to the patient that this is a "real" issue.    2. Patients with ADD/ADHD have difficulty with planning and time management. Thus, they often forget their appointments or are late.     This can be extremely annoying for a busy clinician, in addition, to the patient not getting the necessary care.     Thus, a way of improving the show rate for these patients includes encouraging them to write the appointment in their calendars immediately when the appointment is made, requesting that they show up 30 minutes before their appointments, calling them the morning of their appointments (not the night before) and by charging them for missed appointments.    3. Encouraging your patients to purchase a weekly calendar and to use it on a regular basis instead of relying on post-it notes or on smart phone. Many ADD/ADHD patients do better when they see things visually.    4. Help the ADD/ADHD patient to see that they have many strengths and that ADD/ADHD is just one aspect of who they are. In addition, even though they have compensated for it most of their lives, validate that it may have been a difficult struggle and that it can get better.    5. Help the patient to understand that many of their behaviors such as underperforming at work, engaging in high risk sexual activity, or challenges in their relationships are very common in patients with ADD/ADHD and that this can get better over time with treatment, either medications or behavioral treatments.    Working with patients who have ADD/ADHD can be frustrating at times, but can be extremely rewarding. Just like cigarette cessation, it can have a significant impact on a patient's life, but with appropriate diagnosis, treatment, and intervention, a patient's health and well-being can greatly improve.

I have ADHD, OCD, and BP1. I basically haven't consistently exercised since the age of 19. I'm not overweight, but I feel terrible, and I want to exercise, but when I do, I either injure myself, or get scared that I'm going to injure myself, and so I don't.  Main impediment to lifting weights is an injured oblique I obtained from squatting in 2013. Main impediment to running is an injured menisci on left leg.  Also, I'm worried my heart is going to explode with exercise in addition to my meds (50 mg Vyvanse). I have this stupid obsession that I have some undiagnosed heart problem, and it fucks with me to the point where I feel de-motivated to exercise, which, if I really do have said undiagnosed heart problem, is probably making it worse.  tl;dr How do I go from couch potato to consistent exerciser?

I was diagnosed with ADHD 15 years ago, my mother thought it was a "fad" refused to medicate. She pulled me out of therapy and that was that. I completely fuck up school and life, despite being pretty sharp. I got into a HS with a 3% acceptance rate, I just could not deal with the pressures. I assume it's ADHD related, it fits the textbook definition.   I have taken Adderall and I have it available to me when I need it. I would say I take it 3-5x a month, depending on my school &amp; work work load. When I have to get my shit together and focus, it helps immensely. I feel like I'd like to try a lower dose on a daily basis and see how well that helps me in my day-to-day.   Should I even mention this to my therapist? I hate the idea of hiding it from them, but I also want to say "Hey, this works in high doses, can we try it in a different way?" Obviously they can't prescribe, but my regular doctor can and will on a recommendation. I am not a "Seeker" by any means. I can afford to buy as much as I need on a regular basis if I really want to. I would just prefer to be upfront about wanting to be monitored by a doctor and have things be legit.   Sorry if this is asked a lot, I haven't found a similar post

I have been feeling down lately and I remembered how my new doc asked me about certain things that checked if it was in fact Bipolar Disorder instead of ADHD. All the bipolar specific symptoms didn't seem to pertain to me atm but now sitting here I question if maybe it is actually Bipolar Disorder instead of ADHD. The symptoms are so similar and I'm second guessing myself.  **How do you know for sure if its ADHD or Bipolar Disorder?**
dd80e8a6bd6367f9681549e48a7b96f607c4207e876aad18bf681c93e5242329;;;Helping or hindering my partner with ADHD? How much help is "too much"?;;;Hi guys - hoping for some insight. My long term boyfriend has ADHD and now that he's out of university and we're travelling/teaching English he's not taking adderall (which I support). His ADHD affects him in a variety of ways -- he's forgetful, curious, scatterbrained, and very self absorbed (I say this in a light sense, much different than selfish)  Me - I am type A worrier and I plan like a motherfucker. I keep this relationship glued together. I remember and plan everything. It's hard on me because taking "care" of him makes my anxiety spike. If I let one ball drop, he doesn't pick it up. Ex: I give him the responsibility of checking our flight time. He forgets, thinks he remembers, we miss our flight. I don't ask him where he puts his keys, the next morning they're lost (left in his motorbike, in the garage... fourth time this week). If I don't keep track of all of his stuff, plus our appointments, plus our plans, plus his family committments .... it gets dropped.  It's hard on us because first of all, I'm not his mother or employee, I'm his girlfriend. Second, I need to take care of my anxiety and I worry enough about controlling every aspect of life, it's hard when he forgets/loses something/causes a negative outcome and it reaffirms my anxious thoughts of "If I can control everything, nothing will go wrong". Plus, it makes him feel like such a fuck up (which he's not, he does try hard to help).  It's come to the point where I've acccepted I should doubletime and take care of all his things. That I should remind him to take notes, put up sticky notes for him, put alarms in his phone, keep track of his stuff, and make sure I do the important tasks (booking flights, packing, etc.) but he says this makes him "lazy" and therefore more prone to drop the ball if it gets passed to him.  What do I do? How can I help him exercise his brain? How can I work in a way that maybe I'm not impacted so much, like hours spent walking around because he doesn't know where he parked or a $300 flight or locked out of the house ....  Any tips appreciated. I love him and I'm sticking this out, I just want him to be happy and feel empowered and not babied (and, for me to not go crazy in the process!).   tldr: How do I help my forgetful ADHD scatterbrained bf and not hinder him by doing too much for him?  Thanks :)

Then when I'm alone and search deep within myself I figure out I am pretty stoic, coldlike figure that among people goes on autopilot of cracking jokes while processing inside some serious stuff.   For example I speak of reddit/4chan trolls and everyone laughs ( and i barely know what im talking ) and in my mind im thinking about physics and world peace.  If you would've asked me after cracking my joke to repeat it, I would ask you " what joke? ".   It's like I have this disconnection between my inner self and outer self.   Where outerself ( the impulsive part) was born because of social pressures for being labeled as absentminded/shy guy( the inner self ).   When I'm alone, I think and work like some grumpy/serious old man. And that's how I see myself.   Yet because of my big mouth people always think I'm childish. When in reality I'm pretty serious person.   How do I stop being such a loudmouth? Sure with guys I get accepted, but with girls I look childish and immature.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;I Hate everyone;;;No one ive ever met in my entire life has understood me including my family (they have always abused me physically and verbally and emotionally) and always said I was responsible for everything wrong ( even when something went wrong at my father's or mothers work , my brother used to beat the crap out of me whenever I did something that he didn't like ). I've always wanted to become a successful man  And since medication is not available on this shithole which we call a fucking country I am not able to achieve. Now my school teachers.. They always blame me for everything that goes wrong in the classroom.. And deliberately ask questions when I am not paying attention. I told my psychology teacher once she referred me to psychiatrist where I got my diagnosis. But my family says he is faking his symptoms he is a big fat liar So what should I do ??  1. Leave house asap ( I am 17) 2. Call the police  And lastly do I owe anything to my family, friendz and teachers??
4bef3b7009a05d9dfc29a9db8d8250a772144b80df4f13764caae76fed107261;;;Am I just making excuses for my actions?;;;I don't know how to rephrase the question. I feel like I am a very level headed, decently smart, down to earth person. But I can't concentrate on anything. I cant focus no matter how hard I try. And yes I am trying, extremely hard. Writing this is even difficult. Ever since I got a new job as a supervisor in July I have been noticing how forgetful I am and how much I procrastinate on things. It is definitely affecting my performance and my boss is starting to notice that I'm not just making those mistakes because I'm the new guy. He is realizing it's going to be a constant thing. He took me off the schedule all this week because we are "low on work" but I saws the schedule... theres a ton of work, some of them are even at jobs that I started (construction). It is creating a lot of stress at home since I got married in November and I feel like my wife thinks I'm lazy. I try to do everything for her, but when she gets home there is still so much not done. She is very understanding and doesn't put me down or anything, but I can tell it irritates her. When we "fight" I cant even concentrate then. 99% of the time I couldn't tell you what started the fight by the end of it. I just get overloaded when it happens and my brain kind of short circuits and I can't focus or anything and it makes it 100x worse.   For about 6 months now I have realized I share the symptoms of ADHD. I am 23 and have never been diagnosed. My parents aren't exactly the type to bring me to the doctor for every little thing. They probably don't know the warning signs for ADHD still. I know I didn't. Whatever is happening is affecting my life in a very negative way. I don't think I am depressed, though I want to look into that more. I have had slight anxiety lately but I don't think that is it either. I have noticed lately that I don't think like everybody else and that it is not normal.   My question is: am I trying to make an excuse for myself or could I actually have a problem? Making excuses is NOT in my personality. I own up to everything and am very truthful all of the time. I value my integrity more than most of my qualities. I just want an answer but I don't know where to start. It is overwhelming and just one more thing to add to the list of crap to think about.   I'm not asking for a diagnosis, because I'm assuming just about everyone here isn't a doctor. I just want to know if yall asked the same question. "could it be ADHD or am I just not trying hard enough (even though I am trying really freakin hard)"
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;I am so fed up with trying to get diagnosed. others who had a really difficult time, how did you end up following through?;;;I had my first screening with Kaiser Feb 9th. 4 weeks later I called because I hadn't heard anything, and they never received part of my paperwork. fine, I probably didn't put a stamp on it. they send me a new one and two weeks later I still haven't heard anything.   I am recently covered by my partner's insurance, so I go through their mental health site and phone line. They say "oh, your company provides 8 sessions of therapy. you have to use that before you use your health insurance." I tell them my goal is to get assessed for ADHD with subsequent therapy, and am referred to a psychologist.   First session with her was a therapy session. she said she will not diagnose or assess me, I have to go a different route if that's what I want. we'll see where we are in 8 weeks. (I strongly suspect she wants to keep me for the $175 she gets a session, but I digress)  go back to mental health insurance. tell them what I want and if I make an appointment with an MD, will it be covered? Yes. okay, great.   except no one is calling me back. the one guy who did call me back says he doesn't assess people, he only treats and that he would treat me once I have a diagnosis from another MD. I haven't heard from anyone else, or their information is incorrect on my insurance's website and they either don't practice anymore or moved out of area.   why is this such a difficult process?  TL;DR getting blocked everywhere and no one is calling me back to assess me for ADHD.

I'm a 22 year old female and I seemingly match all the symptoms of ADHD-inattentive. I was often accused of daydreaming throughout childhood at school, and left many lessons with only the date written. I struggled with all homework, passed with mediocre grades, and eventually failed University. My house is a mess, the thought of housework makes me sad, and my depression and anxiety are thriving on my inability to focus.  Anyway, I'd like to be properly diagnosed, but I'm worried about getting diagnosed over here. I still have to wait two more weeks to get properly registered at the doctors, then an ungodly amount of time before I can see a specialist (from what I've read.) The potential of finally being able to organise my life and maybe eventually go back to University sounds too amazing to be true. The wait sounds extremely stressful and upsetting. I've finally been able to quantify what may have been causing all these problems throughout my life, and waiting on it for so long just sounds like torture.  Anyone from the UK with Adult ADHD had positive, or not so, experiences? Please let me know your stories. Thank you!
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Was unsure about the first therapist I saw, had a scheduling issue with the second therapist and he's completely booked for another week. I feel like I can't deal with this on my own anymore and spend another week pacing in circles, what should I do?;;;I originally started seeing a therapist a few weeks ago, but decided to check out a new one because I thought he was too quick to assume I have ADHD after I described a few symptoms (I think it's overly/mis-diagnosed) and when I asked about his assessment process it was just a 66 part self-report questionnaire. Obviously if I came in because I'm well versed about ADHD and I think I have ADHD, some self-report is going to say I have ADHD. About a week ago I scheduled an appointment with a new therapist who seems more compatible with me, but there was a mixup with the scheduled time and the earliest he can see me again is in another week (the 25th).  I'm tired of trying to figure this out on my own and I feel like I can't wait another week just to tell the new therapist my symptoms and for him to go "Hmm, yeah sounds like you have issues. We better look more into that next week". I'm really tired of constantly second guessing whether or not I actually have ADHD and I start my first full time job as a software engineer on the 30th  and I'm really worried I'm not going to be able to function and end up getting fired since I struggled quite a bit at my previous internship. I want to buy a couple of books or something on ADHD, but because of my anxiety and hypochondriac nature I don't want to keep reading into it unless I'm sure I actually have it.  It's just really hard to tell because everyone thinks they have ADHD saying something like "I can't pay attention in class", but that's not my issue at all. I've been learning as much as I can about ADHD and at times it's creepy because it sounds like someone is literally describing me, but other times it doesn't sound like me (I generally don't have problems with inhibition). I've never had trouble paying attention in class because I really genuinely enjoy learning new things. For me I have trouble paying attention in conversations, I always space out and lose track of what people are saying which is okay with close friends, but makes it really difficult for me to contribute sometimes and can be embarassing with people I don't know well. I've had close friends describe me as a "space cadet" and a "zoner". I procrastinate horribly with literally everything, and not just homework. Whether it's getting my hair cut, finally reaching out to a psychologist, making food despite being super hungry, getting in the shower, etc. I feel like whatever mechanism makes you go from "I should do that!" and actually going off to do that is broken for me. I have tons of physical energy, all I do is pace around in circles all day while I ponder about stuff, but I have about 15mins-2hours of mental energy at most depending on the day and what I'm working on. When I was in elementary school teachers were concerned I "talked too much", which is really weird because I'm actually very introverted and shy nowadays. The most detrimental thing though, is that I can't finish any sort of project. I always start things and never finish them because I get bored and move onto a new interesting thing, or I just completely forget that I was working on it. I've been programming and playing guitar for 10 years, but I have yet to make an actually useful program or "song" longer than about 45 seconds. My fellow music friends tell me I make cool stuff and they don't understand why I don't turn my parts into full songs, but I just can't get myself to keep working on something for more than a day or two.  What should I do? I'm really concerned because I feel like I really need to get help before I start my job, but I don't like the idea of being medicated (amphetamines are serious business) unless I can be positive I've been correctly diagnosed.

I've consistently done horrible in many classes, only achieving A's or B's in a handful. A lot of my time has been catching up because I left High School when I was 15 (with a CHPC). I started attending at 25, after being discharged from the Army, so it had been a decade since I had attended any classroom (outside of military related classes).  I was diagnosed a couple of months ago with ADHD as a 28 y/o and prescribed a form of Adderall.  [This](http://i.imgur.com/mmfAonr.png) is my third (and last allowable) attempt at Calculus I (I have to take 3 semesters of it)  Aside from the school aspect, I finally feel like I can prioritize and my life no longer suffers from forgotten tasks (which were often important).

Once I was diagnosed I realized how I was different to everyone else and why I felt the way that I was. I'm a 21 year old virgin. Tough to live with, I've had plenty of chances with girls, I'm 6'4 not bad looking and pretty decent in convocations, the problem is i'm just so naturally lazy that I don't want to maintain a girlfriend, and sometimes I cant even be arsed to fuck. I would rather just go and chill out with friends or be by myself. I'm now finishing my 5th drink, bottle of whiskey, few beers and finally a glass of wine. I have a test tomorrow and I'm so depressed I don't give a fuck. Its an important test, I'm at university and I don't care about my grade. I'm trying my best to keep this short because I hate long posts.   I think the worst part of my life (which to be honest is pretty good, I have a lot of friends and my family are incredibly supportive) is that no-one understands me, at all. I feel completely alone on this planet and that burns me. It burns me every single day. Have I contemplated suicide? Yeah, but I think life can improve so I'm not going to go though with that. This post is sort of turning into a rant now. I take Dexamphetamine as medication but sometimes I don't like the effect it has, and the come down is pretty annoying, also I have no idea when its worn off... And these cunts that have no idea what its like living your life try and give you advice and it makes me so fucking angry, YOU have no idea what i'm going through how my day to day life is different to yours. Some days I feel like such a fucking retard. Recently its gotten bad, bad grades at uni, loneliness at my halls at uni because people are not very social where I live.   I know that I can be happy and successful but I feel like something is holding be back, right now I feel pathetic and useless. I just wish for a year I could go ADHD free and sort out my life and then go back to being my normal self and maintaining what I have. I feel like all I need is a GF, good grades and a social life and i'll be sorted. Such aspirations are out of reach.     I feel so lonely, so useless and so pathetic.   TLDR: Recently I've felt pretty down and I feel like i'm in a downward spiral of emptiness and despair and I won't be able to get anything I want. Fuck ADHD and everything that comes with it. I will find the demon that created such a condition and do unthinkable things to his body.    Please... tell me I'm not alone.

How can I stop?;;;So I got my diagnosis on Monday after undergoing neuropsych testing a few weeks ago. The psychologist who diagnosed me told me that while my test scores were all in the average to superior range the way I answered questions and the way I performed certain exercises screamed ADHD to her. Like the way I'd impulsively blurt out an answer then change it when I immediately realized I was wrong, the way I grouped things on a memory exercise, and how I sacrificed accuracy for speed on different exercises.     Anyway, while I feel ADHD is a really good explanation for a lot of things about my life (impulsive emotional reactions, constant careless mistakes, etc.) I'm full of self-doubt.     I'm doing an internship with a law firm that specializes in family law (which is what I really really really want to do) right now and a lot of it is very detail oriented work such as adoption paperwork and such and I just...keep making stupid mistakes that my supervisor has already spoken to me twice about (I'm two weeks in).     Are there any other lawyers/law students here who have had this experience/are having this experience? What, besides medication (which I will be starting soon) has helped?
d089fdc9bd3baac08ff94b7a7588075e58dd611c48026ac79996bc19da45fbf4;;;A bad psychologist experience (you are not add!);;;I am mid forties. I was diagnosed add maybe 15 years ago. I have a very intellectual job and I really struggle. I have had one of the worst years of my life (other stuff as well as the add/work stuff), and was recently not feeling I could go on.  My workplace offers a free psychologist. Figured it was free, had nothing to lose.   The personal stuff I have been going though recently is humiliating. I was very depressed with zero self esteem and was nervous about getting my whole story out to this guy.  He spent the first few minutes big noting himself. Then, very early on, he told me with complete surety "You do not have ADD" Evidently, my problems are because of Aspergers!  It seems that, as low as I was feeling, I just wasnT keeping up eye contact.So that was that. Aspergers.  Were you a loner as a kid? Yes. Aspergers!  I was a shy and anxious kid who would hyperfocus on hobbies and interests. I never had any fixations as he insisted I had. I never talked fixedly about my narrow interests as he assured me I would have.  My problems are evidently  just that I didn't fit in "You just don't fit in", Why? because Aspergers.   I have a small number of close friends. I am socially nervous and have a bad self image. But no, you don't fit in because you have Aspergers, like 25 percent of people who come to me. . Also, I am evidently stubborn, because Aspergers. Why am I stubborn? "Because you you were coaching me to say you had add. Clearly your psychiatrist diagnosed you because you coached her"  While he was talking to me a bird loudly crashed into the window.  I looked at the window when i heard the crash. "what was the second thing I just said?" I could repeat it. So clearly I did not have add or the bird would have distracted me and I would not have heard his simple English.  I just want to point out I think Aspergers people, in my experience, are pretty cool. I do not think they are known for there diplomacy, or are peopke 8thers turn to for advice when they have to deal subtly with difficult relationship and emotional issues. Maybe I am wrong!  Oh, and my son who I briefly described to him has Aspergers too! Yay.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;[rant] Parents' high expectations make me crazy;;;So I have a younger brother (I'm 17 and he's 15) who was diagnosed with ADD about 7 to 9 years ago and has been on medication ever since. My mother is also on the spectrum (apparently). I myself am currently in the testing process, so no definite diagnosis yet.  My parents have *always had higher expectations for me than for my little brother*, and instead of encouraging me to get there *it always shows by them criticizing me for everything I do*. I get an A on a test, they say it's great and then forgotten, I get a low C on another one I have to listen to their lecture about how I need to get my shit together and study more.  I have recently *finally had the courage to ask them exactly why* they keep pushing me to do oh so much (like threatening me with consequences if I don't clean my room, brother's room is worse and he's told nothing etc etc) but not my brother and *the reply was literally "we have already given up on your brother, but we still have hope for you"* (not really sure in regards to what, probably to get my life together?). When I asked why that has to be by pressuring me so much, *they basically said I shouldn't be complaining and that that was basically a compliment* so I should be happy about it.  The problem is, all this stuff they want me to do (clean, complete homework, study regularly, and so on) is incredibly hard for me to do. I mean, *I know what to do, I know how to do it, but I just can't*. Every time I try to clean my room, the first thing I pick up and distracts me. 5 hours and xyz activities later I suddenly remember I was supposed to clean! By then it's always too late. Same with everything else. I have the worst short term memory of anyone I know, and I have problems completing these tasks that are normal for everyone else.  *My parents know how I feel*, and they know I'm getting tested, and *they know my brother is very much capable to do all this* (he's old enough, mature enough, his meds work and he's proven to be capable before) as well, but *still I'm the one getting all the pressure* and he goes out everyday and does nothing.   The worst part is, *I don't think my mum knows that ADD goes beyond not being able to listen in class*, and outright calls me lazy. Additionally *she recently read an article about how every person is able to make the necessary changes in their life and able to concentrate and basically be 'normal' or 'regular' if only they had enough will power to make these changes*. She suggested I read the article as well because it was so 'enlightening'. I never finished it because a) I couldn't concentrate and b) *it was written somewhat rudely and basically invalidated problems caused by ADD*. (Wished my mum would watch Barkley's stuff, sadly she'd never watch anything in English)  *The problem isn't my lacking will power though*, I have it and *I push myself everyday*. At least in school. But after 7 to 10 hours of pushing myself, catching myself every 2 minutes that I am not listening, forcing myself to focus and still missing at least 2/3 of it all, *I am exhausted. So exhausted I can't just come home and keep on pushing to please my parents*. But whenever I try to bring it up, they just won't listen.  I wish they would stop asking so much from me, while claiming I should feel honored that they are. And they should finally see that my brother isn't worth 'giving up' on, just because some of his friends are shady and his life choices are questionable from time to time. *I feel like they are insulting both of us* at the same time. *In the end, he isn't suffering though*, because he doesn't forget the simplest things, he can listen in class, and when he had a stressful day at school there are no expectations waiting for him at home and he can just go out with friends.   **TL;DR My parents are having higher expectations of me than of my brother (he's on meds for ADD, I'm currently getting diagnosed) even though he has his life more together than I do. They go about it in a really negative way and don't really listen to me and my needs so they make me feel worse about myself (and having this condition) daily. I'm also not sure whether they think a 100% that ADD is valid.**  Sorry for ranting, I just had to finally get it off my chest to people who understand.

When you check me through the symptoms list I am ADHD.   Except I never told my psychs about my childhood.  I was brought into this world in violence. Ive had alcoholic father who abused mother when I was a baby. I was crying all the time she said. Then she moved me to live alone with grandma.  My grandma is quite of a hyperactive woman. Quite disciplined and energetic. Doesnt have much time to chit chat.  She was quite overbearing and dominant. I was having anxiety and flight or fight moments all the time since i feared her. A lot.  I lived in my head and played games a lot  In school I was quite afraid. Once again I feared children and was to quick to cry at slightest joke/remark. But I was praised as a little genius.   I lived in videogames/nerd world.   Then in high school I became more disinterested in school and I hyperfocused on playing guitar and music. I was playing in bands and had quite of a confidence. I never wqs disciplined and strict in playing it. Ive had my own methods of learning things. Out of the box, so to say. I finished high school with 4/5 as average grade, and I was studying night before the exam.   Now Im in uni and I fail hard. Even in concerta, my brain zones out and reading words seems like staring at picture.    I am by personality tests, ENTP.  I am also quick to anger person.    In my country its not ADHD, its hyperkinetic disorder. And psych, parent of my friend, said knowing me that there is no way since she is working with kids and teens and prescribes Concerta to them often.  But that I have PTSD, depression and tendency to self destruct myself via procrastination. That I need to go on AD's and psychotherapy.   I have no idea what to do anymore...   Somebody give me a hand.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;What should I do?;;;So, I know for a fact I have ADHD, Depression, Dyslexia, and some Anxiety . I have had them for as long as I could remember, but have never been diagnosed any of them. My brother was diagnosed when he was very little with adhd. I  am 20 yrs old and I have learned how to get by in education and how to cope through every day life. I have many symptoms of ADHD(to many to list) and have had 6 times of almost committing suicide, but only remember why I was feeling like that with  4 of em. I get periods of deep depression every few months. When reading I sometimes jumble up words like switching the spots for example: I like brown dogs. I would sometimes read it like: I like dogs brown. I also had no motivation to go to school throughout my whole k-12 and my grades showed that. My parents never  believed me and so they never got me tested. Now the whole problem is that I was going to get my self tested in 2013, but I have a wife and 1 yro daughter(now about to turn 3). I also was 18 and I had no money for college and was working 2 jobs and could not get state aid for college and my parents never saved. I had no other choice, but to go in the military. I owe my life to the military because it provides for my wife and daughter and the only people in my life that I care about. If it wasn't for my wife and daughter I would have already killed myself. But, it is becoming more and more unbareable dealing with all of my disabilities knowing that if I go to the doctor I would be able to finally retain information/learn! I have tried self medicating with nootropics and any natural supplement you can think of! And this is causing me to get depressed/desperate because I for 1 lied to be able to join the military, but at the same time I have been able to get through everything they through at me and be 2nd in my class, because I am doing this for the people I care about. And 2 that I would be able to get treatment, but most likely kicked out of the military and lose the only thing capable of supporting my family. What should I do? :(

I'm a college student, but I'm worried about failing out. I'm mostly a lurker on here because of social anxiety that makes even talking to people online difficult.   I have been diagnosed with ADHD-PI as well as some other LDs a few months ago and have started on Ritalin 10 mg x2 day. I am also taking Celexa after trying a few other SSRI's that made me suicidal/feel worse. I am also dealing with moderate-severe depression and ongoing anxiety that I've had since I was literally 4.  Because of these issues, I've turned to nicotine (smoking, now converted to vaping) to help me focus. I have no motivation because of my issues and my grades are absolutely horrendous. I am so tired of nothing working. Nicotine works in the short term, but my short term memory and working memory seem nonexistent most days.   Is there anything I can do to alleviate my issues besides trial and error with medication? I know I need to tackle one thing at a time, but I'm just so frustrated about my grades, social life...basically everything is in the trash. I have a hard time making friends because of anxiety, have a hard time keeping said friends because of depression (hard to even get out of bed) and I just can't concentrate on anything. I don't know who to turn to. Neither Celexa nor Ritalin seem to be helping me. I feel like I'm going to be stuck forever and never be successful.  TL;DR: Depressed, anxious with ADHD/some other LDs. Struggling in college academically and socially. My motivation is at -1 and nothing is working. What can I do?
380abb5fa4562ee49747653cec928e7ed85d3061e67e5132cd2034908188ddb6;;;How is your Handwriting?;;;It's been two years since I was diagnosed. As most of you probably have as well, mainly anxiety can be terrible. My doctor told me as a way to calm myself, to start writing out notes at work instead of typing them. I work in IT, so I'm always making to-do lists and so on.   My handwriting is also terrible. All my teachers growing up would complain. So by taking my time with it, It serves to calm myself, my handwriting is much better than it used to be (I guess practice makes perfect?), and with a physical list on my desk, it's easier for me to keep track of what needs to get done.  Overall, this practice has become one of the most important things I do everyday. And plus, I actually look forward to doing it now. This could be part of taking adderall though...?  Has anyone else received this advice before? Also, I wonder if the bad handwriting trait is part of ADHD. Who else has terrible, unreadable writing?  Thoughts?  Thanks guys!

I literally was a better driver when I drove stick vs automatic. I have an inkling its because I had to focus on listening and feeling the car, watched my rpms, etc. Having those things constantly going through the back of my head was just enough of a distraction that I was able to focus attention on actually driving my car. I still ran a couple red lights here and there, but remained accident free.   Was just wondering if other people had similar experiences.

What usually happens is that they work wonderfully for the first week and then turn me into a lethargic, depressed, and emotionless wreck afterwards. They generally makes everything worse including my ADHD symptoms.  I really want help dealing with it because at this point I feel utterly hopeless with life. I've gotten to the point where I no longer peruse goals because I know I'll never achieve them.

(Dexedrine);;;I've been diagnosed with ADHD several times in my life, but after developing an adderall addiction in high school and hitting rock bottom, I went into denial about the existence of ADHD.  I recently came to terms with the fact that ADHD is very real, and it's keeping me from being productive with my life. My doctor prescribed 10mg of Dexedrine IR and I've been taking it for 5 days now.  It's having undeniable positive effects on my life.  My apartment is clean for the first time in months and I'm able to control my eating and all the other unhealthy habits I've developed, but there's a problem.  I feel like a different person, and not in the jokey, metaphorical sense.  I feel like a ghost came along and took over my body, like "This is mine now, you go away."  I'm having more anxiety as well, but I feel like I'm in control of it.  It feels a lot like when I tried to go on Zoloft, and I quit after 2 days.  Has anyone else experienced anything like this, and did it go away with time?  Should I switch meds or stick it out?  I don't know which way is up right now, and I feel a little loopy.  Some important details:  I was a regular pot smoker, and I stopped after starting Dexedrine.   I also had depression, which I thought the Dexedrine might help with.  Right now I'm deciding whether I'll take today's dose or not.  I feel very dumb without it.  TLDR: The Dexedrine is having an antidepressant-like effect, and it's freaking me out.  Has anyone else experienced this?
baf3b2426b15276d7fea85c68c0387f0f4e759ffeaf77c9f75c62ad8f8ceac3a;;;Sometimes ADHD can be pretty funny...;;;I have been off Adderall since I conceived my son, and have been functioning fairly well considering, but had a funny little experience the other day. I stopped by my mom's and was hanging out with her as she was getting ready for a date. She mentioned how busy she was and that there were two mechanics coming over to look at the washing machine right before she was supposed to be leaving. As I was watching tv and eating leftovers with my mom, brother (who lives with her), and son, we heard the doorbell rang. On autopilot (kinda spaced out, you know how it is), I got up to answer the door. I opened the big entryway door and looked through the screen door at the two strangers in blue overalls standing there. I took my last bite of enchiladas, decided (apparently) that neither of the gentlemen were terribly attractive or interesting, and, curiosity sated, went to rinse out my bowl in the kitchen. When I got back to my mom and brother, they were looking at me expectantly. "Did you answer the door?" they asked. As the slight confusion on my face gave way to a look of realization at the absurdity of what I'd done, my brother just laughed ran to let them in. Thank goodness for understanding family! We've been giggling about it all day - having a girl answer the door and look you over as she eats Mexican food and then abruptly walking off without letting you in would be pretty strange!  Does anyone else have any weird and funny stories about the crazy hijinks their brains have gotten them into (or out of)? I can think of a ton of impulsive and unintentionally rude things that I've said or done that are hilarious after the shock has worn off, and I would love to hear everyone's experiences!
167c7d9f841455eff8a1fbe3802eda3b636eefa0e5a4704cb2ed54c8685031f4;;;ADHD and Grad School - any tips on revealing you have it?;;;Hi Redditors,  So I got my acceptance letter for grad school - and now that the shock that I got in is wearing off, my freakout begins :)  I have a few questions I hope folks can help with regarding education, accommodations and ADHD.  I was accepted into a MFA program for design and tech here on the east coast.  Well regarded school, fairly competitive (or so they say!), bit of an out of the ordinary program compared to traditional MFA arts programs.  **Background:**  I'm currently on meds and see a doctor, and have an official diagnosis.  I have a few days until I must put down my deposit confirming my spot for the fall - I'm leaning towards yes, although financially I'm terrified of how much debt I'm going to go into.  The other part that worries me is how well I'll do. My undergrad was good, but not great - 2.9, and to be honest, it was a struggle at times.  I was unmedicated, and no diagnosis of ADHD, and in a slightly different field than what I'm studying in grad school.  I'm hoping I got in because of my portfolio, recommendations, writing statement AND GPA, and that a higher GPA in some certificate courses I took after undergrad related to the grad school program all helped get me in to school.  (Yes, apologies for that sentence).   In my statement of purpose I didn't reveal the ADHD anywhere - just mentioned 'some initial struggles' as an undergrad.    **My questions:**  - **Disability services and speaking to profs:** I'm happy to sign up for disability services - I did as an undergrad for depression, which helped me get some extra funding which I used for tutors).  This is my main question - I'm concerned that revealing that you have ADHD will look to professors and perceptions about my ability, and even when to reveal your diagnosis.  I don't want it to be seen as an excuse, but ADHD has affected my performance in the past although I was unmediated while I was an undergrad.  I guess it's a question of 'do you reveal this before potential problems, or wait until there's a problem and then explain because of the ADHD if that explains it'?   If you went through the 'revealed it to professors', how and when did you do it?  It's a catch 22 - in some ways the ADHD does make life difficult and put me at a disadvantage and explain issues related focus and time management; on the other hand, I obviously want someone to understand that I'm not using it as an excuse, either, and will actively manage my condition.  I also don't know who I would reveal it to other students in my program. The hard part is that sometimes I do well with time management and focus, but when there are multiple stressors (health, job, housing) that's when my brain goes haywire, and I find that the ADHD really becomes noticeable.  - **Accommodations:** What accommodations, if any, did you receive from Disability Services, and how did you use them? I'm guessing it's more geared towards undergrads (note taking, longer test taking times, physical materials in tests etc.) but don't even know what accommodations would be available, and how that affects you and how you're seen.  - **Resources:** Are there any good books about ADHD and grad school, and how to prepare? I figure I can spend the summer mentally preparing me for an academic mindset, and any books or sites or threads I can read will help.  It's been over 15 years since I was in school, so it feels like I need help getting back into school mind compared to 'work world' mind.  I don't know if that's me or the ADHD, but resources would help me.  I also have some social anxiety, but a lot of it may just be the 'unknowns' of being in a classroom, what's expected, standards of performance etc.  - **Tips and advice:** I know it's up to me to be proactive on how I deal with ADHD and school and possible part time work, so any thoughts on tips and best practices would be wonderful - in particular how you get over fears you might have around succeeding  I've struggled in life, but getting into school finally feels like something I can be proud of, and really want to succeed at this next chapter, and know planning and ongoing management is one way to do it.  Any help is appreciated.  Thanks!

What now?;;;     So, before I start I want you to know that this is my first post on reddit.  I've read all the rules and stuff but if there is something I've missed please  tell me.   So earlier this weak I was diagnosed with ADHD, I had been diagnosed before when I was very young but ignored It until now. It didn't seem like much of an issue at the time but now that I'm 19 I've really seen my life around me crumbling due to the lack of focus and drive. My question is what should I expect now that I've been diagnosed?       Ill be getting a prescription hopefully on the 29th and I really hope it helps.  I'm really hoping that my meds will help me focus even a little, because as it is now I can't even watch 5 minute youtube videos or read a page of a book. Has anyone here had any really good results with meds? I'm terrified that they won't work and I'll be a waste of potential my whole life. I consider myself to be a relatively smart person (who doesn't) but if I cant ever focus on anything for more than two seconds I might as well be stupid. My biggest fear is that nothing will work and life will go on  with my potential being locked in a steel cage.  I hope I haven't broken any Reddit rules or anything with my post. And I hope this wasn't too choppy or hard to follow.

Basically Adult entrepreneur, who's life has been circling down the drain for almost 6+ years. Got Diagnosed, and have 30mg of Vyvanse a day, it only works if i basically starve myself, but no longer than 5 hours if i starve myself, if i eat normal i get 1 hour of focus.  It's such a bummer, feeling like a human being and able to focus for 1 hour, then you just feel WORSE then your old self, atleast your old self did 1 productive thing a day.   I get 40mg of Vyvanse on May 4th, which I can already tell you, wont be enough. And even if 50mg is enough, what happens after that tolerance builds up? I then have to switch to Ritalin, then Back to Vyvanse, then my tolerance is up, and i'm back to no meds, then what? I'm back to myself but possibly worse?   This is tortue, my life is spiraling down, and i get these small bits of "light", then im back into the dark. I do know that you have to build the tools, and i have been trying, I have an ADHD coach, and a Zen Mentor. Meditation helps with personal life, but so far not work. I really just want energy through out the day. I want my mind to just give me a chance to do something, anything.  TLDR: Just diagnosed after 30 years, business spiraling, don't think meds are a "long term" option. Just a temporary fix. And i basically need to accept this.

For some it can be downright addictive. Ubiquitous smart devices make checking in on facebook, reddit, or other distractions a habit that we physically carry with us. Multiple mental health professionals have suggested that I attempt to cut back or cut off my use of sites like reddit.  There's no denying that the internet can be a distraction. So, how do y'all think ADHD folks should handle it? I love the internet! I don't want to quit! But if I can train my brain to have better focus, it's definitely worth it. I'd love to hear what everyone thinks of the internet as it pertains to ADHD -- just another distraction? Addiction? Potential danger? Or not a big deal?

Problems obtaining a prescription for Erectile dysfunction medication.;;;(feel free to start at the sixth paragraph if you don't need background information.) I am 25 years old and I was diagnosed with ADHD last August.  Since I have been medicated I have done better in school than ever before and experienced a better social and work life.   I have tried Vyvanse, Wellbutrin, and Adderall for ADHD treatment.  Wellbutrin did not effectively treat my symptoms whereas Vyvanse and Adderall turned out to give me erectile dysfunction.  They don't decrease my libido, or interest in sex.  In fact my sex drive was ramped up,  I was enjoying my dating life more than ever.    The first few times I hooked up with someone on the medication I was very surprised that by the end of foreplay and making out, my pants came down to reveal a halfway erected penis!  Each time I was really into the girl and the making out.  I made sense of it after the fact by thinking "hmm..Maybe she was less attractive than I initially thought.." I found some humor in the idea as well. The second time, with a different girl, I reasoned afterwards that "she must not be a good biological match for me" or something. Soon after that I was reading about Adderall so  I could understand and describe exactly how it works and I stumbled onto the idea that erectile dysfunction is a potential side effect in some individuals.    I was headed to my hometown which is geographically far from where I live but I knew I was likely to hook up with a girl out there who I like a lot. I decided because it was over Christmas break, that I should stop taking Adderall because I didn't need it for school.  As I hypothesized, I had sex all night with really long lasting erections. I was relieved!  As I went back to school, I tried out Vyvanse and I noticed that It was still contributing to my erectile dysfunction so I went back onto Adderall because I liked it better.  Through masterbating I noticed that, it only takes about 24 hours, or even less for the medication to where off to the point in which I can have full fledged erections.  If I take Adderall in the evening, I won't wake up with a morning erection. If I take it in the morning, I will certainly wake up with one the next morning.   I researched clinical studies and scowered the internet for qualitative descriptions of individuals who took both Adderall and ED medication. I was not able to find any known drug interactions, and nobody reported a negative response to the combination of Adderall and ED meds. In fact, in the majority of cases I found, individuals said it solved their problem although a few said it was not effective.   My psychiatrist and my psychologist both agreed that this is indeed an issue for some people on Adderall and that after trying three medications for ADHD, that trying out ED Medication would be a logical next step.  Unfortunately my psychiatrist cannot prescribe ED Medication, likely for insurance reasons. She said an MD or a urologist needed to make out the prescription.  So I set up an appointment with an MD at a local health clinic.    After I arrive, they say they made a mistake and that the Doctor was not booked that day but I can see the nurse practitioner.  I explain my situation to the nurse and she replies with "That is what happens when your on speed"...I insisted that we needed to do something about it.  She says, "You can take your pic between speed or erectile dysfunction"  I was offended and I explain the social stigma that society so often attributes to ADHD, I go on to say that calling it speed implies that I am seeking street drugs for an illegitimate disorder and that furthermore I know that Erectile dysfunction medicine resolves this side effect in many cases.  She tells me that she won't prescribe me anything, and that I don't have ADHD.  She refused to schedule me for a follow up with an MD.  Instead she scheduled me for an appointment with there in house psychiatrist.  I tell her I already have a fantastic psychiatrist and that I only need to see an MD so I can get a prescription for ED medication.  She says that's not going to happen, because I "need a second opinion". I was so appalled I just canceled altogether.   I set up another appointment with a different doctor.  This doc enthusiastically tells me.  "Adderall does not cause erectile dysfunction, it makes your erections harder".  I actually found this to be really hilarious, it just caught me way off guard.   I began explaining my situation with the various medications I have tried and how I don't experience erectile dysfunction when I'm not on Stimulants for ADHD.  He says he doesn't believe me because "Adderall can give you four hour erections..." He says he has "20 patients on Adderall who complain of having erections that last too long"  I say "Wow, well, it doesn't effect everybody the same way.  It gives some people more frequent and longer erections, and it gives other people erectile dysfunction...apparently I fall into the latter example"  He says he doesn't believe me...so I explain how "all members of the amphetamine family, including Dextroamphetimine and I-Amphetamine stimulate the central nervous system, this can slows digestion, dilate pupils, and limit the blood flow to extremities, including the penis.  Even on 10 milagrams of amphetamine salt(Adderall XR or IR, I tried both and only at 10 milligram dosage).  I insist that it is causing my erectile dysfunction and I can pull up other examples on the internet if I need too".  I tell him I am going to look it up on my smartphone. I pull it up right away, he pulls a list up on his phone and reads off the side effects at the same time that I am reading the erectile disfunction side effect.  He chuckles and says "Headache, Dry Mouths...Oh, I don't see erectile disfunction" and starts laughing harder.  I am starting to get angry at this point, so he says "Drop your pants, lets see the size of those testicles"  Humorously (in retrospect anyway) I aggressively drop my pants to the ground showing my balls,  I gave him a gesture like "take a look at these!" He proceeds to fondle my ballsack.  We make eye contact and I ask "Whats the verdict"? He responds by saying "that's it".  I explain that "I can't just keep doing this, and how I have to choose between a sex life and jeaperdizing my academic and work life.  I just want some ED Meds!".  He refers me to a "Male health clinic" and assures me that "Adderall makes your erections stronger" on my way out he says "I'd love for you to prove me wrong" and chuckles.    I have to wait three more weeks until I am seen at the clinic. The last girl I experienced ED with has been hitting me up. I like her, but she took it so personally when I could not get it up. I explained to her that it was a side effect of my medication.  We had the problem two times and she always wants to have sex, and her feelings get hurt when I can't!. I have a lot of chemistry with some girls but I have been afraid to pursue them or go on a date with them. This has only been an issue since my last sexual encounter about 6 weeks ago.   My options are to quit taking the medication, I probably should not do this yet because I have a 20 page research paper, and a 15 page constitutional law paper due in about 2-3 weeks in addition to finals coming up. I also feel like my life is better on the medication, I have less problems procrastinating, focusing, and I don't ruminate about unimportant things that used to really bother me.   I could assemble a thought out paper, written in the most scholarly fashion as possible to addressing the concerns that E.D. is a side effect of Adderall and that ADHD is a real disorder.  I could explain the alternate treatments for ADHD before becoming medicated and I could describe my trial and error process in medication. (If you guys know scholarly sources on these issues as opposed to Wikipedia and online forums I would appreciate that. I found surprisingly little in my colleges library database.)   I could than present this paper to the physician who will be seeing me before my appointment at the "Male health clinic". Maybe for shits and giggles, I'll get a vasectomy while i'm there. The answering machine assures me, it's their specialty!  If that does not work I don't know what to do next. I have seen websites and read a few reviews on the service of "Canadian Pharmacies" that do not require a prescription.  Judging by the hundreds of reviews on some of them, this may be a viable alternative, although I'd prefer to go legit.  At this point I am really frustrated and I am confused as to why obtaining an ED pill prescription has been so difficult. If you guys have any ideas let me know.

I'm in the perfect position to get this done but I just don't. I really need to do something. I'm not even really feeling motivated to write this at the moment, so I'm half assing it but I'm hoping something will kick me in the ass. What's wrong with me? I'm 27 years old and the only job I've kept longer than six months is the one I have right now which lets me sit and watch Netflix all night while everyone is sleeping. I know I could better, but I don't.   I am starting to see it affect my relationship with my wife now too. I went on a rampage and had a full meltdown today because I couldn't find my glasses. I still haven't found them and now I have to go find another set. My wife hated me for the rest of the day and I can't say that I blame her. Now we have to go get new glasses tomorrow, and the only thing reason I am going is because she is pushing me to go.
24a8b622ff2aab8ff5bddf58e8073d93c56341355185bf78d8ebadfdbe733624;;;Hard time describing symptoms;;;So I was diagnosed a month ago but I wanted to double check the diagnosis because it was a very short interview. I'm planning on going to an adhd testing site of some sort in a month or so and wanted to know how do I describe my struggles and symptoms to a psychiatrist? Especially when I don't even remember my childhood all that well cuz of memory issues. **TLDR; How do I accurately portray my feelings without sounding like a drug seeker or breaking down and crying?** Thanks !!

I was diagnosed w/ADHD after a long struggle with depression/anxiety/etc. in my teenage years--was finally diagnosed my last year of high school (age 17) and have been on Concerta off and on ever since. I've always had lots of niche interests which got me access to various groups of friends; but I've never been great at maintaining those friendships despite very strong desires to do so.  I recently (3 months) started a new, exciting job in project management for a big and successful company--the team in my office is pretty small (9 people) and I'm having one hell of a time learning how to socially interact appropriately. I've been taken aside by my boss and scolded for interruption/sentence-finishing a couple of times and acting "too strong" in conversations; a coworker gently told me that I tend to "jump in" too much in conversations; and I've become sensitive to everyone clamming up once I join in the conversation at the lunch table (company policy is we all eat lunch together.)  I've managed to pare it down via reading about others' experiences and thinking critically about my own to a few key problems.   * When others share experiences, I immediately share at least one, if not 2-3 experiences that I or my friends/family have had that are (at least from my perspective) relevant. I grew up *really* socially isolated in a fairly emotionally abusive environment, and my absolute favorite thing is feeling like I can relate with other human beings. But, I'm learning that this isn't perceived as efforts of empathy, but conversational dominance.  * When I finish other's sentences, it's because I feel exuberant about connecting with them and I delight in being able to understand what they want to say. However, I've learned now that this is perceived as trying to silence or shut-down the other person, which makes me feel terrible because that's not at all what I'm endeavoring to do. * I want very much to connect with people, and share lots of what I think are interesting related tangents and stories; but I am coming to recognize that these aren't received well. I think it's mostly ADHD, but also having grown up in a very disempowering environment--so it's a desire of wanting to connect but also of yearning to be heard and valued. I get that this is my own shit and if I'm going to succeed as a Real Adult, I need to figure out how to ameliorate those anxieties and sometimes let the thoughts go unshared. * It's primarily an issue in group settings. One-on-one with people I am close to (like my partners and best friends,) I have been told to be very loving, empathetic, and thoughtful. All of this breaks down, though, in group situations where there is no inherent power dynamic (e.g., when I'm not a leader running a meeting;) or in individual conversations where I don't have a standing strong connection to my partner.  r/ADHD, how do you handle these urges/behaviors? How do you connect in non-emotionally-intimate conversations without dominating them by accident?  **tl;dr: I have ADHD and experienced an isolated, emotionally-invalidating upbringing. This manifests in conversations in behaviors that I think are efforts to connect and share with others, but are perceived by others as conversationally-dominating and self-centered. Do you have tactics or tricks that help you be quieter, a better listener, and actively empathetic without coming off as selfish or dominating?**

He asked me a number of questions and aside from not being hyperactive, I do all of the things he asked. My therapist on the other hand, still is trying to tell me that this is "all anxiety." I don't know how to convince him it is not. Anyone else have this problem? I have searched and read a number of posts in /r/adhd and haven't found exactly this scenario. Thanks for any support. I am frustrated and distracted.

I could focus, I felt my memory was better and got rid of the "fogging" effects my other meds caused and I started at a Community College where I have been maintaining a 3.7 GPA. I have state insurance so all the psychs I see only stay for 1 1/2-2 years and are usually just starting out/are young. My current psych has been pushing to take me off Adderall for the last year. When I ask if she thinks I'm "cured" she says no there isn't really a cure...OK. When I ask what I can do after I go off it to improve the symptoms it was controlling, she just said there isn't really anything I can do except for some unproven experimental things (like doing mental math daily, CBT etc.)...OK. She says it's not something that people stay on for more than a few years...OK, so why the fuck do they put us on it in the first place? I'm worried that my old symptoms will come back and I'll suddenly be stupid and forgetful. I can't put it off anymore and we will start reducing next month. Is there anything I can do to prepare? Will my cognitive ability decline? Or even be worse than before? What can I do after I'm completely off?
ae74b9346fbd35e1fd0d6347a75f1fdae5f72c607a22a4b1822b0e096fb4b417;;;I am fed up with the ignorance about ADHD.;;;Ok, so I was looking on the internet and I saw a video from a news program I usually like called theyoungturks, however, this video was of them saying that ADHD is "overdiagnosed" and that "anyone can be diagnosed" (hint, they can't). They also say that 1 in 5 high school boys are diagnosed with ADHD, nope, its about 5% of school age boys, obviously this video was misinformed and offensive to me and others with ADHD. So I posted a comment that said I like their program, but what they were saying was incorrect and was very offensive. Two people replied to this with some of the most ignorant bullshit I have ever seen.  From "Tony Montana"- (WOW, thats original, naming yourself after a movie character so you can feel like a badass even if you aren't!)  That comment is pure hate, it's very offensive. ADHD is a fake bullshit disorder, it's proven fake. The symptoms of ADHD are caused by high testosterone which guys had a lot of before our water was polluted with estrogen.﻿  I have no idea what this guy is talking about. ADHD and...testosterone? I googled this and found absolutely nothing on estrogen or testosterone. It makes no physiological sense that estrogen would cause ADHD... just... I have no idea what this guy is even saying. Then, there was mr.chemtrail!  willfixyourpcApr 6, 2015 Daaamn, you have ADHD?? oh snap son! guess what, all of those chemicals injected in you, all the fluoride, the chemtrails might have caused your ADHD...﻿  Uhh nope, ADHD is mostly genetic, you can't just "catch" ADHD. Also, I love the fact that he constantly says "chemical" as a sort of bad word when EVERYTHING IS MADE OF CHEMICALS.  I seriously do not want to live on this planet anymore. Does anyone have advice on how to avoid these people or just ignore them because no matter how hard I try I just can't. I know these are youtube comments and are not representative of actual public opinion, but I have met many people who believe this, such as the youngturks.

I wanted to create mine on something that hits home for me, so I chose ADHD. I was diagnosed 7 years ago and worked very hard to get through school with it, and I'm continuing the journey with it through college (Im sure you all know the struggle).   In my PSA I will be conveying what it feels like to take a test when you forget your meds. The point of the PSA is to educate people that ADD and ADHD are real conditions. I want to do this by placing them in someones shoes who has the condition by using POV shots and other film techniques.   Unfortunately I have come across many people who write of ADD/ADHD as fake excuses. I'd like this PSA to show people like this what it really feels like to live with the condition.  In the scene the student will sit down to take the test, but it will continuously cut to things that are distracting him. Examples: Shots of the clock ticking, fingers tapping, people biting on pencils. But I would also like there to be cuts to other things outside of the classroom (like quick flashbacks) that may be distracting him. Im looking for suggestions of things that you may often find yourself distracted by.   Finally the most important thing I need your help and opinions on is the PSA's tagline. The tagline goes at the end of the PSA and should be short but effective. My current idea is something like: "ADHD, Its Real, Its Common, Its Complicated". Let me know what you think and please give me any suggestions for any part of this PSA.   Also, if have a story about a time your ADHD/ADD effected your ability to focus on a test, please describe your story to me and how you felt. Use as much detail as you can so I can try to find a way to make the viewer feel what your describing.   Im asking a lot with this post, but I think its for something that could truly help our community. Please feel free to say as much or as little as you like! All suggestions help!

I had done my best to build up some walls that needed to be built, mainly regarding people who insult / use my family to put me down and how I deal with them. I had learned to just let these things pass and not give in to petty attempts to rile me up. But today, someone very close to me used my mother and her illnesses to try to make a point. Now I am not one to be easily angered, in fact I have problems getting angry at people and am naturally calm regardless of if someone is yelling at me and all up in my face. But I didn't have that calm reserve today when my girlfriend crossed that line. I know it is because I am so close to her and because I trust her with so much and I feel like this is a betrayal, which it honestly is. She knows that fucking around with saying stuff regarding my mother will cause me to lose my shit. She thinks that it was fair to say because I was talking about her mother in a negative sense. The truth is though, it doesn't fucking matter. None of it does. I am dating someone who has a mentally unstable mother who manipulates and lies to get what she wants, no matter the consequences. And today she decided to take out her anger regarding her mother and her threats / emotional abuse on me. And I won't take it. I am going to do something I rarely can do, and that is say no. I am standing up and drawing a line in the sand because I will not let myself be walked all over like she lets her mother walk all over her. I grew up letting myself be walked on, bullied, and taken advantage of. I let my heart and caring nature be abused by anyone who was nice enough to let me talk to them. And when i turned the corner a couple years ago I promised myself that I would change and I would start fighting for myself. And so I will.  It will probably cause more pain and grief than giving in would. It could even cause a large enough rift in my relationship to possibly end it. But I don't know what else I can do. I can either regress or move forward

dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Adderall XR 20mg daily - dose too low but doc followup isn't for another two weeks - what to do? (also went into detail about diagnosis if anyone's looking for that);;;**tl;dr got diagnosed by a sub at my new doctor's practice. 20mg of Adderall XR doing nothing for me after two weeks. What should i do/will my doc disregard the sub's diagnosis.**  I'm 33 and had ADHD as a kid but never treated. The hyperactivity left me in my teens but the attention stuff never caught up. Have always self managed (without drugs).  Moved to the US last year. About a month ago I did some research on good doctors in my area, and made an appointment with a doctor close to my job who had great reviews online. It's my first time going to a doctor in the US so I registered as a new patient.  The doc I wanted was booked up forever but there was a period when he would be on holiday that a sub would be there, and they had open appointments, so I scheduled for then (wait was around two weeks). When I go back in future I'll get my preferred guy as my regular GP.  I had a chat with the sub for around 15-20 minutes about my history (diagnosed as a kid but never treated - parents didn't want their kid on drugs), the issues I have (attention/distraction, memory, general fog), things I've done all my life to keep myself on track (keeping lists, scheduling tasks, learning by doing etc) and why I feel like I need to do something more (new job has a lot of learning around company practice/structure that I'm finding difficult, trying to learn new software/programming languages to keep up with my field and making literally no progress due to not being able to take in information).  I was prescribed 20mg of Adderall XR. He wrote the script for a generic, but my insurance refused the generic - luckily my deductible is only $15 so I got Adderall.   Initially it was great and I was getting a lot done at work, but after about eight to ten days I honestly don't notice the difference if I take it. I guess I'm slightly more alert than back before I was prescribed but definitely don't have the drive I had for the first week, and I'm back to getting distracted easily/losing half an hour on reddit without noticing.  Today I tried doubling the dosage and am back getting loads done. Energy, concentration, recall are all there. I have no doubt when I go to my doctor he'll up my dosage, but that's two weeks away and it feels a bit pointless taking a 20mg dose every day that does nothing for me.   What are my options? I'm new to the US hence I'm asking what must seem like a really dumb question. Would I be wrong to get in touch and ask him to up dosage? And having been prescribed by the sub, would my doctor be within his rights to just say "I know he gave you Adderall, but I'm not going to" and send me to a psychiatrist/psychologist to get diagnosed?
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Drinking tons of water;;;I take adderall xr. Is this normal? Like it gives you dry mouth, so I drink water. But I just feel like, im going through more water than i ever have before. By ever before, I guess im mostly referencing pre-medication, which I got a little over a month ago. I notice on the weekends when I don't take adderall, i dont drink as much water.. maybe 1L tops if i can even get there lol. Like i forget to drink it as well. It just sits there, etc. But on adderall, fuck that water aint gonna sit there, no way. I drink it.  Do stimulants make you drink more? Maybe its a psychological thing. Example, I read on here and online about how you gotta stay hydrated, drink water. So maybe somehow I just started doing it  Or sometimes on adderall I get a slight headache, minor, around temples or stuff. It goes away, or, I start drinking water, tons of it, then it kinda goes away totally.. Not sure if its becuase of the water or what  But im saying, so far today , ive drank 1.5L which is about 50 oz of water  So i can see myselef probably drinking another 500mL and thats usually where i top off.. 2L a day  today is no different. yesterday i did 2L, today is gonna be 2L too i can see it. 2L is 67 oz  Is this too much or what? I feel fine, just pee a lot at times  Pee is light yellow / clearish, so I reckon thats normal
c491bd37d2fa90f3a7b9938fa01bb4cac55afc5080fddd9ab9684004b54d39c2;;;Being treated like I'm trying to get a fix at the doctor;;;I am in my early 30's and was diagnosed as having ADHD and Major Depressive Disorder about 5 years ago. I was given a full evaluation such as the IQ test, the family history, the meetings over 3 months to discuss my daily life, the whole shebang. I was eventually put on 20mg of dextroamphetamine 3x a day (built up over time to see how I responded) and 300mg of Wellbutrin 1x a day by my then psychiatrist. This was at college so I'd have to get my prescriptions from my doctor when I was home.  Unfortunately my home doctor didn't like prescribing the dextroamphetamine because there is a drug problem in my area and I could tell that he didn't want to be doing it. He would always ask if it was "really necessary" and comment about how I wasn't currently working or in school. So I kind of just stopped asking for them from him because it was really stressful to have to explain myself each time as if I was a criminal.  Fast forward to today. No longer in school. I'm dealing with a shoulder injury that has already taken two surgeries and potentially will need another. I also struggle with increasing anxiety. I am now seeing a new doctor and he has sent me to a psychiatrist. I haven't taken any ADHD meds in the last year and a half or so, but have been on the wellbutrin the whole time, so I thought I would bring that up for discussion with the psych. He wanted to focus on the anxiety and the depression because he feels that's the "real" problem.  I had a bad reaction to the first anti-anxiety med he put me on so in my second meeting I again brought up that I feel like adhd is actually the larger problem in my life and that the anxiety and depression are exacerbated by my adhd symptoms. I did some research and found that vyvanse is also in tests to be used for major depressive disorder and might be a good fit. His response was "it's a stim. I could give anyone a stim and they would function better in their lives."  So again I feel like I'm having to beg for adhd medications, which also exacerbates my anxiety so I just don't. And then I feel defeated which exacerbates my depression... I just feel so stuck in my life because I can't focus on anything.  How do I get help for adhd without feeling like I have to defend myself at every turn?  tl;dr: Doctors think I'm just looking for a "stim" fix when I really just want to get my adhd under control.
9da47166659b90fd64d576221c30e8ccee3e90f98c3af8efbc15270b3cf26b34;;;An Update from last post.;;;So I wanted to update since my last post.  http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/320dkm/so_this_just_went_down/  So I have been working on getting a referral to Focus, M.D. only to be told,   "No, we don't want to do that right now, how bout you come in for an intake appointment. It seems you have been on and off your meds, and function fine, so come in so we can make sure you were diagnosed correctly."  Oh yes, absolutely, I must not have ADHD cause I do not get in trouble at work so nothing is really reportable as not "fine." Not to mention the fact I have been becoming more and more addicted to coffee now that I realize how much it helps me focus in leiu of stimulant medication. 4 cups in the A.M. and I can get my work done. Not hyper, not jumping out of my seat with excitment. Focused, getting work done.  It is getting annoying, but hey, I tried right? I mean hell, I have seen these people here and there, and none of the ones I have been told to talk to are ones I have seen before, so how do they know just how "fine" I am? I am so annoyed.  Sorry if this comes of ranty, but I really feel I can express my fustrations here more than I can elsewhere, and I like you guys. Fo' Sho. So thanks. :-) Yea.  Oh, and I got an extension on my school work, and have a 24 hour duty tonight. Totally borrowed the keurig from work to drink coffee all night and finish all my late work.  tl;dr: Update on Focus, M.D. referral, which got shot down, people here suck, say I am fine, and thank you guys for letting me rant about dumb stuff.

So, we are trying Strattera. Started with 25mg, I'm up to 80mg. Was a bit scared at first because of all the bad reviews but...   It does seem to be working actually. Feel more clarity, easier for me to concentrate on things. Actually I've not even been having to take klonopin because of this med (so maybe my anxiety was ADHD related all along...)   However a month and a half later, while it is helping, I'm still getting horrible dry mouth and stomach aches.   Few questions and TLDR... -If you are on or have taken Strattera, did it help your anxiety or is that in my head?  -How long did your symptoms last?
dcf026858563341584fddb292f9ae0eed1dd30ac0f78e17909bd1d1fb71fac4a;;;On Adderall, but plan on moving to UK this year. What difficulty will I have continuing medication there, or switching to something else covered by NHS?;;;tl;dr : Going to UK, probably can't get adderall, looking for suggestions/information on treatment in the uk and making continuing things as seamless as possible.  Currently, I am taking the following medication:  * Adderall xr 20mg  * Prozac 40mg   I understand that Adderall is nigh impossible to get prescribed/filed in the UK, so I am looking at potential alternatives. (Ritalin, Dexedrine)   As an alternative to a psychostimulant.  I was considering combining Wellbutrin with the Prozac. In the past I felt that it helped greatly with my motivation, though not as much with concentration. The downside is when I was taking it (only 300mg, no ssri). It tended to make me get much angrier when I did get angry.  I take prozac to deal with anxiety as well as making me far less temperamental/serene.  I heard that wellbutrin and prozac make a good combo, so i was wondering if i could go back to wellbutrin without dealing as much with it's side effects. I have also read that wellbutrin increases the amount of prozac in your bloodstream, so you might have to take less of it if combining.

Since I am starting graduate school in the fall, I decided to start taking stimulant medication after about five years of being medication-free. I see a psychiatrist who prescribes my medication and a psychologist who is helping me work through some issues related to depression. Recently I told my psychologist that I feel that I am able to stay alert and focused at work, but when I get home, because of a mixture of anxiety and depression, I am unable to focus on schoolwork and it is hurting my grades. She told me she doesn't think that my medication is working. This surprised me because this has always been my experience. I have a lot of issues with procrastination, self-motivation, and often have difficulties focusing when I am overwhelmed by the task at hand. Is medication really meant to combat this behavior? Because I always thought that was something I had to muscle through.   Any advice or first-hand experience would be helpful. All of the information online about it at present seems to be weird, fluffy bullshit geared toward stressed out parents.

It was Black Friday, we were closing up for the day, and I realize I can't find the key.  That magic key that opens up all the video game cases, the iPad case, and those magnetically locked hooks.  I tell my manager who surprisingly doesn't punch me in the face.  After about a half hour of searching, we give up.  If it were any other night we would have stayed as long as we needed, but the crew was worn out after the mega-shopping day.  Thankfully the next day a customer found the key and brought it to me.  Here's one I've never told anyone: last summer I was in Asia for a study abroad program.  I'm in the airport waiting to catch my flight home.  My travel buddy is asleep on a couch since we had decided to spend the night in the airport because of our super-early flights.  Suddenly I realize I don't know where my wallet is.  And in my wallet is my passport.  I totally panic trying not to wake up my friend for this humiliating scenario.  I'd been in this country for a month without a major screw-up, and now here I'm going to blow it all in the final hours.  I end up returning to the airport's convenience store where earlier I'd been struggling to use their printer to get some hard copies of travel documents from a USB thumb drive.  (You can get ANYTHING in a Taiwanese 7-11, they're amazing.)  The clerk recognized me and held up my wallet.  I literally knelt down and thanked him on one knee.  About three hours ago I realized I'd lost the keys to the workbench for a school project. I'm an engineering student and this project is a semester-long group project.  In a worst-case scenario this could have meant we went all weekend, at the end of the semester, without being able to work on our project.  Thankfully I'm friends with a student worker in the department who's going to be able to help out tomorrow, but I've had to admit to my teammates team that I dropped the ball.  **Edit:** Well it turned out after l all that I wasn't the one responsible.  One of my teammates had accidentally pocketed the keys and found them in his laundry yesterday.  I'm just going to leave this post here regardless. If nothing else it shows how as soon as something goes wrong, there's a good chance I'll find a way to think it's my fault.  I told a roommate after the keys had shown up, "If I had a better system in place, then I would have *known* it wasn't my fault."He said that was a load of BS and I was trying to take on the blame for something I didn't do.
6c3f6d7e93c1ae2c1d60f4cc8b2b408b1d141edabc25fb60589e2b9fdf418834;;;Certain I have ADHD. I will be undergoing testing through the health center at my university in a couple of weeks. Seeking advice/guidance;;;Hi guys,  I'm new to this subreddit. I'm mainly a lurker on Reddit, but I would like to seek some advice/guidance from this community.  A bit of background:  As a teenager, I was diagnosed with MDD (major depressive disorder) and GAD (generalized anxiety disorder). I have been on and off SSRIs, SNRIs, benzos/mood stabilizers throughout much of my adolescence and young adult life. I'm a 24-year old female.   Without divulging too many details, I had a very traumatic upbringing and have been diagnosed with PTSD. This past winter, I went through some major episodes of depression. I live in Michigan, so it's not uncommon for some people to go through the winter blues, or SAD (seasonal affective disorder).   When I was 3, my grandmother told my mom that I needed to be on Ritalin because of my hyperactivity and high levels of energy, but my mom refused to put me on any type of medication. I have never been diagnosed with ADHD, but now I am going to get tested for it since I exhibit many signs of it.   In recent months and weeks, I have been experiencing panic attacks, low motivation, lethargy, outbursts of irritation/anger at trivial things and I constantly experience racing thoughts and jump to conclusions.  My wonderful, patient and supportive boyfriend has been there for me through all of the turmoil this year. I am a graduate student seeking to get my Masters of Social Work and I'm the news editor for my campus' newspaper.  The panic attacks and anxiety I've been dealing with have been crippling and debilitating. I've missed work, class and internship due to them in recent months.   After talking with my mom and boyfriend, in addition to doing some research, it's becoming more and more evident that I may have ADHD. It would not surprise since my father (now deceased) had ADHD and self medicated. (Marijuana was only the substance that helped him. Unfortunately he turned to harder drugs that had a role in his untimely death). My twelve year old brother has also been diagnosed with ADHD. It seems there is a genetic component.   After talking with my boyfriend, who also happens to have ADHD and has received the proper treatment, we are both certain I have it as well.  These are the signs and symptoms I experience on a regular basis:  -Impulsivity, I want to act on something right away and I jump to conclusions. -Procrastination. I put too many things off until the very last minute. I tend to avoid them by hyper focusing on an entirely different task. -I get started on tasks, but have a difficult time finishing them. -I have very poor organizational skills. My desk at work and my bedroom is a mess. I've never been much of an organized person. -I'm forgetful and I tend to lose items (such as my phone, car keys, etc on a daily basis). -I experience difficulty paying attention to lectures in class or I have trouble focusing while reading a textbook and often have to go back and re-read a paragraph several times over before moving on.  -I tend to "blurt out" answers a lot and interrupt people without thinking about it at certain times.  -I have major issues with focusing on one thing at a time. My mind is constantly jumping from one thing to another.  -I overreact, I'm impatient and I'm prone to being defensive.  After visiting my psychiatrist and explaining the symptoms, she agrees that it would not be a surprise if I have ADHD. I will be undergoing extensive testing in early May from a psychologist to find out if I have it.  The antidepressants I've been taking have not been working. I was recently put on Klonopin (which does help with my anxiety) and I've been prescribed LeMICtal (25 mg) which is a mood stabilizer. I am also on Pristiq (50 mg) for the time being.   I also experience trouble sleeping at night because of racing thoughts and constant worries. I'm more likely to sleep during the day by taking naps after I get home from class/work/internship because I'm exhausted and unmotivated. I find that my worries from putting things off become depressive thoughts and I find ways to distract myself from them until I absolutely need to get them done.   I also have a hard time sitting still and I fidget/squirm a lot in my seat. I always feel like I have to be doing something and have trouble relaxing.   My boyfriend, who has a background in chemistry, biotechnology and pharmacy, feels I was improperly diagnosed with MDD. I think he may be right.   At this point in time, I can not say for sure that I do have ADHD since I have not been formally diagnosed, but I'm highly certain I have it and have had it, it has just gone untreated throughout the course of my life.   I apologize for the novel, just wanted to share some points so it makes sense.   What would you guys recommend I do for the time being until I undergo testing and get the results? What habits/rituals should I begin to ease the difficulties I've been dealing with lately and for much of my life?   Thank you for taking the time to read this. Any advice/suggestions are greatly appreciated. This seems like a very supportive and helpful community. I look forward to your feedback.   TL;DR - 24 year old female who may have ADHD. Has family history of ADHD and exhibits many of the signs and symptoms. May have been wrongly diagnosed with MDD. Will be undergoing testing through my university's psychiatric/psychological services in early May to find out if I have ADHD. Seeking advice and tips to help me stay on task with school, work and other aspects of my life.

I'd forget assignements and form due datesm, lose gloves etc but I'd always manage to struggle by somehow.   I was recently tested and diagnosed with ADHD-inattentive and I have been on Concerta 18mg for about a week now and I feel little effects if not any (Routine: I drink some coffee, study pretty consistently and then crash. This is normal).    So, essentially no change has been felt.  I have always had trouble with long-term memory (short term is awful as well). During family get-togethers my family would recall long-past events. I'd recall nothing for a lot of them, and if I did recall anything it would be foggy and I would have no sense of when the event took place - just the foggy memory with no timestamp. It's very sad knowing that good moments in my life have been lost to the tide of time and that there is no way to retreive them.  I couldn't find research that had a direct before/after meds with specific test-subject examples.  My Question:  Is there any hope for long-term memory improvements with Concerta or other medication? Retreval of past, forgotten memory improvements due to increased concentration on retreval process? Is there a start of a "mental timeline" once medication kicks in? Have your cognitive functions improved in any other ways?  For Example: "I took my medication last tuesday, before Tuesday was foggy but since then events have become a little more ordered and clearer. On Tuesday I did this..."  TL;DR Diagnosed with ADHD-inattentive , started taking 18mg of Concerta and feel very little. Saddened that long-term memories are foggy and out of place. I was wonding if anyone could share their experience about the difference in memory before and after their medication was working. Are the old memories clearer? Do you develop a mental-timeline of past events in your head after the medication starts working?   Thanks!
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Possible ADHD and dealing with parents.;;;Hi there, I want to start off by saying first that I am not currently diagnosed with ADHD. I am diagnosed with GAD and MDD.  Long, long story short my therapist and I think that I may have primarily inattentive ADHD. He's suggested that I speak to it with my psychiatrist on my next visit. That's all well and good.  Unfortunately I also have to deal with my parents. They're supportive and all, but I've always been fairly high functioning, so I don't know whether or not they'll agree with the possibility. They have a tendency to be quite vocal.   Assuming my psychiatrist agrees it's a possibility and everything else checks out we come to medication. My parents are pharmacists, and again, have a tendency to be vocal in their opinions.  What I'm basically afraid of is my mother or father deciding that I can't have ADHD based off of what they see, and causing a problem.  It would seem like it wouldn't be a real concern, but unfortunately it is. My mom has gone as far as to count the number of xanax I'd taken, because sins of the father, I guess.  *TL;DR: Parents are pharmacists. I hide the issues I do have with getting work done and procrastination by virtue of the fact I am high ability. Legitimately afraid of parents accusing me of just trying to get stimulants.*

It was raining very badly and we were going have to run about a mile through the rain to get to the venue, so I was, of course, distracted when we were getting out of the car. When am I ever NOT distracted? So, I grabbed my stuff and we jetted. Well, when we get back to the parking lot, I see my keys in the ignition and my car is still running! This was in downtown Houston, so I can't believe it didn't get stolen.

When i had too high dose of Concerta it ended up with me saying numbers from the last pattern, as if my mind was processing very "slow".  Whenever i didn't use my medication, my mind instead processed it too fast, thus i had to say them quicker than usual or i'd lose the numbers.

dfb2e90002205c86d0696b68b8a0f881392058443cc14534158c83dfd0a9e75f;;;ADHD-Pi concerta: In a few days it has managed to improve so many aspects of my life except for the one I care about the most, my ability to study.;;;This is my third day on Concerta 36mg(in a week 54mg) after being diagnosed with ADHD-Pi and since we're in the middle of national holiday, my doctor is not available to help me. I'll call her monday first thing in the morning but until then any advice to get me through the weekend would be appreciated.  From day 1 the Concerta changed my life. My head was clear, my body brimming with energy and I was ready to actually do stuff. I ended up "designing" and starting on the base for the vegetable garden I had wanted to make for years now. I completed it today, without any of the usual procrastination or clumsiness or daydreaming, and I am proud. My parents -jokingly- say I'm reborn. They exaggerate but it is true that my life is finally changing for the better.  Then there's the studying. I used to not be able to study because I simply couldn't concentrate and every fiber inside my money begged me to stop. Now, I can concentrate with a clear mind and no daydreaming. Still it feels wrong. I used to be able to read very fast -almost dancing over the pages-, but now I have to read every single word in every sentence slowly and patiently while my body wants nothing more than to expend my energy somewhere. It also feels as if time is now going substantionally slower than it used to while studying. As a result I now study longer and harder but far more slowly and with less enjoyment. This worries me since my college life was the #1 problem that led me to seek help.  Basically, I'd like to know whether this is normal and how I should deal with it or if this is a different problem entirely.  TL;DR: Got diagnosed. Got Concerta. My mind is clear and my body is brimming with energy. I can plan and do stuff without procrastination. BUT my reading has slowed down considerably and I somehow perceive time as going slower than it used to while I study. So my life is improving, but my college life is not and that was #1 for me. My exams are getting closer and I really wish the opposite had happened (that only studying would have improved instead)... What could this mean? Has anyone had this before?

c193235cc4a00b720a9333493155af7913a38d78815dd362be45fafea86c42da;;;Difference between Depression and ADHD;;;Hey!  So, I think most of us here have dealt with depression in our lives, whether chronic or not. The problem with diagnosis on attention disorder is that depression does cause inattentiveness. I hope this thread/post might clear it up for some stragglers who are wondering if they have ADD or just severe depression.   With ADHD our focus is very "selective"(who's doing the selecting? fuck if i know). We could play a game for 10 hours straight, yet we couldn't sit down and write a 5 page essay without getting up every 10 or so minutes. When I got depression, I found that my focus on the things I like (such as drawing, music, and the like) was on the same level as focusing on a research paper. I couldn't even sit down and read for more than 5 minutes when I was depressed. There was no more joy in my life, and I found my focus everywhere and yet nowhere at once.   That was my experience dealing with depression and ADHD. I welcome anyone to share their experience if they want to. I know that this shit gets extremely complicated from time to time, but knowing the difference really does help (especially if you are suddenly not able to concentrate on your work more than usual).
c0d25fa7f7badbb7d82aa5bc77a9dbc05c7161d9ce86d85cbf4b2560e2ad9edc;;;Have you been diagnosed with any comorbid disorders, and did you get it/them with the ADHD diagnosis, or later?;;;TL;DR: I'm wondering if others were diagnosed with any comorbid disorders at the same time as when they were diagnosed with ADHD, or did the other diagnoses come later? Or have you self-diagnosed the other stuff?  I'm certain that I have many of the other common comorbid disorders to ADHD (DSPD, SPD, OCD, RSD, dyspraxia), a past psychologist told me once that she thought I had OCD, and when I was being diagnosed the psychiatrist did ask some questions that seemed to be alluding to these disorders, but I only received the one diagnosis for ADHD, and he hasn't mentioned the others since.   I suspect that perhaps medical professionals would often recognise many comorbid disorders, but choose not to officially diagnose them and instead try to approach and treat them through the ADHD framework, as giving a person too many labels could be psychologically damaging to the patient.  I feel a bit frustrated by this though. I'd rather know the other disorders officially so I can, for example, read about the one sleep disorder, rather than becoming a mini expert on every sleep disorder known to man, just in case I'm missing something.

Both therapists and psychiatrist insists i am no such thing and ADHD is the root cause of the characteristic i identify to be "lazy".   The thing is though, after a year of Adderall+Wellbutrin i know now what it feels like to focus, and even still knowing i can no focus longer on things i never befrecould i get overwhelmed by this childish "I DONT WANNA" attitude. I feel doomed. Idk what to do.

I was never diagnosed, though. My parents seemed to shrug off all symptoms of the illness due to my dad having severe ADHD problems and not being diagnosed/treated. It has always been a running joke. "Oh, you're just like you father!" Therefore, proper treatment was never sought. I lost my insurance the day I turned 18, so I was unable to seek help for myself. After being uninsured for six years, I was finally able to qualify for a decent healthcare plan through my state. The first thing I did was make an appointment with a psychiatrist to try and tackle these issues with attention problems along with severe anxiety and depression. My question is: How were you officially diagnosed? My doctor did not tell me if I have ADHD or ADD. He didn't screen me. He did prescribe me adderall, however. I've only been taking it for a day, but it seems to be helping a little. Any feedback is much appreciated. Thanks!
895f0063349aeb3b23fb6a82dd526778eead170bf3c21718eafeb04d95a04ab5;;;Repeating what i've just read, or what others say- something that i've noticed.;;;Hello!  I'm pretty sure that many of us caught That moment, when we forget what we've just read, or just actively listened in e.g lecture and could'y repeat what we've heard. That is especially prevalent for adhd, having let's call it - low memory mode.  &amp;nbsp;  So i've started experimenting with repeating everything that i read, or i hear in the lecture in my own mind - it's in a way hearing myself saying those words again, in my mind, that were said by the lecturer.    Now with reading it's difficult to say, but personally uninteresting or more difficult to comprehend topics i could digest easier.  &amp;nbsp;   As for myself, i'm not sure why it works, but it ties with having a boost for short term memory, and then being able to actually digest and encode the information.   I've seen mention of simillar effects in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baddeley%27s_model_of_working_memory#Phonological_loop The model explaining that short-term memory and auditory processing are tied together, would love to hear any comments from those that know way more about it than me ^^    &amp;nbsp;  Easy way to test it, is to listen to a podcast just normally, and then listening by repeating everything you've heard (pause if you need to). And then try to remember what you've heard in section you did actively repeat, and the one you didn't and compare :P  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  It's only my personal experience, and would love to hear any similar experiences out of others.  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  TL:DR Repeating in your mind that, what you've just read, or what you've heard in say: lectures, may help you to comprehend the information, given that we have a low-memory mode, and we can't contain too much in it.

I am prescribed 30 mg vyvanse for every day and another 10 mg adderall if i have a lot of work (pre med student, my doctor was very generous).  Basically, i've taken vyvanse every day for many months straight. However, now that i've been off of it for 2 days, i understand i am psychologically "depressed". No, that does not mean i am feeling emotionally depressed. It is simply that i don't have this stimulant in my body any more, i have little to no energy - when i do take it, i'm able to go a full day of class and go to the gym for 1 hour a day. I can't even get myself to the gym these days. Vyvanse also suppresses my hunger (in a good way). Now, i feel like i'm always hungry and have definitely gained a few pounds over the last 3 days.   I know this is **NOT** the purpose for my 10 mg adderall, but I took it yesterday and as i predicted, it got my energy levels that i was able to have a reasonably good workout.   Do you redditors have any advise how to speed up the process of my body (neurologically) getting back to energy levels when i was taking vyvanse? Any tips and tricks if you suffer in a similar way? I wanted be off of it until i begin doing research back at school (~ 3 weeks) for no specific reason, but simply because i didn't feel it was necessary to be on focusing medicine when i have nothing to focus on

My doctor started me off on 5 mg adderall twice a day and after two weeks bumped it up to 20 mg XR (which is 10 mg twice a day as I understand). I've been on the 20 mg XR for a month now and I've noticed that the medication doesn't last the whole day, it last about 5 hours. I actually realized that from the beginning but listened to my dr and followed her instructions. I work 10 hours a day in a laboratory and my job relies on my ability to focus. When the medication is working it's been a complete God send, but after lunch I am back to my old self. How should I go about addressing these issues with my doctor? Is there another medication I should ask to try?

After getting diagnosed/medicated (and working my ass off) I achieved a 3.7 this semester and got my scholarship back!  Taking good notes saved my life. I attribute this to use of colored pens. It seems childish, but when I color coded important things in my notes it kept me engaged in the class, gave me better handwriting and I retained more information.  I just wanted to give a thank you to the community for your constant words of encouragement.  Good luck to everyone at university still finishing up their finals!
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;My brother has ADHD and I could use some advice.;;;Honestly, I don't know that much about ADHD. My brother is 26 (I am 23) and he was diagnosed with it when he was a kid. I can't remember a time when he wasn't taking one drug or another. We live together in an apartment and attend the same university.   Anywho, he's always had this thing where he is compulsively doing something with his hands. I assume it has something to do with his ADHD. In high-school he would always have a Rubik's Cube with him and be solving it when his hands were free. Later he abandoned that and would always have a deck of cards with him and be shuffling or otherwise fiddling with it. Neither of these things bothered me.  Sometime in the last year couple years, however, he abandoned the deck of cards and instead began twisting/touching his hair. He does this **constantly**. I am not exaggerating when I say that the *only time* when one or both of his hands are not fiddling with his hair is when both are preoccupied with something or - I assume - when he is sleeping.  I'll get to the point - this post is more about me than it is about him. I can't really pinpoint the how or the why, but I have a *visceral* reaction to the hair-touching. I feel the need to flinch and cringe away from it in the same why that I might cover my eyes from excessive gore in a film. If he is in the passenger seat of my car I have to drive with one eye shut because I can't stand that he never stops touching his hair. I can't have a conversation with him without flinching and averting my gaze because it bothers me so much. I can't watch movies or TV with him. I can barely stand to be in his presence anymore. It's like [Misophonia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misophonia) but with hair-touching instead of certain sounds.   It really bums me out, because I don't dislike my brother at all. I have considered whether this might be the manifestation of some deep-seated prejudice, but I really don't think it is. I've asked him to stop before, and sometimes he does...for about a minute. I don't push the matter because I can't think of a way to address it without causing offense.   Anywho, I guess if anyone has any ideas about what is going on here I'm looking for advice. I'm really not sure where else on reddit I could ask about this, seeing that it is at least tangentially related the ADHD. Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this and that it's so long. I've really never had such a visceral reaction to anything like this before and I'd like to get past it.   EDIT: It might also be helpful to know that my immediate and extended family are like a melting pot of mental disorders. I myself have thus far *only* had to deal with mild anxiety and depression.

I've found a few things like that for everyone 1 woman diagnosed there are 5 men, women are far more likely not to get diagnosed until adulthood (like myself).   But I'd really like to hear from some of the women on this subreddit on what they perceive to be the primary differences between female and male ADHD, how they are perceived by others, how they believe their symptoms manifest compared to our male counterparts, how it effects your relationships, do you think there is more or less stigma for women with ADHD?

Thats my second favourite movie sci-fi movie, my favourite being starwars.  I remember when I first saw starwars and we found out dv was lukes father :O I was so amazed. Or when dv killed the emperor aka space Hitler  Wasn't there that one doctor who episode with Hitler in it? That was the 11th doctor. He was a bit to fairytaleish for me.

Any tips on dealing with conflicting symptoms?;;;Bipolar and ADHD have a ton of similarities (to the point I've wondered if I have both but haven't been able to be evaluated for that yet), but there's also things that conflict a lot (like when I get manic and have to do a ton of tasks and have to get it done now now now and she gets distracted much more easily, which can cause conflict).  I guess what I'm hoping is maybe you guys have some experience with these things and can help with how I can cope with her symptoms without getting into the angry point of mania when having an episode. I know it's just how she is and this stuff can't really be helped (symptoms can be made less bad but aren't necessarily gonna go away), and I also know the same applies to me. What kind of ideas or thought processes can I use to try and make things smoother?  To clarify, this is the smoothest relationship I've had, to be honest (she's the only person I've been with that I seriously CAN'T seem to STAY mad at), and I adore her and love how sometimes she can understand some of my symptoms better than other people since she shares some of them. I just am a realist and realize there's always room for improvement in anything, including the best relationship I've ever had. I want to make sure this lasts as long as we feel it will by just having any tips anyone can give for how these two disorders intermingle.

Im a 21 year old female, thats undiagnosed with whatever I have.  Growing up I knew I didn't think like most kids. I read a book, listen to a conversation, have a conversation or even just thinking to myself, one word will jump out at me and my brain goes down a whole different trail. For example, if I'm listening to a teacher explain how to calculate the speed of a car depending on the time it took from point A to point B, my brain grabs the word car and I start thinking about how I need to wash my car and from there I think about if I should do it by hand or go somewhere to do it. And it goes on and on and on. That happens with every conversation I have or book I read.   Another thing that I've had a problem with since I was three years old is crying. 90% of the time when I start to cry I can't stop. Then I get frustrated that I can't stop crying so I cry even harder and I can never talk when I'm crying, no matter how hard I try. Sometimes I'll just randomly in the middle of a conversation (thankfully it happens only around family) start crying and the only words I can force out is "I have no idea why I'm crying". It pisses me off beyond belief.  My husband hates visiting my family with me because our conversations jump around so much, we don't even notice that we don't finish a topic of conversation before moving on to the next which results in me being at my families house for hours just talking...   I always have 20 different things I'm constantly thinking about at the same time. So my brain always feels full and I constantly feel stressed due to not being able to finish what I start. But then when I try to tell my husband why I feel stressed I can't give him the exact reasons why I feel that way because it's almost like I *forget*.   I dropped out of High School due to the frustration of taking tests and swearing that the teachers didn't teach half of what they put on the tests.  I always told my mom that I was different and I needed to talk to a doctor but she would get pissed and just say I was lazy and a " fizzler" and I don't take anything seriously.  One last thing is I don't remember my childhood. Nothing traumatic ever happened to me, my parents where typical parents. My mom was easy to anger but other than that, nothing bad has happened to me. I remember age 15 and up, anything below that age is extremely spotty.    When I call the Dr.s to make an appointment the receptionist asks what's it for,what do I say its for?  How do I start telling the Dr all of the shit thats different about me, that I didn't even know was different until I told my husband.  Sorry my shits so long. This is my first time telling someone thats not related to me, my "story"..

c3c5101e4189ae9c23ceb00ddd117eace76e797d7d038c52101622ccaba7ef25;;;My friends give me crap related to my symptoms, and I can't think of an effective way to make my point and ask them to stop.;;;We've been friends a long time, but I was only diagnosed/began treatment this year -- so they've been familiar with my behavior for some time, but it was never ADHD, it was just me.    Now that I've been diagnosed, I feel kinda sensitive about my associated faults, like I know what's wrong with me  and I don't need them throwing it in my face.  One of our friends is manic, and we don't give him shit for it, we care for his well being.  One is dyslexic, and sure we laugh when he mixes stuff up but if he ever sincerely asked me to stop, damn right I would.  But I don't feel like ADHD is that "real" to them, and my complaining about it may honestly egg them on.    So, how can I make a group of male-humor friends relate/understand/stfu effectively?
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Vyvanse high... I think;;;Well Oops, I accidentally took two 40mg capsules of Vyvanse within 10 mins... but I'm actually feeling really good. First some backstory, Im 14 years old, 5'10ish, 132 pounds, and a freshmen in high school.    You may ask, "How did you manage to take them within 10 mins of each other" in which my answer would be I don't know, lol. Probably because I'm a high school student stressing about the end of the year and I have the memory of a goldfish but... wait what am I talking about? JK, now back to the story.   I had 2 hours to start and finish an essay that had to be emailed to my teacher by midnight so I decided to take the pill (pills). Now I haven't taken vyvanse in a few months because: 1.) I didn't think i needed them, 2.) i didn't like the way they make me feel, and 3.) I didn't think it worked but mis padres convinced me to try (Oops, i forgot to mention i have ADD). But last night i was having a hard time focusing so i decided to take it. So within the first twenty mins i didn't feel a thing, which is normal, but thirty mins in i started to feel the effects. I cranked the essay out and went up to bed, but I couldn't fall asleep so i just got my laptop out and started watching netflix/youtube. As time went on i began to feel a little weird but i just took it as my body trying to tell me to go to sleep. So I tried falling asleep again but i couldn't so i went back on my laptop and started watching some cs:go videos (for those who don't know CS:GO is a competitive first person shooter game for the computer). As i surfed the web some more i got the urge to get better at the game so i went on a hardcore research stage and this continued for about 2 hours.  So now, 3 and 1/2 hours after i took the pills i started to feel really weird. At first i wanted to puke, my tongue was dry, and my jaw started to hurt because i was clinching it a lot (i also felt a little tingly, and my heart rate went up a bit). But about 10 mins after that felt the best i have ever felt before in my life. It wasn't like a 420 blazing dank memes feeling but more like a day at the spa kind of thing. I felt very motivated so i started to research the side effects of vyvance and things like that and it turns out that some of the stuff I'm feeling now is somewhat normal, but i also got scared because some of the stuff happening to me was under a "sign of overdose" thing and a "CONTACT DOCTER IMMEDIATELY" thing so i thought i was going to die... but i didn't so that's pretty cuuul.  Now about 6 hours later I'm still feeling the "normal" effects of the drug and I'm still more motivated to do stuff than i have ever have been before. It is roughly 4:38 AM and I haven't sleep all night. The feeling of being on a cloud, slowly passing through candy land is gone but I'm still not fully lucid and an not cognizant of everything. Actually, as I'm typing this the numbness in my finger and toe tips is coming back but it is as bad.   Now 4:45, i am still grinding my teeth/clinching my jaws and stilling feeling a little whack. I haven't yet experienced anything bad or a crash of any sort.   SO, DID I JUST EXPERIENCE A HIGH OR OVERDOSE ON VYVANSE AND IF SO, SHOULD I TELL MY PARENTS ABOUT THIS OR KEEP IT TO MYSELF.

Whenever I would miss a day in school everyone always talked about how quiet and nice it was when I wasn't there. I started to change to try to make people like me more and I was fine with it until recently. I'm almost 25 now and I feel like I'm wearing a mask almost all the time. I want to be myself but I really think everyone will hate me, and because of my past, that's seriously like the worst thing that could happen. I know it sounds ridiculous but that's what those kids so long ago did to me. I made a habit out of feeling stupid and annoying and now it's so hard to get my self worth back. How do I feel real again?

f9a11751e7fecc29a64d4ea758d84567a71ef3d48f1f614d3c804fc0e48316f8;;;ADHD and Empathy: We're not sociopaths;;;This is something that has been on my mind for a long time. I've been diagnosed ADHD since elementary school, and for a long time I used to think that my empathy was damaged. I wouldn't react to people emotionally like 'normal' people did. If someone was upset, I wouldn't get upset, but instead I would try to find the reason and solution. I used to think maybe I was a sociopath or something because of this, or that my emotions were simply broken.  But I realized that I do in fact emote, the problem is, my brain is always more focused on situations and tasks and it puts emotions on the backburner. When I do get the rare occasion where an emotion becomes the focus, my poor head doesn't know what to do with it. It doesn't just emote, it HYPER emotes. Anger becomes rage, happiness becomes extreme bouncing off the wall excitement, anxiousness floods in to full-on panic and anxiety... And those emotions can shut off instantly if my focus is needed on something else.  It scared me, honestly. I study psychology as a hobby and began looking in to it, and found there are three main types of empathy: Cognitive, Emotional, and Compassionate.  Now, at first, I believed what I had was cognitive empathy, meaning that one is aware of peoples' emotions but do not feel anything for or related them. This is a common sociopathic trait.  Emotional empathy is what makes people feel what other people are feeling, the more 'normal' form of it that we see.  But finally I found compassionate empathy, which is far more accurate to myself. It means that when someone is feeling something, I understand it, but it does not affect me emotionally. However, unlike cognitive empathy, I am looking for solutions. I shut my own emotions off with the intention to focus on the other person and help them, rather than connecting to them by being sad with them when I'm not personally sad for example.  I always just felt like feeling sad when other people are sad is kind of rude, because I'm not in their situation and they don't need more sad people around them making it worse.  I guess now what I'm wondering is this: Is this just me, or is this common for ADHD folks? What do you guys think? How is your empathy in comparison to other people?
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Please help. I'm grappling with something very difficult... I think you guys are the only ones who might understand.;;;I have ADHD. After learning a lot about this disorder I am extremely confident that my Father has it as well. He was diagnosed with ADHD in the 70's when he was in grade school, this combined with his actions as long as I've known him indicate that he probably really does have it. My whole life he hasn't been a very good parent. Luckily, we almost always had enough because my grandmother would give my father money etc if there was a chance that we could lose the roof over our heads or not have enough to eat. My father could never keep jobs, he was kicked out of the Army,he has several (if not dozens) of failed relationships, and my life was frequently uprooted as subject to his impulse. I see myself and my disorder in him and his actions. Because of his actions I eventually came to be raised from age 13-18 by his sister, my aunt. She was grew frustrated and resentful of me for things that I now realize are mostly caused by ADHD. After she kicked me out at 18 (we have thankfully since mended our relationship) I was eventually able to seek help and I've begun treatment for my ADHD. Over the years I have grown extremely resentful of my father's inaction as a parent and provider. However, I see that my father was largely failed by the society and system that he grew up in. After having so many people give up on him I feel that at some point he gave up on himself. **I can't say I would've faired any differently in his situation** This disorder severely impaired his chance at a happy, successful life. I just don't know how to approach him regarding all of this. Do I try to reconcile with him? Can I help change his self stated and outwardly expressed belief that he isn't a good person? I fucking hate this disorder.

None of my math or physics grades showed improvement on the final despite the fact I felt I tested better. I did okay in english I think and I do have one 4.0 but its only 3 credits. And its not a prequisite so my department doesn't see it anyways.   * I know I studied poorly. I started working the week before finals and never called the person I was supposed to see for CBT. I had no idea if I was going to be in town long enough for CBT until I could get a job, but I still never called. I tried my hardest at the end and did the best with what time I had available, but effort means fuck all since it should have started earlier, and my meds didn't really help anyways.   * I am so ashamed I don't think I can tell my parents. They gave me one more chance this quarter to raise my grades or they would cut off financial support and this quarter would be a loan. I"m going home for a vacation with them in a week and I don't think I can do it. I'm so ashamed and I know they'll make sure I know how disappointed they are  * They don't really believe I have ADHD. They've spent several years now trying to stop me from seeking diagnosis or treatment and got really mad at me over break when I brought it up again. I kept badgering but it took weeks before they came to my side and by then it was late in the quarter.  * I don't think I really have ADHD. I'm still fairly sure my Dad was right and I'm just lazy and unmotivated, but I have something else going on that looks like ADHD. I jsut think I structured my answers and thoughts around my ARNP to get the medication and easy way out. I should have listened to my parents all those years.   * I even had a rather expensive one-on-one tutor this quarter but it didn't matter. Parents paid for that too. More wasted money. More evidence I'm just dumb or bad.    * Now I have to take out loans, but I don't think I'm going to. I don't see the point in school. I want to go into engineering but I'm only good at the hands-on stuff or whatever I hyperfocus on for the week. The research project was just a fluke because I managed to hyperfocus on a relevant topic  * I actually really enjoy all my classes. This just makes it hurt more when I fail. It also makes it clear that something else is wrong, or I'm just dumb.   * I don't think I belong in academics. I don't think I have ADHD. And no matter what, I've disappointed everyone and myself again. The state I was in for the majority of the quarter is no excuse. I was just looking for an easy out. Plus I now owe my parents whatever this quarter cost them as a loan, since that was the deal if I failed or didn't improve. I had half a mind to take a summer math+physics course to make a potentially bad gpa up, but I'd miss the first week and I can't afford it with my job and my newly acquired debt.   * I thought between actually starting CBT this summer and continuing medication that next year was all mine, but I don't think so anymore. I have no motivation and I just feel completely apathetic. I'm not suicidal, but I just don't care anymore. Not even anxious or sad, just stunned. I can't bear to tell my parents. I don't deserve their attention, money, or support.   * I'll never get into my major now since I'm even more than 1.5 grade points below the average admission gpa, and its obvious I'm not meant for that anyways. So cross another thing off the lifetime achievement goals, I should stop expecting my legacy of disappointment to change. Theres no point even going in debt if I can't get a degree in a major that would get me a job.   * I didn't get the grades my parents and I wanted in highschool, I didn't get into my dream college, and now I can't even do well in the one I'm in. Combine that with the fact that I didn't do well in sports in HS (disappointing dad's legacy), didn't socialize much or very well (or party, more disappointment), haven't been in a serious relationship, and the fact I think I'm not entirely straight (guess what my family doesn't like?) and I couldn't disappoint them more. Esp. my dad.   tl:dr I fucked up and its all my fault, and despite the medication making me feel better and having a diagnosis, I think its wrong and I was just showing the common normal response to stimulants. I'm going to have to go into debt, but have no chances of getting into a major with career prospects with my GPA at my current uni unless I can somehow entirely reset the past. I don't think I can talk to my parents or look them in the eyes ever again, I just wasted nearly $25,000 of my fathers money. His income level being high doesn't diminish it or make it any more okay at all, either.

I've been happy and sad and everything in between.  Like many ADHDer's I get overwhelmed by negative emotions and have trouble pushing through and need a way to 'cool off' and reset.  &amp;nbsp;  But even from a young age I've often felt emotionally detached.  &amp;nbsp;  I can sometimes really be charismatic and enjoyable to be around, but the majority of the time I'm a robot.  I was actually first mis-diagnosed with Aspergers.  &amp;nbsp;  According to my family, when I was very young, I had one stuffed animal that I would always have around with me.  However, I lost it somewhere and never saw it again.  Not once did I cry, or even acknowledge that it was missing.  It's as if I just forgot that I even had an emotional attachment to that soft and comforting toy animal.  PS: I'm somewhere between ADHD inattentive and combined subtypes.  Probably relevant.

I have a therapist that i kind of enjoy talking to and a separate nurse practitioner that i talk to about meds.  the NP started me on citalopram on the first day (my questionare showed major depression)   my question is this: is having 2 separate (non phd) people to talk to a good thing?  i feel like it could cause problems with getting an accurate diagnosis for a few reasons.  1, they arent in the room with me at the same time, so they both get two different versions of the story.  2 because one is focused on the envirnment side and one is focused on the meds side, with separate appointments on different days, i talk to them about different things, so im worried about not getting the right medications.  3 because i talk to them about different things, im not sure how much they communicate with each other about me specifically, other than the notes my therapist takes, which the NP then has to interpret in her own way (and vice versa), so im worried about errors in the diagnosis. i do have several other concerns, but is this approach normal?  did you guys go through this? where you have to talk to two different people or am i better off trying to find an actual psychiatrist? where i only have to communicate with a single person.  a single person would be able to combine all of what i would talk about into a cohesive diagnosis, at least thats my thought.  what do?

I had one appointement so far. At first it was ok, but telling embarrassing stuff about myself quickly drained me out. I tried to add a little bit of humor to make it less overwhelming, but I think it was a bad idea, because the absence of reaction from the psychiatrist made me feel even more uncomfortable. In the end, I was making lapsuses, having blanks, being inprecise, talking like a 5 yo... I felt very ridiculous, and when she said "ok we're done" and left her office without saying goodbye, I felt totally worthless. I know, I have a very low self esteem.  I have another appointement in a few days. It's going to be another interview, and it's going to be around 3 times as long as last time. I don't know how I'm going to make it, if I zone out or go blank again after just a few minutes... It's going to be horrifying. I gave her some written stuff about me last time to counter this risk but she'd rather not use it.  TLDR; How do you handle telling embarrassing stuff about yourself during long diagnosis appointements? I quickly zone out and start being nervous and imprecise.

Context in post.;;;Edit to update: Thank you. You all helped me stay calm(ish) through the worst of it; my doctor thinks it's mostly withdrawal symptoms from discontinuing lexapro too quickly. The cats have come out of hiding and I can hug my husband again so things are getting better. I'd been looking forward to being done with my old meds but that will just have to wait a few more weeks. Again, thank you!  Original post: Normally I can just acknowledge irritating things or frustration and move on but today it just keeps growing and won't go away. The only way I've found to keep together is by curling up in a quiet spot, sobbing it out, and trying to nap. From the moment I woke up it's been like this: I see something and it isn't perfect or convenient and I try to fix it but the fact of imperfection irritates me and pretty soon I'm slamming things, cursing, scratching my arms red, bashing my head with books or hands or walls, and the cats have run off under the furniture. This is all very, very unusual for me, I haven't been like this since high school over 10 years ago. Right now I can't go outside without looking sleeves or the word "fuck" and lots of red scratch lines will be visible. Self-harm is also very, very unusual for me.  I'm in the process of starting ADHD meds but because of prior depression my doctor and I are tapering off those (Wellbutrin &amp; lexapro) first. It's almost done and the only noticeable side effects have been persistent headaches, feeling cold, and falling asleep much faster than usual.  Has anyone else experienced this, or something like it? Even if you haven't quite been where I am would you please share how adjusting meds and resetting your personal normal has been? I'll be bringing this up to my Dr tomorrow but in the meantime I'm feeling confused and lonely.  TL;DR I'm diagnosed with ADHD &amp; in the process of weaning off antidepressants. I'm feeling extremely irritable &amp; uncontrolled, scratching myself, throwing things, hitting myself with books until the covers bend. Then I'll curl up in a sobbing ball. Wtf? Have appointment with psych. tomorrow.

I've been a lurker here for months, and am curious if any of you share my experience with ADHD and adderall, particularly the weirdness of rebuilding your life as a 'mature adult.' At the very least, I hope my story can help anyone out there who's still struggling.  Like many of you, I covered my ADHD symptoms with bad habits. My family didn't believe in mental health and emphasized academics as the highest priority, an attitude that both saved and sunk me later. School wasn't too bad at first, but I really bit the dust in college. 3 years into a pre-med program at a rigorous university, I thought I'd hit the rock bottom of mental health: anxiety, depression, and eating issues.   Unfortunately, it only got worse for the next 2 years. Funnily, I could do everything required for med school during college, and got an almost perfect college GPA. It was easy to keep going in school, because I thought college would end and I'd take a relaxing year working a full-time job. That's when all the anxiety and fear I'd used for years to make myself focus hit me big-time. Now, the experience seems pretty surreal: I'd write half an email at work, start two more concurrently, then start a fourth and totally forget about the first 3 within 15 minutes. Outside my job, my brain buzzed 24/7 with negative thoughts--I was stupid, inadequate, ugly, unmotivated, you name it. So, around January I decided enough was enough and made an appointment with a psychiatrist.   This doctor and his diagnosis changed my life.   He prescribed adderall during my first visit. From the first pill I took, Adderall gave me peace of mind. The negative thoughts shut up. My anxiety vanished (*note, this effect faded somewhat later on), my achievements finally made me happy and confident, and for the first time in 10 years my eating issues were simply gone. I could actually go OUTSIDE my head, and interact easily with the world! 5 months later, I'm in love with life and will happily be attending medical school in the fall. :)  What I love most, now, is how easily I can go from thinking--&gt;acting. If I want to run, I run. If I want to cycle, dance, read, work, I can DO it. I'd been forcing myself to train for marathons previously, but every moment of physical effort was exhausting both mentally and physically. Now, I can actually enjoy exercise! It's relaxing, not painful. Running, cycling, and jogging with my dog outdoors are some of my favorite activities.   A caveat, though: this wholesome state fades when the drug wears off. For ex, before I began taking adderall, a flight of stairs was excruciating unless I hyperfocused on overcoming them (this happened even after a regimen of almost daily exercise, including rowing, running, tennis, and lifting!). Talking to people without adderall also drains my energy. Luckily, I was already improving my social life before adderall, so except the energy difference and focus I'm pretty okay.   ***Anyway, sorry for the monologue!! My question is: does anybody else have absolutely NO energy without adderall (prior to ADHD diagnosis in particular)? And does adderall let you get out of your head? If so, what can you do to get around this when you aren't taking adderall?***  Tl;dr, I was diagnosed with ADHD and anxiety after struggling with no focus, low energy, anxiety, depression, and eating issues for 10 years. Adderall cured all the above within 5 months, and transformed me from a depressed couch potato to an active, social, confident person. My life is awesome, but I'm concerned that I I 'naturally' seem to have no energy prior to my diagno(e)s. Has anybody also experienced this?
209cb69420fcd953924ad5fe58a92a7f2cda61b8c9d99f49e61924bcc749d2a5;;;After 6 years of agony in college, I landed a volunteer internship at a place I thought I could never work for.....I got fired today after a month and a half on the job. Does this shit stop?;;;I apologize and thank you in advance for the incoming rant because I need someone to wallow in my self pity with me:  I spent 6 years getting fucked by my engineering courses. My grades were so low, I got kicked out once and was put on probation for most of my collegiate career.   I felt like the biggest dumbass in every one of my classes. I ended up hating engineering.  What's more is that I spent the past 6 years with only a handful of friends, what I would consider mostly close acquaintances. Almost every person I considered a 'close friend' in both high school and college is barely in touch with me.  I read the journal article that was posted the other day, and it mentioned that ADHD people have trouble keeping friendships. That's me right there.   And, as predicted, I was diagnosed with ADHD during the summer of my fifth year,   I was put on medication. My life got slightly better, things seemed like they were looking brighter. I was visiting a therapist, my grades were improving, and I was going to graduate.   I even made a friend I really liked.  But my social anxiety had become so severe that I ended up becoming infatuated with her as a friend and then, inevitably, as a romantic interest because she was the only person I hung out with for a couple of months and the first girl I had been with in a long time.   Problem was she had a boyfriend. She probably noticed that I liked her and was acting weird around her so she distanced herself from me and now I don't even have her as a friend.  So my final semester comes by and while I'm doing slightly better in school, my social life has taken a step back because I've lost my only friend at this point and my anxieties have kicked into high gear.   I graduated finally in May. I wasn't proud, really. I had a shit GPA, no job prospects, no friends, no sex, no career aspirations because I hated my own field.  But then, this summer, I landed an internship at a news organization that I thought could provide a pathway into journalism, something I truly enjoyed. It was a volunteer position, but shit man, I thought I was incredibly lucky to even work for such a place.   Today, I got an email from my editor saying I've been taken off the team: I made too many mistakes.   For some reason, I'm barely fazed. Sure, I cried and I feel sad now. But I'll get over it tomorrow. For 6 years I got dejection after dejection for every failed grade in my exams. I mastered the art of getting over failures.   But for once, I want that A. I want some satisfaction and some success, and I don't want to be the biggest loser in the room, at least not in every fucking building.   Most of all, I want some support. I feel alone as fuck right now. Bless my therapist, I trust her, but I have no idea if my visits with her have been helping me.   I take one step forward and two steps back every month. I've been trying so hard to improve myself but if my life were an ice cream cone, it seems like for every scoop of vanilla I get two scoops of cow shit.  I can't help but feel like I have been robbed of my personality. What was once a fun, weird kid with ADHD who would get along with everybody has been beaten down into a bitter, traumatized man with a co morbidity of depression, anxiety, and ADHD.  I thank the heavens I don't have suicidal thoughts. But if I am satisfied with my life for an extended period of time at any point in the future, i will have considered myself the strongest man of my generation.  I don't live in a warzone, I have parents who love me, and grew up with food in my belly and some toys. My own problems are bullshit compared to Malala's or a starving sub-Saharan child. But at the same time, life feels like a step above hell right now.
19e8286bf1fa0daa555dbfa8e683374d67000400cb5c5aa3f6d0b40dad5d0650;;;So I'm seeing a doctor about this next Monday...;;;My partner has several mental health issues (mostly anxiety/PTSD-related). She had been suffering from intense insomnia lately and decided to see a doctor to see if they could suggest something different, new meds, a referral to a specialist, sleeping pills or whatever. And I'm like, awesome. Happy wife, happy life, right? And she can hardly be happy without any sleep whatsoever.  She texts me a little later in the day saying "The doc gave me a referral to a psychiatrist to review my situation. He thinks I might have ADHD and some OCD, but I'm not seeing it. I mean, I know my issues are mostly PTSD-driven."  Being the caring husband that I am, I figure that Oh, I'll just learn everything there is to know on ADHD, you know, to be helpful. And oh my God it explains most of the weird behaviours and coping mechanisms I've had in the rest of my life.  I lose track of conversations because I can't decide what part of someone's face I have to look at when I'm talking to them. When I get overwhelmed, I send my hand into very specific, twisted motions to split my focus and tone down the world around me. I get extremely irritable around crowds. I do things until I hit that wall of difficulty and then drop the project completely (tried learning to code, started to design about 35 different tabletop RPGs, I have 6-7 blogs with 1-2 posts around the Web. The list goes on). I can't get any work done without my vision going out of focus, unless I have noise cancelling headphones and am playing loud, lyricless music. Generally Downtempo or instrumental hip-hop. Well, nu-jazz is pretty sweet too. Anyways.  A few weeks ago, I was trying to help my better half set up a backsplash (with wallpaper+Mod Podge+a sealant, it looks great), and I got so angry about the creases in the paper I couldn't stop myself from bashing my head into the cupboard. We then came to the conclusion that I needed to calm the hell down, maybe go play complicated videogames for a while.  Last week, I thought I was a lazy waste of potential. A smart young man screwed over because he was just smart enough to coast but not smart enough to actually succeed. Or maybe everyone was like me and I kept running into super motivated overachievers.  Now I'm realizing I might have a problem. And problems have solutions, which is probably my favorite feature of problems. I'm seeing a doctor about a referral to a shrink on Monday. I'm feeling relieved and a little ashamed? Probably because of an early-life of being told ADHD was an imaginary illness and really, "I'd just send my kid run a couple of laps around the block after dinner".   I have a reasonably safe government job right now. That I might hate. The problem might also be elsewhere. I don't think I'm keeping it passed September unless something changes. I don't know if I'm happy or terrified at the prospect (I'm not fond of the job) but I'd rather get to a place where I can leave on my term.  So yeah, thanks to the internet for telling me about your experiences and prompting me to get help. I might actually end up a human being after all (as opposed to a raging ball of frustration at my own inability to actually do things).  After a few conversations with my partner, she came to three conclusions.  1- I shouldn't self-diagnose. I do not have the training, nor the experience to tell such things. And the internet isn't a doctor.  2- I definitely have ADHD. No doubt about it. Oh yeah.  3- I am not a failure or a piece of human waste for admitting to weakness and needing help.  I'll keep you guys posted.   TLDR: Internet and wife is making me seek help. Thanks internet (and, to a much greater extent, wife)!

I am a graduate student and only have the ability to get on campus health insurance, so an outside provider isn't an option.  What they have made me do:   1. Prove I had a diagnosis from an outside hospital.    2. Filled out a questionnaire, which was targeted to be used as a psudeo-diagnosis.  It asked questions like between the ages of 5 and 12 did you have trouble following instructions, ect.   3. They are going to mail that same questionare to my mother and have her fill it out. It could be anyone from your childhood, but they had to know you then.   4. The nurse told me I had to get a drug test, which I was fine with even though I had to pay for it out of pocket because it was a third party. I wasn't okay with it being  **an observed drug test**. I will get into how this made me feel in a little bit.   5. Meet with a doctor and go over this stuff. (I have this appointment Friday)   6. Get meds? It is really unclear to me when that will happen   I just really am curious as to what other universities do because I feel like this is an undue burden to care and an invasion of my privacy in the name of preventing abuse of adderol by students.  **It wasn't a nurse that was in the room with me**, it was some person who worked at this troubled youth and family center the test was at.  My last university didn't make me do this, and I was just getting diagnosed then. I have been diagnosed for a number of years now, and I figured this would be easy because I'm not just trying now to get diagnosed. This still wouldn't be okay even if I was a new diagnosis.  **TL;DR**  **University made me get an observed drug test before they will consider prescribing me standard ADHD medication. I am hoping for others who have gone through this process at their universities will share their stories to help me get a sense of how normal or abnormal mine is.**  Thank you all!
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Having a different sleeping schedule?;;;If I wake up at 9:30 am and take adderall XR and go to bed at 12:30am, thats 15 hours awake time  but lately ive been wondering, what if i was to just say you know what, screw waking up on a guaranteed "regular folk" time, that you never can realistically stick to. I have good intentions, like im gonna wake up at 8am or some shit, but it seems so often, it slips away from me, and i go from 8 am, to waking up at 9am, to 9 30am, then the next day 10 am, 10 30 am.. and of course each of these nights, going to bed later and later.. Its like i try to stick to a routine, but its not always working out  so i thought what if i just stop trying to meet these deadlines and just operate in a fashion where it doesnt matter what time you wake up or go to sleep, as long as your awake time is roughly 15 hours or so.. and your sleep time is 8-9 hours  so if i wake up at noon, i take adderall XR, and then go to bed at 3am = 15 hours awake time  or if somehow things shift and i wake up at 1pm instead of noon, then take adderall xr, and then go to bed 15 hours from the time i woke up, which would mean bed time is 4am, but so what right? as long as im awake the same amount of time  I realize that if i keep waking up and going to bed at odd times, ill be disconnected with the rest of the world in a way, but i work from home and im just wanting to find out if maybe this is easier for me to do it this alternative way  1. Does anyone else do this? 2. I wonder if the adderall would still be effective  Ideally, i still want to do the regular 9-5 thing sleeping schedule.. Its just not always working out even though I want it to. Maybe it has to do with this http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24117273 or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm_sleep_disorder  I just feel like, I start out with good intentions, but my sleeping schedule continually shifts by one hour and just keeps getting bumped up and bumped up.. To the point where i FEEL like its too late to take adderall XR.. so thats why now i started wondering hey maybe as long as you are awake the same amount of hours (15 hours), it dont matter what time you goto bed, and adderall should still work. I might try this out

A little background knowledge; I've been doing martial arts since I was 5, and have really strong legs...and very solid kicks. At the point in time this story is from I could easily kick a punching bag over from a still front kick.  So I will was at school and everyone was exiting for recess. I was talking to my friend we'll call 'B'. I was using my hands to explain some to B so I decided to push the door open with my foot. So still talking to B I lifted my leg to push the door (I was going to push the bottom part of the door, lightly, not a salon style door opening) But because im me this couldn't NOT go wrong.  I somehow managed to zone out mid way through lifting my leg, so defaulting back to what I usually do when I lift my my leg like that...   I kicked...  Hard.  Now I was aiming for the bottom of the metal part of the door that is around 9" thick on the parameter of the door.  When I kicked I hit the glass that was in the middle. The sound of it shattering cut through the sounds of the busy hallway, everybody stopped and stared.  This glass I just broke was reinforced, designed to withstand hits and keep burglars\unwelcomed people out. No one has ever even cracked it before. I had just broken it... I was freaking out almost in tears because I was sure I was going to get in tons of trouble. Most of the teachers hated me at the school (see undiagnosed ADHD) and would love to see me suspended.  The Vice principal called me into his office.  He looked at me,  Took his glasses off  And... He started Laughing!?!  Apparently he found it hilarious and I got away scott free! My parents didn't even have to pay for the glass.   From that day on I was known as "anger issues" by my classmates.   THE END   TL;DR: I managed to kick through reinforced glass after zoning out... Yup

Not sure if this is against the rules, just need some life advice.;;;I started seeing my psychologist back in early march for depression and anxiety. At the same time I went to my family doctor and was prescribed antidepressants. Fast forward to 3 weeks ago. My psychologist believes I may have ADHD after our months of meeting. My entire life I've noticed the symptoms he told me I had, but as a kid I always thought ADHD just meant you were super hyper all the time, which I wasn't. My grades were always just okay, and my parents were the type to just say get over it or try harder.   He tells me to call my FD to schedule an appointment, which I have to wait a week for. The day comes and an hour before my appointment they ask if I'll have any documentation with me, which I don't (I have never been tested before). They then tell me I have to go to to a different clinic to get tested before I can come in for an appointment. I then called this clinic, which told me the soonest appointment to get me in would be a month away. I was heartbroken. I went home that day to look up the clinic and found all 1-2 star reviews on their google page, which doesn't really mean much, but I started having second thoughts. I also read you have to go to 2 appointments, each 2 hours long, and then wait 2 weeks to get your results back. Now this seems way over the top to me. I had an appointment with my psych today, and he went over the ADHD questions with me, and determined I have all 9 signs of ADHD inattentive. He then wrote up a letter and faxed it to my FD. I now wait to see what she says, but don't know what to do. I'd love to just go in to my FD and have her write me a prescription, but at the same time I see their reasoning to have me go to this clinic to be 100% sure. I'm now having second thoughts about going to a psychologist instead of a psychiatrist. Has anyone been in this situation before? Just need some advice about what to do.  Thanks  ***TL;DR***:Psychologist diagnosed me with ADHD, Family Doctor wants to send me to clinic to get tested. Weary about going. Need advice

I apologize in advance for any formatting issues or if this isn't the right place to post this):  I suspect that I may have some form of ADHD. (I think my mom's side of the family has a lot of undiagnosed mental issues). Whenever I look up information about ADHD I can check off many of the symptoms that I either remember from my childhood (I'm 27 now), or that I am currently still experiencing (bored easily, can't sit still, losing/misplacing/forgetting things, trouble paying attention to things I don't find interesting, easy to start tasks but hard to see them through to the end, etc.) I have a bit of a history of being let go from jobs in which the work is not something I'm really into, but that's not as much of an issue in my current job.  If diagnosed, I would not want to take medication, I would rather work on changing my lifestyle and/or habits to help with any problems. I  My question for r/ADHD/ is this: since I would not want to take any kind of medication, is there even a point to getting a diagnosis? What would the benefits of finding out at this point in my life? I already have many coping habits I've adopted over the years that have helped me with some of my issues. My worry is that it would end up being an expensive doctor visit and finding out whether or not I actually have ADHD would not have much impact on my day-to-day life at this point.  TLDR: 27F, not interested in medication, want to know what are the benefits of getting diagnosed as an adult or if it would be a waste of my time?   (edit: grammar)
6657466ffa42458d3c746bde84d8b1b353271db8a4e28a5202e2ebfa307e9aae;;;I have become increasingly dependant on Aderoll inorder to produce superior works of writing;;;I was diagnosed with ADHD Inattentive type around March this year and have been trialling vsarious medications ever since.   At first I was prescribed Concerta, but soon switched to Aderall after I experienced a particularly intense migraine while on the drug. Aderall had little to no effect until I reached a dosage of 10-15mg which eventually became 30mg where it remained.                      When on the stimulant, I would experience moments of intense creativity which I  channeled in the medium of writing. I wrote various poetic pieces as well as other literary works. While under Aderall's influence, the writing I produced in rather prolific fashion felt superior to most of the writing I produced off the medication, but at times the work appeared no more superior in quality when viewed at a later date while off the medication.   Regardless, the feeling of producing work I could be proud of in an artistic manner soon grew addictive. It wasn't difficult to get my "fix" of this euphoria while in school, as I was alotted 30mg each morning prior, but as one would expect, my grades suffered significantly as I neglected completing the assigned work and in place produced said literary pieces.   This combined with the fact that I lost nearly 12 pounds since I had started the drug led to my parent's decision to have me stop taking it once on summer vacation. 12 pounds I assume is a good deal for a person of my weight and stature to lose, as I am already rather scrawny.                                                                               However, losing the weight was something I was honestly okay with, mainly because I had become rather insecure about my face being seen as "chubby". Regardless, a drop from 128 pounds to 116 is of course not particularly healthy for a 10th grade boy, but my self image waned everytime I would actually make an effort to gain back any weight.                                                                        The issue I'm currently faced with is a reliance on the medication. Often times when I attempt to write off of Aderall, the end product seems strained and mediocre, or at least feels that way while I'm writing it. Due to this, for the past month I've continued to discretely take the remaining 30 mg medication left over from the school year. In fact, I'm writing this shortly after taking the last of the pills.                                                                               My parents will most likely not notice the drugs absence as it's bottle was kept in a hodgepodge of other general medications which they never check.                                                                                I'm not really sure what to do now. I'll soon start gaining weight due to an increase in apetite, and immediately feel insecure as a result. I'll lose my ability to produce fufilling literary work, not too mention the ability to sustain focus. I just don't fucking know. I'm  not even sure what I'm asking here.   **TL;DR** Wrote well on Adderall, but lost 12 pounds in process. Kept taking Aderall behind parent's back after parents stopped providing it to me during summer vacation. Writing feels strained and poor when off of Aderall, and gaining weight hurts self confidence. Not sure what to do now that Aderall has run out.

For the rest of the day I felt very odd, and near the afternoon I started getting extreme out of body anxiety, something felt wrong and I couldn't quite pin point it. On top of that, i was home alone, which made it so much worse. For a brief moment I actually doubted that I was myself. Maybe this is just an odd occurrence but after doing cardio for 30 minutes I felt 100x better. So, moral of the story guys, exercise (especially cardio) is SO important.

I have to set multiple alarms and often sleep through all of them.

I have a really hard time relaxing at night, often getting to bed as late as 2 or 3 A.M. (either because I keep getting distracted by minor things or because I simply can't fall asleep). When I do manage to fall asleep I am a very heavy sleeper. I sleep through the night without interruption (bad weather, noises outside, rarely wake me). I have vivid, and sometimes intense, dreams nearly every night which indicates to me that I'm undergoing some REM sleep, but I often wake up feeling un-rested (even when I get 10+ hours of sleep). I'm very sluggish in the morning. It takes me a long time to wake up fully. Sometimes I fall back to sleep and have to wake back up multiple times, and when I do I often can't remember turning off my alarm/the first time I woke up.   For a few years I hoped this would just go away as I got older and required fewer hours of sleep, but this doesn't seem to be the case.   It's a pretty embarrassing problem. Sometimes when I'm home for the summer my mother has to wake me up for work after I've slept through my alarms (though this is a somewhat rare occurrence it's pretty troubling to me). I'm a 21 for fuck's sake. I'm frustrated and ashamed that my mother has to wake me up for work, and I'm increasingly terrified that when I have a career and I live on my own, I'll do alright for a few months, then sleep really late and get myself fired.   I was diagnosed with adult ADHD 2 months ago and have been on 40mg (20mg twice daily) Adderall IR, but this doesn't seem to be affecting my sleep patterns in any way.   Does anyone else have a similar problem? If so how did/do you deal with it?  **TL;DR I have a the worst of both worlds with sleep. I have a hard time falling asleep at night and an even harder time waking up in the morning. I sleep like a corpse and occasionally sleep through obligations. Wondering if anyone else has similar problems, or if this is even related to ADHD**

fb33ae01bbff4a3ec5161bef0a10ca5c2d2024c4b2efd5d3c9a00d22a027e451;;;dose not as effective;;;Hi all. I was diagnosed with adhd, mild ocd and gad a few years ago. I have been on 40mg of adderall xr for about 2.5 years (started at 20 and bumped up to 40 about 18 months ago).   We tried several meds in the beginning, as my insurance at the time allowed me to see a psychiatrist. I was formally tested. Concerta sends me into a blind rage when the meds wear off, adderall ir stopped being effective within about 3 months.  Now my insurance does not cover a psychiatrist so I see a general physician for my refills. He has access to my records, as he is in the hospital network that my psychiatrist was in.   The last 1-2 months, I feel like my meds are not effective. I'm spacing out a lot, getting disorganized, distracted. I'm not sure if it's related to stress or if it's related to my adderal dose not being effective. Honestly I think it is the adderall. How do I go about discussing the dose with my dr? My previous dr was experienced with meds so he would evaluate where I was every 3-6 months on dose and change based on his notes, my notes, and my therapist. I no longer see a therapist.  I just don't want to come off as a junkie or something.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;The problem was my professor, not me. [rant]?;;;I registered for a 5.5 week summer class. It was on online course, something I've had no issue with after taking four online courses. The only material we got from the professor was a "study guide"  that essentially told us to study the entire unit (3 chapters, 5-6 sub-chapters each). The chapters were long and in depth enough, that one could get a 30 question test from each chapter. I had no idea what to focus on, so I emailed the prof for clarification and got a poem about being responsible in response.   I then reached out to my other classmates, asking if someone who has taken a test to contact me to discuss. Turns out, this student took 2 tests already and despite spending ~12 hours per unit studying the material in depth, got 10 out of 30 questions wrong.  She described the questions as deliberately confusing and twisted. We agreed that we are both above average academically an tested well, but that this prof and his class was an absolute shit-show. She told me she planned on dropping the class, as her GPA was 3.9 and didn't want this clads to fuck it up.   After confirming that I was not the asshole here,  i dropped the class, with the official reason being that the instructor was not doing a satisfactory job. The instructor is informed of my dropping and the reason. Luckily I picked up a class for the 2nd 5.5 week session so I don't have to deal with financial aid consequences, but I lost out on 100% of the money I paid for this class. Plus,  I not have to pay for the new class, though it's all worth it in my opinion. Also, my state only allows a certain number of withdrawls for your entire undergrad, so I had to use one due to no fault of my own.   I'm glad that I am not the idiot here.I was starting to feel very discouraged, to the point of tears. RateMyProfessor reviews corroborated the experiences of the other student and myself, so I will sure take that site into consideration next time I register.   Shitty teachers and professors are the worst, and it is especially frustrating when you are also dealing with ADHD, since it's sometimes hard to tell if it's THEM or YOU that is the  issue.   I guess I'm just posting to share my story, as well as hear some stories from others who might have experienced this same thing... It's nice to know you aren't alone

What have your experiences been?;;;I was diagnosed when I was about 8 and took medication, mainly Straterra, until I was 12 when I requested to go off of it. I'm 20 now and have been doing pretty well without medication. I finally decided to get my ass into gear and learn how to drive, and I find that my inattentive habits have started appearing again. There are very few activities in my life that require 110% attention like driving does. I'm not a dangerous driver by any means (I think I'm actually pretty good for my age and experience level), but the thought of all that attention psychs me out. I also have some anxiety issues that are making my worries worse.  What have your experiences been with medication and driving? I have an appointment with my doctor next week to discuss my concerns and I want to be semi-prepared.

For the most part I've been doing really well with it. Although, recently I noticed one of my symptoms has persisted. I can never finish books or projects. I always end up stopping midway in favor of another book or project. I think I'm currently in the middle of 5 or 6 books. Some of them have as little as 20 pages left. Yet I can't seem to bring myself to finish them. Any advice?
f7ce0d4dc56506bf5fbc1143e9bd3d986251045418bc3d3389fa2895f5a4d874;;;As an adult, where/how do I start regarding diagnostic evaluation? (;;;Background information: This is long, you can skip to the last paragraph if you want.   Had school issues during childhood/early adolescence. School attributed it to be behavior problems (despite that I had never acted out in class, rather just didn't pay attention, forgot homework, and came late). My parents just thought I was lazy. It's important to note that my parents are also fervently anti-ADHD (and also mental illness) diagnosis. Social issues were a lot more apparent. I've had issues with peer interaction for as long as I could remember. Despite all of this, I ended up graduating high school and heading to college.   Academically, college was similar to high school. Decent, but I probably could have done better. I didn't think much of it, for the most part. Socially, I had made a lot of friends in the beginning, but they quickly tired of me and I could not understand why. Then I started developing significant depression/anxiety issues, mostly relating to a breakup. This prompted me to go to the counseling center, and the counselor suggested I go to the psychiatrist for medication.   The psychiatrist suggested that many of the mental health issues I had been facing trace back to undiagnosed ADHD (note: I did not mention or write anything about ADHD or academic problems or attention at all, she had brought this up completely on her own). She gave me some information regarding places to receive assessment/diagnosis. Since it was the end of the semester, however, I ended up not being able to get an assessment at school, due to time constraints.   Fast forward to Fall Semester, I'm having similar issues, but I never call the diagnostic center. I forget or get distracted. For an entire semester.   In the Spring, I finally call in April because my symptoms had been worsening (probably as a result of a significantly more difficult schedule). Seriously, multiple people asked me if I had ADHD. I'm almost on my way to receiving an assessment, until I tell the psychologist that I have a "space occupying lesion" in my prefrontal cortex area. Due to this information, she has to switch my assessment group from "Learning Disorders and ADHD" to "Organic Brain Damage".   I do not receive a call from this new group until over a month later. By this point, it was already finals week and graduation. It's too late for me to finish an assessment and receive my results, since I am not living in my college town post graduation.   However, within this time frame, I had received adderall from a friend of mine who had apparently felt bad for me, as he also had undiagnosed ADHD for a while (note: I did not bring up thinking I had ADHD; he asked me if I had it). It did wonders for me. I was able to speak at a regular pace. I could drown out background noise. I was able to have a conversation with ease. Most importantly, I was able to think more coherently, and figure out my thought processes, which had been a mystery to me before. Additionally, it helped manage my anxiety because I was finally able to think myself out of the ridiculous conclusions I had always concocted whenever I had not been thinking clearly (bad habit of catastrophizing everything)   Currently, I have moved back home so I can save money for grad school. My short term memory is despicable. I can't seem to understand verbal directions. I cannot think linearly. I always always always end up interrupting people, and I try my hardest not to. According to others, I talk excessively fast. The list goes on and on. I've decided I'm sick of living this way.   However, as an adult who is currently not in school, I do not know how to address this. My parents are still extremely anti-ADHD diagnosis, so turning to them is unhelpful. I should have asked at my physical yesterday, but I forgot. What did I do? Do I call random psychologists in the area? I have no idea where to start, and I am afraid I won't be able to finish on my own, since I have a track record of never finishing anything. As an adult, how and where do I get started?   Tl;dr: I think I might have ADHD, as an adult where do I start?
ea38229d7f56400ff48e1fff8a767a737a9de3c70942254374da00ac81b8ae62;;;What's the general order of what meds MD's will put you on without a response?;;;So I see my nurse practitioner tomorrow to follow up on my medication. I first tried Straterra, didn't feel a thing, then I tried Concerta, nothing, then I was put on to Adderall, but it only keeps me up. My NP had me on 18mg of Concerta for two weeks, then 24mg for three weeks. Wasted a month to find out nothing happened. So she told me when she prescribed me the Adderall that if I didn't feel anything on 10mg, to take two of them a day for 20mg total. I went as far up as 30, in the interest of time, and that kept me up until 5am on two different nights(had to verify so did it twice). So I know what my optimal dose is of Adderall, but it didn't really help me focus or give me motivation. When I tell her this, where do you think this'll end up going? And if anybody has had the same resistance to these medications, have you found one that works and if so, what is it? I understand everybody responds differently, but considering we have the same resistances to these medications, it may be alright to assume we have similar brain chemistry so what works for you MAY work for me. Anyways, thanks for the feedback in advance. :)
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;My experience so far on Adderall XR;;;- I've lost a lot of interest in things I used to waste endless time on. I still like the same shows, I still like what I liked before.. but it's hard to find time to watch tv shows or do shit like that.. maybe because now im actually in gear and getting stuff done?? Maybe now im busier, idk   I don't view this as the end of the world....as its far more important that I keep my eye on the prize, doing work, focusing on important stuff, so that my life improves financially, etc.. but god damn I used to be so into game of thrones and so many shows, and its just hard to find time to sit down and watch them now.  - Another thing I noticed, even when I DO try to watch what i want to watch, i find myself wandering off.. to go do other shit.. Before, I could easily dedicate myself to a tv show.. **The only time i dont wander off now, is when im doing IMPORTANT stuff that actually matters** Funny how that works.  - Sleep is much harder than without adderall, this is probably common im sure  - **Feeling Incredible when I do take it:** When I wake up early, slept adequate hours (before waking up), and take my adderall XR, I just feel so incredible. Not right away, but once I eat. I take it once I wake up, then 30 mins later I eat breakfast. After that, i just feel fucking amazing. Almost like im on top of the world. I can't remember if I truly felt like this before I got my meds.. Maybe I might have some days, i dunno, its hard to say  Does anyone else feel this way? It just makes me feel like god damn, I don't ever want to stop taking this shit. I almost feel like its kinda artificial in a way. Like before meds, I don't think i felt incredible each and everyday.. vs if I take adderall everyday, I feel pretty fucking amazing (assuming there are no negative factors, like not sleeping enough)  Its not the euphoria. I'm well past that. It's just a general sense of amazingness. Also I can't help it but secretly love the fact that this shit gives you lots of energy, physically..  But I know deep down, I don't want to be taking adderall for the next 20 years.. so im trying to create plans to set my self up in such a way where I only need it for the next few years, then I can just hire people etc
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Tired after taking adderall + other issues;;;I was diagnosed with ADHD about 7 or 8 years ago but due to many reasons I didn't take any medication for the past 5 years. I just started taking Adderall (20mg XR in the morning + 20mg IR in the afternoon.) I did take Adderall before when I was first diagnosed also.   I have been on Adderall for about 3 weeks now. The first week or so I felt really productive and able to do a lot of long term projects I have been putting off. Now that feeling has pretty much worn off. I will say that my mind is much more quiet (if that makes sense) and that I have an easier job focusing once I get started on a task. I also have an easier job of controlling my temper. However, I feel very tired most of the day, almost to the point of lethargy. What is up with that? I stopped drinking coffee when I started Adderall because the caffeine made me jittery but maybe I need to start adding some back in or something. I used to drink around 8 cups of coffee a day so that was a change for me.  The other issue that I have right now is I got a UTI for the first time in a long time. I read that UTIs could be a side effect of Adderall, has anyone else had that experience? I'm taking antibiotics for that right now also.   If anyone has experienced either of these issues I would like to hear about it and what worked to make you feel better/less tired.

I'm not taking away from the fact that it is a disability but i also see it as a severe lack of motivation. For years i would be lazy and hyper focus on the wrong things. For a lot of us we may be going down routes were not supposed to, hence a severe lack of motivation to get anything done in the field were in. Recently I've managed to light the fire in me and started getting things done. What I did along with taking my medication for it was change my mindset. I dropped a class because it was too difficult and instead of wasting the rest of my summer away playing video games which are my total weakness is i have taken up programming. I've got it drilled into my head that computer science is what i want to do and now being on the verge of failing out of school it's what i have to do. I've never wanted anything more than to succeed in this and with that said I've started busting my ass and it's helped significantly with my motivation. Some days lets face it, i really don't think there's much you can do to get motivated but other days when you are I encourage you to try your hardest at it. As for finding the right field for yourself. A little about me last year i had an municipal engineering internship. I was motivated to do well at first but it was the most boring thing in the world and it was easy to get distracted from. On top of that it wasn't paid so my motivation was next to nothing. After three months i was let go and i hardly regret anything from that experience. What i learned from it is i will never accomplish anything with out the proper motivation. Now I'm doing something completely different, I'm in commision based sales at a retail store. On average i'm probably making minimum wage but there's just something about having very relaxed managers who basically say, "We don't care what you do. Just make us money and make yourself money." For whatever reason I'm highly motivated and i work my ass off for minimum wage sales, loving every second of it. I'm not behind a desk, i get to be on my feet and talk to people, make friends and make money in the process. For me it's an extroverted adrenaline rush of get fired or make bank. Now what I've done is i'm taking that motivation and setting my goals on the far future. If i graduate with a computer science degree i could be making 60k a year!! And let me tell you thinking about that and actually wanting it has turned my lazy work ethic around. It's all about figuring out ways to lighting that fire underneath you. I really hope this helps some of you. I'll try to answer any questions in a timely manner. Sorry if this was super scatter brained :(

I've been trying to self medicate for years, and treat anxiety that directly ties to my ADHD.

fef233af3c0ecb2e013fbf09bd87659202ed145fd6739eaf7e3d829be10194cf;;;People diagnosed as adults: what made you decide to get "evaluated"?;;;(Background) Hello, first-time poster on this sub but I've lurked for a long time. My partner has ADHD-C and this has been a huge resource for helping me to understand him, as someone who (like most of the public, unfortunately) knew little to nothing about ADHD before meeting him. My partner was diagnosed as a kid and has pretty steadily taken the same meds for a long time, and they work for him. He was/is a great student and has a great job where he seems to be greatly respected, especially as an intern.   (Actual question) This has happened occasionally throughout our relationship, but lately it's been happening far more often: there are moments when I'll say something to the boyfriend and he'll kind of squint at me funny and say, "Are you sure you don't have ADD"? He definitely knows what to look for, what with having had it his entire life. That, and the fact that based on a lot of the research I've done, I do fit some of the characteristics. However, I've also been under a lot of stress right now, so how do I know I'm not just looking for an excuse? I'll clarify: I do know that ADHD isn't "just an excuse." I've done more than enough research, and I understand what it means. What I'm saying is, at what point do you cross from just being someone who at the moment is doing something often associated with ADHD, to realizing that you might actually have it? Especially as an adult who may not consistently have exhibited symptoms until adulthood, at what point do you decide that what's going on isn't normal? About a year ago I was having similar suspicions about having ADHD and mentioned it to my mother, who criticized it as, like I mentioned before, just looking for an excuse. Not that she's unhelpful! I've had depression in the past and while she was a bit critical of that as well (despite having had it herself at one point) she still got me the help I needed. Right now, when I go through all those online "Do you have ADHD???" checklists, I'm never quite sure whether I'm just convincing myself that these things are true (like when people send those emails telling you "I bet you can't say the letter 'p' without separating your lips" and you subconsciously have to do it) and looking for a way out of a different issue by categorizing it however I can, or if they really are true. How do you know you aren't lying to yourself, one way or the other? I would rather not have ADHD, and I'm sure most people on here would agree; but if I do, going on pretending that I don't and letting my grades and social life drop off isn't the best answer.   TL;DR : I know the rules say not to ask whether or not to get tested. I'm not asking that. I want to know, for people who didn't exhibit symptoms as kids but started to as adults, what factor or moment or whatever was the deciding point for you to get evaluated?   Thanks!

I was a student who had, until that point, 12 consecutive years of stellar grades and was even accepted into one of the top 5 schools in the country (UChicago).  However, going through college was a let down of sorts and I was never able to study or absorb information. I somewhat jokingly told my therapist, parents and friends that I had not been able to learn anything since my junior year in high school.   Second semester sophomore year, I was in a terrible rut which one of my profs helped pull me out of and encouraged me to get help. It was diagnosed as depression and we went on from there with mostly anti-depressive meds.   First and Second Semesters of Junior year were relapses. No other words for it. The second relapse was probably caused by a huge downpour-- grandparent dying do to a car accident, dislocating shoulder and needing surgery and then just being stressed beyond myself. I don't know what I could have done differently at the time and every time I think back to then, I wish I had some answer so that "I didn't waste 1.5 years of my life." One of the classes I regretted not being able to finish the most was Chinese. So, being the dubious idiot I am, I decided to take it this summer and "try again" but this time my psychiatrist prescribed me Vyvanse. I'm not going to say it's some sort of miracle drug, but for a guy who has never gotten a compliment in organization or handwriting his entire life, my notes, writing and even thoughts have become clearer. I don't know if this will be a new beginning and the end of these troubles-- but I want to believe so. Anyway, optimism is a stupid thing as it makes us believe anything is possible. If the past 2 years have taught me nothing else, don't be afraid of new possibilities-- they may help.  TL;DR-- failed miserably in school for 3 semesters taking summer chinese with Vyvanse and can see a clear difference--

(means that I have a hard time processing information, especially auditory, and difficulty with memory retrieval. I can learn things but have a difficult time recalling them unless I have something to remind me.)  So my brother, now 17, also has ADHD and has been on Focalin since he was 5 or so but my parents are strongly strongly against medication for me. They think I should try to do a semester of uni with the new accommodations they'll give me, but I think the root issue will still be present. It doesn't matter if I have a note taker for lectures and can record the lectures and have dragon naturally speaking transcribe lectures into readable notes if I can't sustain focus long enough to read them.   My parents also worry about me going through the med trial period (I know there's a fancy name but can't remember what) without them to monitor me, but I know the trial period could take up to six months and I can't take six months out of my life to move back home, that's more than a semester of school. The other catch 22 is I live in Canada and they live in the states, so there's a different set of meds available there than there is here.  And I could start meds without their blessing, I have insurance through my school, doctors are covered by the socialized healthcare, my roommate is starting her phD is psychology in the fall and would 100% keep an eye on me, both as a close friend that knows me well and as someone that knows what bad side effects look like.   Are there any of you that aren't medicating but managing? Or any trial period/side effect horror stories? Or anyone that is on medication and loves it/hates it?   Thanks in advance.

My experiences with Strattera and Adderall;;;Long time lurker here, just thought I'd share my experiences with you guys in regards to how I was diagnosed and my experiences so far with medication management.    **Background:** I was never diagnosed as a child, but my brother did.  As far as school goes, I was in special ed/small classes along with ESL (English second language) because I was struggling with academics.  My parents didn't think much of it because they thought it was a language barrier.  They always spoke Vietnamese to me at home, and still do.  Despite the struggle, I was never really considered hyperactive like my sibling, just very spacy, highly sensitive, and talkative (talking over people all the time).  At one point in elementary, I wasn't allowed to go to the bathroom by myself because I had spent nearly an hour playing with polly pockets and silly putty instead of being in class.   Eventually, people started to imply I was stupid, and it sort of developed into anxiety well into adulthood.     Fast forward, I went on to get my Bachelors in Nursing. I no longer had ESL or special ed classes to rely on or study hall.  I always came in early to get help from my professors. The process was a bit of a mess, and I only took 2-3 classes at a time because I wanted that high GPA. And this was all without having a job.  My parents were very supportive of me.   **Diagnosis:**  I hit a wall at work as a Nurse, and nearly got fired for being “me.” I could no longer hide my symptoms; I actually had to socialize.  Went to my doctor's office to bring up the issue and got referred to a psychologist for further testing.  After hours of testing via personality, IQ, TOVA, and an interview, I got diagnosed with ADHD w/ comorbid anxiety.   **Medication experience:**  Strattera- Strattera was the first med I was on.  The effects of the medication was barely noticeable, and I gradually titrated up to 60 mg. However, I did notice that I didn't talk over people as much, and I didn't have 50 thoughts shooting off all at once.  But I didn't notice much of a change in my attention span or organization.   Adderall IR-I told my doctor about this, and she prescribed me Adderall IR. ER was not prescribed because I also have insomnia issues. I had also stopped Strattera.  My first night trying it out was at work. It took about 30 minutes to kick in after taking it, and it felt very “quiet” in my head.  I wasn't jumping all over the place in terms of what I wanted to do first.  I had a sense of direction, and my reports were concise and to the point.  But, I didn't feel the euphoria as a lot of people were describing in some threads.  The downfall though, was that it only lasts about 4-5 hours for me before I start getting disorganized in thought again.  My impulsive showed its rear end when I started immediately regretting some of things said to my co-workers.       Extremely dehydrated and my bladder hurts. I went home and had at least 20 or more internet tabs open, TV on while texting people on my phone and telling my dog how pretty she is.  My clothes were everywhere because I forgot to put them in the hamper.  And now I'm squinting while typing this because I don’t know where I've put my glasses all while looking stuff up for my next art project that I won't finish.   **TL;DR:**  I grew up bilingual and didn't get diagnosed with ADHD until well after college. Strattera helped a little, and I don't think Adderall IR will work because it doesn't last when I need it to.    **Question:** Need longer lasting medication, but I also don't want to stay up all night and have the ADHD symptoms come rushing back.  Advice?  Edit: Reformatted, and added more detail to strattera exp.

I'm struggling with feelings of guilt and shame that I thought I had put behind me a long time ago with the treatment of my depression.  It feels like I've failed in some way.  I know that this isn't true, and I hope to get over it in time, but I could use some support or words of advice at the moment.  I haven't felt this worthless in years, honestly.  I'm also looking to move to the UK at some point and I'm wondering how it will all work.  I was reading some of the wiki material for this subreddit and how you can only be diagnosed by an ADHD specialist in the UK, and that can take up to a year.  Does that mean I'd have to go without medication and treatment for a year, or does it make a difference if I've been diagnosed in the US first?  Did anyone else experience feelings of shame like this when they were first diagnosed? I haven't even been able to tell my spouse yet, I've just told him I've been put on a new medication.  I'm not normally like this about mental health issues (I'm known for being really straightforward and vocal about them) so it's been hitting me pretty hard.  Thanks in advance for any help!

I freeze up and can't do anything.  I can't be creative, i can't write or draw.  Someone tells me a word and asks me to say the first thing that comes to mind.... i freeze up.  At the same time I've got so many things i want to write... i just can't.  I do have anxiety problems but this happens when i'm not feeling anxious as well.  Does this sound like ADHD at all?      I've been searching for years for a solution to my problem, it's pretty much destroyed any chance of passing anything.  It's also effecting everyday stuff, i pretty much can't look after myself.  And I HAVE been diagnosed with ADHD (without hyperactivity) and Aspergers at different points but my psychologist just doesn't want to address them (I've been told he's shit and I have to go see someone else).
ff83dcb64b0964f506e8f77c7599cccdfacfe837e8b2b451021d81cf4c8a1d2d;;;ADHD and Hobbies;;;First post under this account but I've been here before.  I just wanted to share my thoughts and ask for input on hobbies. I've always been envious of people (ADD or non) who are able to hyperfocus on something, whether it's productive or fun or just work. As someone who was undiagnosed until college, I didn't have the motivation or ability to pursue things throughout my adolescence so I've always felt like I've had a lot of catch up to do from people who have been doing things for years. I get super envious of people who do the things I'm interested in, like programming, guitar, music production, sports, etc., but have been doing them since they were younger and are past that "learning" phase.  I think everyone here knows how hard it is to get over the hump of learning something new. We just want to get into that gratifying stage of being good at something, but can never stick with a hobby long enough to get there. Does anyone have tips for toughing out the grace period between starting something new and getting good enough to have fun with it?

A big portion of my job is having periods of time where i have to do monotonous task.

Can I get fired for requesting to wear them? Should I "come out" as ADHD, no one knows there? Help. Please.

84666662d7e24e4591a4ae0f66a59d02193856bd224e198681e51d2ebb3d56ca;;;I'm having a "humble" moment right now being back on meds for the first time in a few months and I want to document it while I can.;;;(Not trying to be sappy here. Skip the first part if you want. The point of this is just that I have some useful observations being back on medication after awhile, and I wanted to share in case it helps anyone. Makin' dank posts on reddit is about taking risks you know.)  I say "while I can" in the title because I think a lot of the problem with us ADHDers, especially here at r/ADHD, is that 1) we take no satisfaction in this disorder, we just want in the main to get over this condition and move on. Helping each other of course along the way. The trouble is sometimes in the process we don't admit how bad it is, or that we haven't made the progress we tell ourselves we had. Especially because a lot of us here tend to see ourselves as somewhat "bright" and capable folks. (We're "redditors" right o0o0o0o0ohh...)  2) Another problem is frankly a lot of us here are dudes. I imagine there's more women represented on this sub than other places on reddit, and some guys are gifted with emotional intelligence in admirable ways, but the fact is a lot of us are stereotypical dudes and if any of you are anything like me you either a) don't know how you feel a lot of the time or b) are delusional about it. Especially when it comes to ADHD.  So, I fall into both these categories. And as a result, I don't have "humble moments" as often as I should. (I'll probably deny I had this one later.) But the shock of being back on meds after a few months off has made a few things clear. At least for the time being (hence why I need to document this for at least my future self):  1) I'm not as content as I tell myself I am off medicine. That's not to say I'm unhappy. I've got it pretty good, and I'm one of the lucky ones whose personality is kind of "ADHD" anyway (spontaneous, eccentric, absent-minded), which I think helps in a lot of ways. But my quality of life isn't what it should be. From constantly needing stimulation, to just not being able to fully account for where the weeks and days went,  makes it so even on my best days I'm still experiencing a somewhat "reduced" existence.  2) I'm really, really, really, really angry. All the time. About everything. About nothing. And I actually go out of my way to find something to lock into and be angry about and just pace around and be mad. It's weird. I didn't realize how angry I was until I got on meds again. I'm a lot calmer. Things aren't so dramatic. The world is a bit less irritating. I'm less impulsive. I don't know what it is. But I'm often just fuming inside off meds I realized.  3) I talk way too much off meds. I go too fast and say too much. On meds this is totally unnecessary all of a sudden. I don't know if my thoughts are more organized, or my thinking is slowed down, or just more organized, but it's noticeable. I used to think it was a personality thing but I don't knwo that it is and I'm pretty sure people take me less seriously because of it at work and school.  4) I think I'm pretty fearful off medicine. Because deep down I'm uncertain if I'm going to follow through on anything I commit to. So I'm afraid of doing new things and I'm afraid I won't get where I need to be in life. I'm way more confident all of a sudden on medicine, and can admit to myself I am afraid of certain things and is the reason I bury myself in League of Legends or pornography instead of doing something intelligent or constructive.  5) I'm a lot nicer on medicine. I can see things from other people's perspectives. I have suddenly have time to be altruistic. I'm pretty self-absorbed otherwise, and I don't exactly know why, but I wish it wasn't true, because I think I become pretty isolated. I'm always worrying about myself or looking out for myself or just ignoring any opportunities that require too much effort.  6) Lastly stuff just isn't as painful. This is a big one because it really adds up. Paying my bills or doing stuff for school or even going shopping for clothes or something isn't such a chore. I feel dumb for not doing this before.  So that's a few of my observations. I always think I've learned to manage my ADHD and get off meds for awhile. Then I get back on them and I just can't believe the difference again. I'm realizing there's some things I really can't do without meds.

It happened after I tried a mood stabilizer that *really* brought out my distractibility and impulsiveness, as well as impatience and not being able to sit or think for long periods of time.  I can remember being a kid and not paying attention to the teacher much. Then I'd meet reprimanded because I was supposed to be in the gifted program, but it was a struggle. I remember forgetting to do chores and my mom would accuse me of doing it on purpose. My life has been like living in a dream in my own mind, and out of touch with reality. For years I thought it was just anxiety.  The doctor prescribed Vyvanse and I'm excited to have possibly found a solution. Being able to plan out my day, and even a future now, sounds great. But I'll be honest, I've made some bad mistakes and turned people away over the years. I think my answer to the confusion in my mind was to become very avoidant because of shame. Not only avoidant, but shy with low self esteem. I've felt like I've had to prove to others I'm not stupid or purposely rude, and that in itself is a lot of work. People just know me a the quiet girl, but Im a human being, too. I can have hobbies and be loved. I can have friends and speak my mind and have a personality. It's the first time this has been a possibility.  How do I pick up the pieces of my life and make it better? I'm afraid my family and what few friends I have left have a negative view of who I am, and it's very lonely right now. My SO is supportive at least, but I've been a mess trying all this medication lately and I fear it will be awhile before he trusts my moods enough for marriage. It sucks being 31, unmarried, with the same job for 10 years and a bad reputation, even though my heart is in the right place. I'd love to meet new people and some day start a family and be a part of a community.   Anyone have experience becoming medicated and changing your life around? What are some first steps to take?
fab5a19177c86dcfcfca9cb35659ac0b955c344c05e88a83dc2a0bf5150d79e4;;;Doctor vs. ADHD Psychiatrist; how to choose sides. (So long, but I am so in need of encouragement :/);;;**TL;DR - High tolerance, so Adderall IR 60mg/day isn't overly helpful.**  **Doctor wanted to add another adhd med and get me off antianxiety pills, but sends me to psychiatrist first.**  **ADHD psychiatrist changes my dose to Adderall XR 40mg/day, tells me to stay on the antidepressant med, and that more strategies will do the rest.**  **I prefer the doctor's original plan. Is it wrong to go back to him to get his advice about her prescription? Am I *allowed* to go back to him and get a scrip? I feel badly for wanting a stronger effect / more medication.**   *These professionals are part of my college health system. The college is excellent in the medical field and I have had good experiences thus far.*  I saw **Dr. "Don"** (general practice doctor) to begin ADHD treatment. Ritalin did nothing. Adderall did nothing. I finally went up to 60mg/day on Adderall and began seeing improvements, but not much and not for every symptom. Hardly any side effects (not jittery, I can eat, I don't even feel it wear off except for becoming less focused). It's working well, but it doesn't seem like it's helping *much*.  **Dr. Don thought about starting me on Stratera in addition. He and I also thought it would be good to try to wean off my anti-depressant at this point, since I have found my anxiety source and am feeling a lot better. We didn't do this- just talked about it.**  Because 60mg/day is above the max, he needed to send me to the psychiatrist before deciding the next move. **Dr. "Joyce," who specializes in ADHD.**  He tells me she might want to keep me regularly until the medication is figured out. I am in her hands.  I met with Dr. Joyce today, and while I was nodding and agreeing in the meeting, I walked out feeling discouraged and uncertain about her decision.  * She's basically flabbergasted I'm hardly feeling my stimulant at such a high dosage. I felt like a medical marvel, or a mutant.  * She "hates" Adderall and wants me to consider Vyvanse or Concerta, because Adderall has the most abrupt onset and side effects (which I am not experiencing any of). * She doesn't want me to take Stratera on top of Adderall, she's a "less meds the better" kind of person. * "Meds won't open the book for you-" she stressed how strategies will fill in my gaps, which I get, but that's kind of what I've been trying to do my whole life to no avail. * She said there's no way to tell if it's really helping until school starts, though Dr. Don wanted it figured out BEFORE the stresses of school started. * She doesn't want me to stop taking my antidepressant anytime soon.  * **In conclusion: she prescribed me Adderall XR at 40mg/day for a month. My IR only lasted me 2-3 hours, so she thought long lasting would be better**. She said we needed to start with 40mg because she can't just start at 60mg (what I'm on now)- that's too far above the max.  So I'm to get the scrip, and report back to her in a month.  It all sounded fine during the time and then I thought...  &gt; *Wait, I'm getting LESS treatment when I went in saying it wasn't helping as much as I'd hoped? (we're talking as noticeable as a cup of coffee here)*  Her reason for a lot of the decisions were because of side effects when she knew I was experiencing hardly ANY?  **I feel like this might not help me more at all**. A month wasted? Not to mention the cost.  So, I'm tempted to schedule an appointment with Dr. Don for a "second opinion." I feel more comfortable with him, I trust him more, and his options made more sense to me. I have no idea if Dr. Joyce can "trump" him.  But am I being medication-greedy?   Will I ever get good treatment with such a high tolerance?  I know it objectively seems like I should trust the ADHD Psychiatrist. But... do I get the final say?  What will Dr. Don do if I tell him she disagreed with him and I like his idea better? Will he get in trouble?  CAN I even do this?  (They work in the same building, for clarification.)  ----   **TL;DR - High tolerance, so Adderall IR 60mg/day isn't overly helpful.**  **Doctor wanted to add another adhd med and get me off antianxiety pills, but sends me to psychiatrist first.**  **ADHD psychiatrist changes my dose to Adderall XR 40mg/day, tells me to stay on the antidepressant med, and that more strategies will do the rest.**  **I prefer the doctor's original plan.

On my days off work i like to lift some weights an hour after taking my dose when i get a rush from it going into my system, which my doc and i have come to the conclusion its because of my fast metabolism and my blood concentration of the drug goes down faster than normal. Anyways i know my limits as to not over exhert myself and strain something. But i really want to know if going on a 45 minute run would be ok or is it dangerous even though i know my limit since i was a 3 year varsity cross country runner in hs? I have looked it up and most say its bad because you can over-strain yourself and your cardio system.

March was the best I have ever felt in my life.  Being able to put in a normal day of work like everyone else was wonderful.  My thinking was so clear and I felt competent for the first time ever.  It was also a very emotional time, sometimes in a good way as I felt like I was finally the person I always wanted to be.  There were also times where I seemed to greave a life that could have been so much less painful.  By mid April I was back to my normal self.  My psychiatrist has increased my dose each month since then but it just isn't working.  I can't for the life of me understand how it could just stop working so quickly.  I'm going to see my psychiatrist next week and I hope he has other ideas than more Adderall.  I am desperate to feel competent and productive again.  I have tried to make nonmedical changes to help both daily routine and general health.  He had suggested I may want to try Ritalin next but why would that be any better.  If it did work well initially it seems likely that it would also loose its effectiveness in short order.  If I'm not going to feel like that again I actually wish I had never experienced it.  I had always accepted I would never be successful and that the patterns of failing would continue to the end.  I actually managed a grim acceptance of that fact.  When the Adderall was working I felt hopeful about my life for the first time.  If anyone has had similar experiences I'd love to hear about them...particularly if there is a happy resolution.  I've been trying to look into what the next approach should be but I'm lost.  tl;dr   Adderall worked great for 6 weeks then stopped helping and I would really appreciate guidance.

An anecdote.;;;Well, my partner and I have had suspicions about me for a while now, and today I finally had an evaluation with a psychiatrist, who has confirmed that I have ~~ADD. *(Yes, officially it's specifically 'ADD', as opposed to 'ADHD'. I assume that's still welcome here...)*~~ edit: I get it now. "Non-Hyperactive ADHD", I guess is the right way to phrase this?  All at once, my life seemed to click neatly into a repeating pattern of cycles. School reports with "has potential, but..." written all over them. Warnings. Missed deadlines. Distractedness and disorganisation. Getting behind with tasks, and that then bringing in anxiety and a sense of failure. It was both elating and completely horrifying. I genuinely don't really understand how this wasn't caught two whole decades ago.   When we finished our session, he wrote me a prescription, and we had a quick discussion about how it's a restricted substance, very important that I look after the script and, once I have them, the pills.   So... I headed to the chemist to fill the script, as you do, right? On the way, there was a store selling novelty cupcakes. **Ooh, shiny**.   Next thing you know I'm walking away from the shops carrying a box of cupcakes, and I've completely forgotten about going to the drugstore.   And all I could do was sigh, laugh out loud, and mutter to myself *"well... after today, at least now I know why I just did that".*    **TL;DR: Prescribed medication to help with ADD. Distracted by shiny things on way to drugstore. Forgot to pick up medication.**   Edit 2: [the shiny cupcakes](http://s3.amazonaws.com/foodspotting-ec2/reviews/3142335/thumb_600.jpg)

Do you think i should get diagnosed, is it expensive.  **I've always had these issues:**  * **Inability to pay attention** no matter how hard i tried.  * **Terrible concentration** and inability to stick to a task.  * An over active or **restless brain** that just won't stop.(Sorry if this one dosen't make much sense I find it hard to explain)  * An **inability to sit still** and relax.  * Always had the ability to do well, but could never focus or hand stuff in on time.  * Lose phones, keys and id's all the time.   * Constantly late for things. e.g miss bus or have to sprint to bus stop every morning.  * This list goes on, there so much more but i dont know which ones are related to ADD.   **So this is what i did:**  * Went to my GP for help and he refereed me to an educational psychologist because he said i was probably dyslexic.  * Did my assessment, **told I was dyslexic and possibly have ADD**.  * She said she **wasn't qualified to give me the diagnoses**. but she has helped people with learning difficulties before and said she could notice how difficult i was finding it to listen to her without getting distracted. She said i was constantly annoying her by drumming on the table and constantly moving and stretching.  * But she told me getting a diagnoses **might not be worth it** because there's **not much a psychologist can do to help**.  * But now i'm reconsidering it because I have **10 repeats in 20 days** and want all the help I can get.  * Plus i feel like ADD would be so relieving to be diagnosed with becuase **it would explain soooooooo much.**
738e7a2518237a99c21d9693eb3022a26f1e80b83c8a3cde919af237fa740c68;;;My dentist told me I'm clenching my jaw. Here's what we did next.;;;I was going to call this post "Fun With Bruxism", but that didn't seem like a very descriptive subject line.  **tl;dr** - bruxism (jaw clenching) is a possible side effect of stimulants. It can show up as a head and neck/shoulder pain, and you might not have any pain in your jaw or even notice that you’re clenching your teeth (at least at first.) If you’re having headaches and neck pain a lot, talk to your dentist and to the doctor who  prescribes your ADHD meds about the possibility that you're clenching your jaw. If you're having persistent pain in your jaw, **get yourself to a dentist ASAP**. This symptom has a lot of possible causes, and none of them are things you want to mess around with.   Last week I started having some pretty bad pain in my jaw near my back teeth. My first assumption was that my wisdom teeth were coming in, so I went in to see my dentist. He poked around in my mouth, moved my jaw in different ways and noticed it was making a slight clicking noise, and said that it’s probably bruxism. He gave me a list of instructions for how to treat it on my own, and told me to call him in two weeks and let him know how it went.  The thing I want to emphasize is that up until this happened, I wasn’t aware that I was clenching my jaw at all. I tend to get headaches in the afternoon, and before now I just assumed that it was my medication wearing off, but right around the time my jaw started hurting they got a lot worse (to the point that Aleve + Tylenol barely took the edge off) and starting showing up around the clock. It turns out that [tension in your jaw can cause headaches](http://www.migrainetrust.org/factsheet-jaw-tension-in-migraine-and-headaches-10889), as well as pain in your neck and shoulders (two other things I’ve had problems with, and which I’d previously attributed to working at a computer all day.)  Below are the home treatment suggestions my dentist gave me to follow for the next two weeks. Most of them are pretty non-invasive and safe, but if you have *any* questions about anything, ask your dentist and/or your doctor.  1. **Keep your teeth apart.** If your teeth aren’t touching then they can’t clench. This is simple but not easy - I’d gotten used to holding my teeth together by default, and forcing my muscles to do something they weren’t used to was pretty painful (but the next two steps helped with this). If you have any questions about proper jaw posture, ask your dentist. 2. **Use warm wet compresses on your jaw.** A paper towel run under a warm faucet is just fine.My dentist recommended doing this for about five minutes as often as possible, up to once an hour during the day if need be. I’ve been doing it every couple of hours during work breaks. 3. **Take over-the-counter anti-inflammatory meds.** Specifically, I’m supposed to take them consistently (so that it’s always in my system) for at least two weeks, even if my jaw isn’t hurting. This is something you definitely should **discuss with your doctor before you try it**, because using NSAIDs on the regular carries its own risks. 4. **Don’t open your mouth any wider than your thumb**. The way my dentist explained it, opening your mouth wide causes your jaw muscles to tense, and we’re trying to keep them from doing that as much as possible for a while. This may not be necessary or helpful for everyone  - ask your dentist. 5. **Eat soft-ish food in bite-sized pieces.** Related to the above, my food has to be smaller that my thumb. I’m also supposed to avoid biting down and tearing food with my teeth as much as possible. This means no crusty bread or raw veggies, no chewing gum, no tough meats/meat-like things (which I mention because I’m a vegetarian), and I have to be the snooty asshole who eats his pizza with a knife and fork for a while. It’s annoying, but it’s all to give my jaw muscles a break. As with step #4, this might be overkill for some people. **Ask your dentist**. 6. **Sleep on your back if you can.** Other positions can force your teeth together, which is exactly what we don’t want. This was definitely the worst one for me, but it also seemed to help a lot. I managed to get through all of last night without flipping over. Even though it was really uncomfortable and I’m pretty sure I got less actual sleep than when I’m on my side, I *still* felt a lot better and more rested than I normally do. If you’ve got issues with sleep apnea or something else that makes it difficult to sleep on your back, **talk to your doctor**.  I cannot overemphasize that you should **talk to your doctor and/or dentist** if you think you’re having this problem. I’m only describing my own case and what’s worked for me. So far I’m seeing some pretty solid improvement with the above measures, but you may not need to do everything I’m doing, or you may need to do other things like adjust your medication or wear a night guard. I can’t answer questions about what degree and type of treatment will be necessary or helpful for you.

Ever since I realized I had a problem with my everyday life I went straight to a reddit sub asking for some advice, I asked why I had such a struggle getting my school or chores etc done or what usually happens, starting those responsibilities. After I explained myself they said I could have ADD/ADHD, now I've heard of these disorders but honestly didn't know what they actually where. I looked them up and started connecting the dots from all my years at school and which lead up to me getting pulled out of school for homeschooling this year.  So fast forward to here, now I've been diagnosed for a few months with an attention deficit disorder. Things have been alright but I still feel like a fraud, like I'm just lazy and want to get my responsibilities done with little effort and let the drug do the work. Yet at the same time I really don't feel like a fraud, I just have no proof that I have a problem because nobody without the disorder has walked in my shoes.   How do you all overcome this, that you actually do have a disorder but can't explain to anyone how it is living with it? I think that's the reason I feel like a fraud because I can't prove anyone wrong when they just call me lazy or just want an edge over someone who doesn't take a stimulant. I do know that I have a problem but just can't describe it or give proof, and when I can't do that I feel guilty.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Social skills ( being too naive );;;I was recently diagnosed with ADHD. And one part of my life I have never understood is that why I am so naive . Let me share one of MANY MANY experiences . Once my friend said lets hang out at my apartment building . I was cool with that as I thought hanging out would be Playing video games, having a few beers etc ... Next day my friend arrived with his another friend ( i had no idea who the fuck he was)  I showed them my apartment and told them be comfortable and that I'll be back after a shower ( as I cleaned my whole apartment that day .. Thanks to my ADHD it has always been a mess ) . The moment I came out of shower. One of my rooms was locked from the inside and knocked several times and when he opened the door.. I was shocked these 2 filthy b******s were smoking pot are you kidding me that could have got me arrested .. Is that relatable ??
c87cdd029890f05319faf3a90ca74a7ee0e16138d7a068f1fdb2f7181f4427cf;;;Admitting to your doc part drug use;;;So I'm considering going to get checked out. I'm 25 and I've always known something wasn't quite "normal" about me, but always figured that's just how I was. My girlfriend and I were talking a few weeks ago about my short temper and how I've always gotten so easily frustrated over every little thing and it can set me off.. I've tried working on my anger and frustration my whole life all sorts of different ways.. I'm surprised she's still stuck with me through all my shit. Lol She suggested maybe it wasn't normal and I should look into it.   Somehow I ran across someone saying this could be a sign of adult ADHD, and as soon as I started looking into it, it was like a lightbulb went off in my head. Literally every thing about it described my life down to a tee. And my mom is the same way.   Back through highschool and until I was 22 I did a lot of partying and stupid shit. Experimented around with lots of substances. MDMA was my favorite. Made a lot of "impulse" decisions.. Thankfully I didn't get addicted to anything and i don't mess with any of that any more. I don't even smoke pot any more. I went back to school and I should be graduating next year..  I'm wondering if it gets brought up at the psychiatrist if I should admit to it. I don't want him to think I'm just some junkie and I'm just there to try to get drugs.. I just know my life seems a little more difficult than most for no reason.. And if I do have ADHD, I don't want my past stupid decisions to affect my chances of getting some much needed help..   **TLDR: Should I tell doc about past drug use if it isn't an issue any more? And what are yalls experiences?**
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;I hate myself so much;;;I'm so stupid. I'm not smart, never tried to be or pretended to be. I work as a pool attendant at a resort. I really like my job and I get to meet some cool people but I make a lot of mistakes. One of my first days there my boss asked me to move a huge ass box of hot dog buns into the food shed. I just tossed them into the food shed, didn't even think to put them in the fridge. A couple days later my boss told me she had to throw them all out because they got all stale and gross and because I didn't put them in the fridge. Fuck. I make a lot of mistakes like these, my boss is super nice and is understanding, but even she has her limits. We have a log book at work so people who work different shifts can communicate with each other, and it's not uncommon for something to be written in there about something bad that I did or something that I was supposed to do but didn't.    I come into work this morning and say "Hey guys" and my boss and coworker just ignore me. I open up the logbook thing we have and see a page long note saying something along the lines of "the pool deck was a mess and someone left the freezer door open and $200+ of stuff had to be thrown away. Fuuuuuckkkk.     I remember leaving work at 10:30 and stopping before I left the pool deck to ask myself if I forgot anything. I had my keys wallet and phone I remembered to clean and cover up the grills. The deck looked really nice to me. I was actually proud of myself when I left because for the first time I felt like I actually did everything I was supposed to.     You guys wanna know why I left the freezer open? I grabbed myself an ice pop when I went into the food shed to turn the music off. A mother fucking ice pop. And I forgot to close the freezer. How much stupider can I get?     I mentioned to my coworker today that last night coworker xyz jumped into the pool and chilled there so it was pretty  much me closing. I didn't really mean anything by it, I was just making small talk. She looks at me and says "tell [boss] What you just told me"     My coworker told me that my ass was on the line and that my boss had been talking shit about me and how I was lazy and never do anything all day and that I was probably gonna get fired. I told her I'm not gonna get my coworker fired but she went up to my boss and told her about how my coworker last night got into the pool so I had to close by myself.    My boss came up to me earlier and asked me how I was feeling, and she asked if I was comfortable with moving to the morning shift and getting to work at 7 am. I know why she's doing that, she wants someone who isn't a dipshit to close. I usually close by myself or with one other person so she'll probably switch me out with someone who is actually capable of doing their job. She wants me to work the morning since that's when the most people work and there's less of a chance for me to fuck shit up.     I'm just at work right now feeling like shit and hating myself. I deserve this feeling. I feel like I just got my coworker fired.
4ae67c016f7547c58ee02e949d5f02bb7763a917b3f0a73a51434de5219af03f;;;I apologized to everyone I know on Facebook last night. I wanted to share it with the world, so here I am.;;;(I wrote the following over the course of about 5 hours, multiple beers, too many smokes, and 1000 or so tears. I posted it in the middle of the night as soon as it was finished.)   I've been trying to work up the courage to post these thoughts for some time. It's been in my head for a long while, but this is the first time I've been able to hold it together long enough to type anything out. Here goes...  ------  I'm sorry. I must apologize to you.  Yes.  You.  If you still see what I post on Facebook, you're on the list, everyone who doesn't is still on the list, they just won't see this and I get to live with that and it sucks.  I am sorry. Truly.  I found a way to hurt you. Each and every one of you. Most of you don't even know it, and I'm sorry.  Knowing me has been something too many people for far too long have suffered through. I've been awkward, uncomfortable and even toxic in some circumstances. A small doses person. Maybe if we squeeze him out of the conversation circle he'll get the hint and just go away person. It's not that easy to deal with me the way I've been, and I'm sorry.  There are a few very good reasons for that.  You.  Yes you. Still on the list, don't know me. Seriously you don't.  Doesn't matter if you've known me for twenty minutes, or twenty years. You don't know me. I hid something from you, and I am sorry.  I don't know me.  I don't know me, so you can't and I am sorry.  I have a problem. Several in fact. Big fucking problems. Problems even bigger than your mom. They've hurt you, each and every one of you, in some way, and I'm sorry.  The first, is that the single most difficult thing for me to do in the world, out of all things possible, is ask for help. For anything. For any reason. For as long as I can remember.  Asking for help has always been, irrationally I know, worse than failure in the experience of the universe as seen from trapped inside my head. As early as I can remember I've needed, more been compelled, to figure it out on my own. Whatever it was. No matter the cost. I hurt people by not listening or taking their advice and I'm sorry.  Second, I can't pay attention. Not easily anyway. It's like making the tightest fist you can all day and being a failure every time you stop. Haven't been able to since you met me. The rest of humanity thinks too slow to stay focused on without getting bored and distracted. You've always been that way. So have I. It's not a good thing when you think so fast you can't even make sense to yourself. I've forgotten your name, things you said, stories you told, things I told you I would do, times, dates, places, plans, goals, to reply to your email, text, or phone call. Most likely multiple times. I have an actual medical problem with it. I cannot control how much information, relevant or not, my brain chooses to try to process at the same time and it regularly overloads itself and I lose important things forever. I went undiagnosed for 25+ years and unmedicated for at least ten after that. Some of you may not be aware of that until now, and for that I am sorry.  I used number three because of number one, to hide number two. I know this one,  and the fourth one hurt you, that is something I know for a fact. For these, I will understand if "I'm sorry" will never do, and you never want to be near me again. That is the price of where I went and coming back the way I did. I know that and I am sorry.  Four: severe depression over two and three because of one.  I'm talking bad. Very bad. A deep dark hole more miserable than most of you can imagine is a possible place to go, inside your own head bad, bad. No description of any form of hell was this bad, bad. It was a place of bad so horrible, it's as hard to describe as yellow is to someone born blind. You. Can't. Even. The only way you could know is if you went there yourself, and I'd never wish that on anyone. Ever. If you understand I'm sorry you went there too.  A very large portion of any time anyone has spent with me in the last 10 years or so was while I was in this hole, digging myself very slowly ever deeper. I avoided interaction with you because I felt bad, I would make promises I knew I would not keep because I felt bad. In my quest to get out of this hole of horrible, without asking for help, I hurt you through my behavior, and I am sorry. This time for both of us.  Because four caused three to flourish. A seed that should never have been allowed to germinate, and I am sorry.  Number three is the worst of them all. This kills all relationships of any kind. This is where forgiveness ends, and I am sorry.  Three. I have become a very good liar. Extremely good. Very hard to lie to me good. Oscar worthy lying if it was my job good. Like, hide severe depression because of being unable to ask for help with your ADD from everyone you know without most of them finding out for 30+ years until you finally told them yourself just now because it all has to collapse, good. I've said or done just about anything for a very large number of years to hide how bad these things made me feel. I lied to hide the pain from you and everyone else I know, and I'm sorry.  It's a very bad habit, lying, because it hurts people and, like anything you practice, it gets easier. Easier to do and easier to justify. I can't count the number of times I've lied to your face. Sometimes I didn't even have to and I did anyway.  Yes. Your. Face.  I've stood in front of you, looked you in the eye, and lied to you and you believed it.   I've lied to you. I have. It wasn't a white lie either.  I lied to you so I didn't admit I needed help. I lied to you because I forgot. I lied to you to avoid getting yelled at, I lied to you because I felt bad, and I lied to you to try to protect you, all of you, from that place I was in. I lied to you because it became the easier story to tell, so easy I could have a lie to you out of my mouth before I realized I did it.  I have lied to so many people, for so long, about so many things, the balance in my bank account of how much I can be trusted is a very large negative number, and I am sorry.  I apologize to everyone.  My wife. My family. My friends. Acquaintances. Everyone.  I am sorry I shat on your trust and your love. I'm sorry I couldn't trust you enough with my pain. I've permanently destroyed things I will forever regret. Anything not permanently destroyed is severely harmed. If nothing survives I understand and I'm sorry.  The fog of misery, and too much info in my head to process is just starting to lift, clearest I've been since as long as I can remember.  I broke. I got so bad I broke myself. I got to a place where I had finally gotten so bad I knew I had no choice and I did the unthinkable and terrifying thing. The last, worst option. I asked for help.  I violated the stupidest rule I couldn't shake for anything.  It's been the best worst most painfully regretful thing I've ever done. I'm finally on some medication that is actually working in a way I can only describe as "positive" which is still a foreign language. I'm going to a therapist as well. Help is actually helping right now, maybe.   I'm thinking clearer than I have in as long as I can remember, and I'm horrified at what I've done. Absolutely and totally appalled at my behavior. Toward all of you. For so many, many years.  I've destroyed the most important things in my life, pretty much categorically and systematically, not alphabetically though. I've alienated myself from family and friends to the point where I'm a myth to some people, and an uncomfortable experience to be around for the rest. I've lied to just about everyone I know to hide my pain. I've let people think I'm an asshole and let relationships die to hide it. I hurt you, and I'm sorry.  I'm on medications that seem to be helping but I'm not even close to better, not by a long shot. I'm still probably almost as bad as you've ever felt, maybe worse, and yet that is an improvement for me. I can't expect you to understand, better is relative, I guess. I've wrecked everything good about my life and the hole I dug is infinitly worse than I could see while I was digging, but it's somehow less bad than before things started clearing and I was at the bottom of it. I hope I've stopped digging. Go figure, medical science ftw.  The future is almost as foggy as the rest used to be. There is a lot I don't know.  I don't know what I can do when I don't feel bad.  I don't know what I can do when I can pay attention.  I don't know what I can do when I don't have to lie.  I don't know what I can do when I can ask for help.  I sure as hell don't know what I can do when I can do all of that at the same time.   I don't know me.   You don't know me, because you can't.  Yet.  I do know who you met isn't the real me. No one has met that person.  I do know the person I was before I climbed into the hole was too young to form a guess about who I am able to be.  I do know that I don't like the person you met, and I'm not sure why you put up with him. Seriously.  I do know that the parts of me I'm getting to know are pissed at the person you met.  I do know that I hurt you.  Yes, you.  More than you'll ever know.  I know I behaved so poorly, toward so many people, for so long, that the two most important people can't forgive me for it.  I'm one of them.  I hurt you.  Yes you.  And you too.  And I am so very sorry for that.

Recently diagnosed (28) with ADD after making it through college and grad school. My new job really brought the symptoms to the surface so I sought help.   The doctor put me on Adderall 10 mg IR. I take one pill, twice a day.   It's totally wrecked by sleep. I was up until nearly 4 am last night. Finally fell asleep for a few hours and then had to get up. I took my first dose two hours later than usual, so I chose to half my second dose in the afternoon so I could sleep tonight. I checked with the pharmacist and he said it was fine.  Is this normal? I'm really over tired. I've seen the good that this medication can do. I just need reassurance. Thanks, guys.
704e9bf4093216f98c61b72ac0686188099bcdca2321f395737e7bf3f191c328;;;Feeling a weird sense of hope (long post);;;Summary up to this point: fiance kicked me out, took everything. Ta da.  This has been a very long road for me despite that it has only been three weeks. But it has been the most painful, sadness-filled, angry, and hopeless time in my life. I found out I have ADHD and depression during this time (shortly after my fiance left me). I learned that a lot of the problems I had (anger, sadness, lack of positive emotion, inability to connect, selfishness, and difficulty staying committed) were in someway shape or form related to or a byproduct of these new found diagnoses.   My porn addiction (/r/pornfree), alcohol abuse (/r/stopdrinking), the pain and torment I put her through, and my cheating ways pushed her away. And I would never once say to anyone that she made the wrong choice. But, nonetheless, it hurts immensely.   I just got on my meds recently (ADHD and depression) and I saw glimpses of the light through the darkness. And I feel differently than usual. I was susceptible to pain. I was weak again. I crumbled and cried. I experienced panic attacks from the pain. She was ruthless throughout the process. And I can explain it all and understand it all, but I just can't handle it emotional. It's the first time that I have been so emotionally present. And the poor guy shows up at the wrong time. To be beaten and hammered down so ruthlessly.  But, after about three weeks of it. I am finally starting to come to terms. It has taken a lot. I may lose my job because of how much time I have taken traveling to seek counseling and get properly medicated. And frankly, I would much rather lose my job and have to move back home than continue the path I was on. I can find another job. I can't change the pain I have caused for her. And I will make that sacrifice if need be to ensure that I never am that person again. Because I am worth becoming who I know I am capable of being. And that person is amazing. And that is what I want. And that, fellow readers, is why I am feeling weird. Weirdly positive. And that's okay.  TL;DR: Fucked my whole life up with bad choices, got my just deserves, felt hopeless, got my emotions put through a grinder, came out the other side and saw hope.
9ab096492b6266563de4a4137fafa186285b69d47e41543acde01431389d6429;;;I thought everyone's head were like mine.;;;Hello everyone.   (English is my second language, so if I have some bad grammar, bear with me, please)  I went to Doctor's office this Monday and possibly diagnosed with ADHD. I did not know about ADHD until this year (yes, this year). I am from South Korea when I was 16/17 in 2003/2004.  When I was young, I could not wait to speak when everyone was talking.  During the class, my mind of thinking about something else, like why is that clock tickling so loud? Why is that pencil sharpening sound so annoying? Like that. This was in middle school.  I tried everything -- piano, violin, ice staking, taekwondo, but mostly last less than a year.  In high school years, I had hard time organizing.  My room was mostly messy with host family, and I felt bad about it.  My planner was filled with everything such as homework, reading, sleep time, break time. When I compare with other students, they were just simple!  I loved books when I was young according to my parents.  However, since middle school, I had hard time finishing the book, even one chapter.  I finished about less than twenty books in my life time so far.  When we go to family gathering at a restaurant and I am done eating, I usually just get up and walk around.  I shake my legs, and my parents want me to stop shaking legs, but I can't help it.  When my girlfriend (first) dumped me earlier this year, I could not stop crying for about two weeks and had no appetite. One time, I fell down, thankfully I was with my friend. I could not control my emotion either.  I also have hard time concentrating more than ten minutes, and I thought everyone was like that.  When I see other students focus good, I thought I must be lazy, even though I try my best.  I also get distracted while I am writing this.  I prescribed with Adderall 5mg per day for 30 days.  I will get CT scan soon to get more diagnose.  The surprising part is that I got decent grades and failed only three class (including high school (it was AP)).  That holds me back if I am just lazy and easily get distracted.  I am trying my best, and I thought everyone's head same as mine.  TL;DR - I thought everyone was head was just like mine when I have so much going on in my head.  I am glad I found this forum. -MS

I received my diagnosis today!;;;After a decently prolonged series of appointments and tests, i finally heard back about my results. The final diagnosis both relieves much frustration, and saddens me simultaneously. But hell, ive finally gotten an explanation for just about all that have troubled me in my life!  Official diagnosis: *Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Predominately Innattentive Presentation, Moderate.*  Also, the Pyschologist noted that special consideration should be given to the possibility of General Anxiety Disorder, as he saw signs of that, but not enough for a formal diagnosis. So that was interesting.. Also a bit of OCD, but barely out of average limits.  So, anyways, thanks to /r/adhd. You guys were really what catapulted my endeavour to make sense of my world, and who i am. When i had a question, i secretly lurked in the shadows, gawked at your stories and how incredulously analogous they are to my own odyssey, and learned so much invaluable information -- all from one place!  Ill do my best to pay it forward..

I'm new at this so I'm not quite sure what comes next.    My psychologist hasn't issued any meds yet (he said the nurse practitioner who usually did had recently died of cancer).  Is there anything I should know or ask about when he does prescribe something?  Also, my testing took 7 hours (though the insurance company said that they would only cover 3) is this normal?  Or was this my psychologist's OCD acting up?  I had been planning to go back to school for creative writing (whatever this is that I have used to be far far worse, I've learned to cope with it over the years), will the meds affect my creativity?  Can anybody recommend any good books?  Is there anything else I should ask but haven't?

c6881191a4e2f80a2845d1debe2def76cc364b52edff614e256e80aa0f40ee98;;;I want help but I can't get myself to get help.;;;Background: I was diagnosed with ADHD at a young age, and I have been dealing with it most of life. For most of that time, I never really had an understanding of what that actually meant. When I was put on medication, my parents pretty much just gave pills and told me I had to take them. No other explanations added that I know of.  Started with Concerta, and somewhere along the line I switched to Adderall (I hated both). Growing up, I was the kid who sat in the back of the class and didn't really talk to anyone and I was picked on quite a bit. When I was 15, I thought that it was all the meds fault that I was this way. I got my parents to stop making me take them.  It helped slightly in the way that I was a little more social (also the Adderall made me very paranoid). But hurt in other ways like grades slipping, lack of control over my emotions, and I've also grown up with a lack of control over my thoughts as well.  Within the past year or so, I've been studying up ADHD and symptoms among other facts and it has given me a lot answers to questions that I've had for a long time. I believe that in addition to ADHD, I have depression and anxiety to go with it. Though, being enlightened can only help you so much.  I'm now 20 years old and started taking Vyvanse about 2 weeks ago, first medication in 5 years (30 mg). Has helped a bit though I'm not sure it's the medicine for me. I'm really considering going to counseling and have been for a while. My parents have given me the option but I can't seem to pull myself together to do it on my own. I make up excuses for not doing it, like I don't want to spend the money, I don't have the time, and to me the biggest one is that I want to get through this without the counseling. I've really been adamant about that last one. Hell, the only reason I started taking Vyvanse is because I had a talk with my parents about some of the difficulties I've been having and finally got them to agree that I needed real help and that I wasn't just being melodramatic.  I'm really hoping to hear some of y'alls opinions on this. I've posted here before but never my story. Any feedback is appreciated!

Since I was recently diagnosed with adhd I was wondering what the process is like when it comes to drug testing and if there's actually an unwritten stigma behind hiring people with adhd taking meds. What has your experience been like?

Can anyone provide a thought I may not have?;;;I feel like taking medicine is just looking for the easy way out of being a lazy, unmotivated bum. I know that's a common occurrence for people with ADHD, but I can't shake it. I constantly play devil's advocate on everything I hear or do, to the point where my friends and family just think I'm disagreeing with them, so nobody will give me any feedback. I'm hoping you guys can help me break the cycle one way or another. Basically, my thought process is as such:   * 1) I have all of the routines and symptoms. * 2) I've been diagnosed twice and the medication does help. * 3) But what if the doctor was wrong? ADHD is misdiagnosed all the time. * 4) Plus, I do pretty okay without medicine. * 5) But life is simpler and easy when I do have it. * 6) Life isn't supposed to be simple nor easy, quit being lazy. * 7) Repeat. * I hate everything.

Totally spaced on jury summons, what do?;;;I kept meaning to fill out my exemption form (I have children under twelve for whom I'm the primary caregiver) but instead it just sat in the car until yesterday, when I realized I was supposed to appear on the 14th!!! The paper said I'll face a fine of $100-$1000!!!! We totally can NOT afford this right now,  I'm freaking out. Do I have any leeway on this considering my failure to comply is 100% the fault of my stupid ADHD? Ugh, i feel like punching myself in the face for this!!
a026086cce99606b84a73fe0c8eed43ac001f09562483a21a09357736ee7ac5b;;;Referred to specialist, don't know how to approach the appointment.;;;So, in just under 2 weeks I have an appointment with a specialist, I've seems two doctors so far, one of which just sort of gave me what I wanted(a referral to a psychiatrist, the other seemed to be in agreement that I might have ADHD, however, I have a list as long as my arm of symptoms that may be considered to be symptomatic of ADHD(see below), and I kind of feel like if I list all of these symptoms then it will feel like I'm regurgitating a Google search for ADHD. Apart from that(this is my biggest issue) I have come from a family where the idea of mental illness is shunned/ignored/ridiculed, so I have always just got on with life, thinking that these 'symptoms' are just poor character traits, so I've learnt to just cope with stuff and get on with life, so I have a great amount of work experience for my age(7+ years at age 24), I make a good wage and I have a lot of 'friends' I'm lucky enough to be enthusiastic about a lot of stuff, generally cheerful and outgoing, so on the surface, I feel like, I look like a high-functioning human being, my concern is, I don't want this to affect my diagnosis, I may look whole on the outside, but there's a bunch of duct tape, rope and band aids holding everything together precariously.   Did this sort of thing worry any of you when being diagnosed? Did you tell the doctor/psych everything that was swirling around your head? Did you plan what you were and weren't going to tell them in advance? I feel like they might see me as someone just trying to get a Ritalin prescription, which is true, but it's not because I want to abuse/sell it, I just want to feel like a normal person feels, so I can get on with my life academically(3 years learning to program, still not at Junior programmer level).  I just feel so anxious, it doesn't help that I've pushed through the last 6 weeks of work because of how busy we are and not wanting to let my department down, instead of taking the time off as my doctor advised.  Tiredness Forgetfulness Impatience Anger management issues Stress &amp; Anxiety Constant feeling of underachievement Loudness(I speak so loud that when I try to whisper, people in other rooms can hear me.) Interrupting other people Stubborn I talk too much, in too many words, I never feel like the other person has fully understood me. Terrible lack of concentration I jump from hobby to hobby I figit, I shake my leg sometimes, but mostly, I bite nails, the skin around my nails, I tap and chew pens, I pick scabs. I avoid complex tasks for fear(and expectation) of failure. Poor hand writing Trouble reading(read a total of about 3 books in my life, all of which I huperfocused on due to the story) Terrible academic record, underachieved through to the legal age to drop out and dropped out of school. I demand constant instant gratification, I cannot abide waiting for things.(my partner can't tell me she has received gifts for me before the relevant date(bday/xmas) as it drives me crazy knowing its being withheld until X date for practically no reason) Poor money management. I don't take concequences into account before taking action. I solve problems with short term solutions constantly, without ever fixing the problem outright.  In addition complex/technical music is cathartic for me, which isn't a symptom, just a relevant trait.  TL;DR: appointment for diagnosis soon, how should I approach telling the doctor about myself/my issues?  Sorry for the wall of text. &lt;3 Smiles.

Is disclosing ADHD to my boss a bad idea?;;;I've always been horrible at procrastination and meeting deadlines, but managed to get a decent job b/c the work I eventually turn in is good. My time-management issues have stopped me from advancing in my career, but I think my supervisor has finally lost his patience with me. He told me he needs a plan from me of how I am going to better manage my time so this won't continue happening . I think if I don't give him a satisfying answer I'll be one step away from getting fired (which would be totally reasonable for him to do—I've given more than enough cause over the years).  I'm currently on 20mg vyvanse (and thinking of going up to 30) which has been a subtle help and started seeing an adhd coach a month ago. I'm also in the process of finding a therapist to start seeing weekly. So that's my real plan to improve time management. But I don't know if that's what I should say. I don't want my boss to think I'm giving an excuse or expecting special treatment.  Since starting treatment I've become better at organization, at doing small chores and responding to work emails in a timely manner. I also think I'm starting to get better at not hiding when I've missed a deadline. But it feels like chipping away at this huge stumbling block, and my ability to focus and buckle down hasn't gotten much better. With the help of the ADHD coach, I'm starting to use timers to get me to start working, but I don't think that strategy has made a difference yet.   [In case it's relevant , my psychiatrist only gave me an informal diagnosis, and I have not been tested. So I don't have any documentation.]  Tldr: my boss wants me to give him a plan for how I will fix my time management and stop missing deadlines. Can I tell him "I have been diagnosed with adhd and have begun treatment and have hired an organization coach—these are the steps I've taken to fix the problem, and expect gradual results over the next few months." Or is there another alternative?

Am I expecting too much to think this could be the "first day of the rest of my life?";;;I finally decided to have a real talk with my doctor and we both decided it was time to try medication.  I was apprehensive at first, because I'm very sensitive to medications.  I can't even take cold medicine for adults without feeling really weird.  Now, I'm so excited to try this.  I feel like I might finally be able to function like a real person for the first time.  Am I building up my expectations too much?  I'm starting out on a low dose, then will build up in a month, if appropriate.  I suppose I'm looking for other's experiences when first beginning a new medication for ADHD as an adult.

I was diagnosed with ADHD at age 13 after being "forced" to see a child psychiatrist by my mother, i was so angry with this, I barely finished the session and was grumpy throughout. At the time, i wasn't very self aware, I didn't see anything wrong with my behaviour so I refused to go back to the therapist or take medication of any kind, I took it as an insult. Whenever my mother would speak to my school teachers and they'd talk about my behaviour and their concerns with me present, I felt like I was being cheated and lied about which would result in me storming off in anger every single time without fail.  In the last few years, i've become consciously aware of myself and my actions, I understand a lot more about responsibilities and accountability and I am well behaved. I was a nightmare in my childhood, as well as having ADHD, I have ODD (oppositional defiance disorder) which is common for people with ADHD. This made things a lot more difficult for me in the long run with regards to school and run-ins with the police (from age 11 onwards). I was extremely hyper active and "trouble seeking", hitting classmates was a normal thing for me (to this day I cannot understand the logic behind this) which tapered off during my high school years. I was constantly reminded that I had all of this potential that I intentionally wasn't putting to use. I would argue with teachers about their punishments for my behaviour every time I got into trouble, which would result in harsher punishments. I refused to follow the rules mostly because I despised the rule makers and didn't see the point in their rules or the importance of school work. To this day, people of authority are more rage inducing than anything to me. As an adult, i've failed in college multiple times, I did well in my GCSE's only because you could get away with knowing very little in high school and still pass with good grades. I didn't pay attention in class nor did I do any work at home, but in the rare instance that I did do my work in class, I absorbed information quickly and this was enough to get by. The moment I began classes in college, I knew I was doomed, school had always been a burden for me but this was different, there was so much planning required for large projects and research to be done for weekly assignments, nobody to monitor you like they did in high school, I felt completely alone. It was extremely overwhelming and I hated every moment of it. As you can probably guess, the only way I completed my assignments was handing them in last minute because when the pressure is on, my mind starts working all of a sudden and realises the importance of the situation. This continued until the end of the academic year. I got my test results, and much to my dismay, I failed every class.  The following year I went to a different college and took a completely different course, it was business oriented, which seemed to fit me a little better. I was still struggling to get my work done (or attend the college daily for that matter) and was only capable of doing my assignments under pressure. This method worked for me until the end of the academic year whereby the workload became too much to handle, this time was different, my mind was in overdrive, more so than usual, I cracked, I just left college and never returned. That was a little over three years ago. I've since enrolled in other courses and quit within the month because of how helpless and depressed it made me feel, so much anxiety and hopelessness, any time I tried to start an assignment, suicide was my immediate thought, it just seemed easier.  As you can imagine, I feel completely demoralised and dejected and lack any purpose whatsoever. I went from being an extremely confident person (somewhat cocky as well) to a person who constantly doubts himself and isn't sure of himself, I have very low self esteem which has stopped me from pursuing relationships with the opposite gender despite being in shape and receiving quite some attention from the females back in college, it doesn't help me feel any better. The only time I feel somewhat happy is when i'm with friends, most of whom have left the city to work/study abroad and the ones that remain either work full time or are actively looking for jobs or working on their masters degree, so i don't see my friends very often. I live with my parents and i'm not very productive. Depression and anxiety have taken over my life to an incessant degree which has resulted in derealisation (which is quite terrifying in and of itself). Awful sleep quality for the last few years has only made things worse (probably due to anxiety &amp; depression) and the cycle continues . Nothing motivates me, the one good thing I have going for me is making a habit out of going to the gym, I have a decent amount of prior experience which made it an easier habit to form, too bad it doesn't improve my sleep and I feel awful waking up each day. Sorry for rambling, I had to get this out, i've written long posts in the past and decided they weren't worth anyone's time, this one may not be any different. I don't know what to do anymore, or so it seems.

They have claimed that over the past 1.5 years (coincidentally the duration of our relationship), they haven't been able to perform up to their potential/expectations in college, and now in the workplace.   They've functioned as a high performer in school their whole life - they made a top university, achieved good grades, landed an amazing and impressive job. Now, they seem insecure that they can't achieve what is expected of them, both by themselves, and by their peers/managers.   My take - I've honestly been pretty ignorant of mental health diagnoses. Right or wrong, I believe that we live in an era of over-diagnoses. I understand that's not a popular opinion, and I don't mean to offend anyone with my beliefs.   As it pertains to my SO, I feel as though they are taking a shortcut/cheating. They can't perform well at work, and want to take a magic pill in order to get them to where they want to be. I disagree with that with every fiber of my existence.   Furthermore, I'm absolutely terrified of the pill itself. I'm not at all comfortable with it's likeness to meth. I don't like the idea of reliance. I feel that once they go down the road, how can you ever decide to not take it anymore? They claim they're going to go month-to-month, but I frankly don't believe it.    They're scared to tell their parents, for fear of disapproval or being labeled as having ADHD for life... But isn't that exactly what comes with the territory if you are going to be taking the medication? Am I crazy to think that even they might think there's something immoral/wrong if they are hiding it from their parents?   Please help. I know that I am pretty ignorant. Help me be better.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;[meta] there are no adults;;;I don't know when but somewhere around the age of 18 I realized that adults aren't in control. They don't know everything.  They too get scared. They too fail. That made me feel like the world is unsafe. That nobody is in control. But I dealt with it. And I was okay with it after a while.   When I was diagnosed with ADHD at 31 I sort of felt the same way. Because I started looking into the statistics of mental health, and as it where a surprisingly large part of the worlds population have some sort of mental disorder, condition or problem. We're all mad. Or at least, most of us aren't normal. Which is a paradox I guess. Anyway.   My point, or the lesson I learned rather, is that no matter how safe and secure "the others" seem to be, it usually turns out that they are just as scared (and mad) as you. Their confidence and sanity is your illusion.   Or, that's my impression and experience at least. Hopefully it could serve as motivation or at least comfort to someone else.

At 25 I have decided to try vyvanse because I start uni in a few months.   I've been on 30 mg for three weeks now and firstly I really like it. The sort of speedy feeling went away after a few days and I'm finding myself more able to concentrate, more productive and actually muchless depressed. Maybe being able to get out of bed to run errands and clean my appartment has improved my self esteem. I can be a little zombie like at the end of the day but it's a great improvment over the mood swings (I think my BF appreciates it too)  One thing- The dr weighed me before writing the  scipt - 5'6 122 pounds. Today I clock in at 140. Almost 20 pounds in three weeks! I knew I was gaining cause none of my clothes fit. I don't THINK I have been eating more or worse. I don't ever feel hungry, I just eat three meals a day so I don't crash. I even have been good about cooking lots of veggies with dinner. I work in a health food store and used to snack on the bulk stuff all day. Now I don't even think about food. I did used to skip breakfast often but now I eat two eggs with brown toast cause the vyvanse makes me feel bad on an empty stomach.   I've been too the gym 5 times in the last 3 weeks and I think I had the energy to give it more of a go than ussual. I also started delivering veggies on a bike trailer once a week so I figure that's extra exercise. Plus I have always walked to and from work.  One other thing, the vyvanse increased the amount of cigerettes I smoke. Maybe that's it?  Anyway, my dr assured me I'm still a healthy weight but if this keeps up I'll have to stop vyvanse and I'm having a positive experience with it overall

This is usually a good thing, but sometimes I end up with people with more problems than I can handle. The worst part is that I find it stimulating at first, and being supportive is easy. The problem is that it gets to a point where I dread contact because I know that sooner or later something bad happens. And being supportive gets really hard.   The only solution I've found is to be less social, and gradually cut contact. Preferably before I dread talking to them in fear of more bad news. I feel really bad, but it ends up being toxic for me. I try to be honest, but that usually means blunt, and I'm not surprised that I come off as mean.   How is this adhd related? Well, I read somewhere that we often uncritically seek contact, and miss the warning signs. Does anyone else have similar experiences?   Tl;Dr I befriend people with more problems than I can handle, and I don't realise it until I'm waist deep.

I don't know if it's going to work.;;;Hello all,   I just want to say I really appreciate anyone who can share their 2 cents. I started taking Vyvance yesterday for an undetermined but everlasting case of ADHD. (I say undetermined because my diagnosis was a very short appointment, but I say everlasting because I'm certain that I have an attention deficiency). MY QUESTION: Is it normal to feel no benifets and simply be jittery the first few days of starting up? I've heard that if it only makes you jittery, then it won't help you. I spoke with my pharmacist and he said that my body is probably just adjusting to having the amphetamine in it and that it may even take up to a couple weeks to see results.   I'd love to hear some first hand experiences on what you guys went through. Any help is greatly appreciated, thanks!

Before then, I knew I always had attention problems because studying and paying attention in class was always an extreme challenge for me. Somehow I managed to pull off a 2.9 gpa the prior semester even with my horrendous attention span and lack of motivation, which (in my opinion) is pretty good for someone with terrible attention. I think it's because I really did give it my all... it was just my adhd that was hindering me. As a result, I proactively went out and got tested and medicated. The following semester I worked with the same ethic as I had in the first school semester. However, the results differed significantly. I ended the semester with a 3.8 gpa compared to my previous 2.9. Almost a whole point difference. I am just astonished how much vyvanse has helped me. Hopefully the effects won't fleet anytime soon.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Had a row with my boyfriend yesterday and he said "You literally cannot cope with anything". I know he's right. How does AD(H)D affect your relationships?;;;Hi guys! I feel so frustrated this week. I feel like I'm running out of options and things to try and I just can't seem to turn myself into a functioning adult, no matter how hard I try. I'm sure it will get better eventually but I just need to vent.  **some context** I was diagnosed with ADD only recently (I'm a female in my mid20s). Before this I had a history with stimulant abuse (amphetamine). I used stimulants solely for productivity and mood-stabilization so when I sought help my therapist referred me for an ADD test and the results were very obvious. It came as a surprise to me; I've always just thought that I was simply a malfunctioning adult for some reason.   **The issue** I just moved in with the boyfriend. Before this we had a long distance relationship. I thought moving in together would drastically improve my symptoms because it means I have a more settled lifestyle and don't have to travel every weekend.   In fact, it has been a frustrating experience. Because we've only recently moved I spend most of my days (when I don't work) in an unfinished house which makes things a lot worse for me. In stead of having a day off I set myself high goals in the morning "I want to unpack this, organize this, paint that" etc. When I don't manage (and I never do, really) my inner monologue becomes more and more negative.    In addition; i don't even know what it's like to have a nice day off by myself. I don't have the patience to watch a film, I don't have the discipline and motivation to get into a hobby. I don't actually have any hobbies I can partake in when I'm at home. I just browse the internet all day (hello there 12 google chrome tabs) and do useless shit.   By the time boyfriend comes home in the evening I am an emotional frustrated mess. I feel guilty because 1. I am so tired emotionally that I feel like I can't be the enthusiastic upbeat girlfriend anymore and 2. because he comes home to a house that is still unfinished. What am I even supposed to tell him about my day "I wanted to do this but then I couldn't manage and just sat on the sofa for an hour feeling bad and stroking the cat".   From this point on I just cannot seem to have a nice evening anymore. It's not like I'm horrible to him but whenever something really insignificant goes wrong, for example when I'm cooking dinner and something falls on the floor, I'll have a mini breakdown. I don't get violent but a lot of swearing happens and I always feel really embarrassed afterwards about being a grown woman who can't even control her own emotions even just a little. I just feel so overwhelmed all the time by the most mundane things.   Boyfriend is now here to witness it all, whereas before, when I still lived on my own, I was the only person bothered by it. I go to therapy and I just recently started concerta 32mgs but on most days I'm still miserable. Me and my boyfriend had a row yesterday and in his anger he told me "fun fact, you literally cannot cope with ANYTHING and I find it so goddamn frustrating". It hurt. Not only because it's the truth but also because I'm inconveniencing the person I love the most.  I just want to function. I just want to do normal day-to-day things without it being so tiring that I give up on them altogether. I want to have a nice house. I want to stop procrastinating.  So... Please tell me it gets better? I'd be curious to hear if anyone experiences the same relationship challenges. At least I won't feel so alone eh?
6eea9b6afe0c0678cc7688081d3070ac938c1ecdde132b8dc52a4c1e5db43721;;;Almost a year on Vyvanse, successful thus far;;;Last year I started what is only my second full-time office job. Prior to that my life was filled with frequent moves around the country and frequent changes of job from one retail job to the next, from gas stations to big-box stores.    I won't go that far back though... That's a whole other can a worms...    Anyway! Around this time last year I was afraid of losing that job, afraid of losing the financial stability, afraid of my future and chances of having a quality life.  My work was suffering, my home life was suffering, my relationships were suffering.  I couldn't focus, my quick flights to anger and frustration became more frequent, which increased my frequency of guilt and sorrow over it all. How could I treat the ones I love this way? What would I do if I lost my job? If I can't get through this job, what does it mean for the next job? If I can't keep a full-time job with good pay and benefits, how will I ever be anything but a burden to those I love?    I couldn't focus, I was lost in the thoughts that bounced around in my head, I had extreme difficulties keeping up with all the notes I had to write at work just to barely make it through the work day, I would forget to feed the kitties, I'd get absolutely nothing done because every two seconds I wanted to do something new! Needless to say, I was in a bad place.    Luckily through some research online, talking to 2 people in my very small network of friends, and encouragement from my boyfriend; I sought out help.    It wasn't going to be easy of course, my parent's opinion and the way I was brought up, would weigh heavily upon my chest. It was hard to think of seeing a doctor, but I did. Just calling a doctor was hard, picking up the phone and deciding that now, now was my time and now I needed help and now I would address this and with help fix this. I made the appointment a month out because I was still scared.    The month passed by and I educated myself as much as I could, through this subreddit, documentaries, papers, TedTalks, those 2 close friends, while I told my family nothing and my boyfriend everything.   I went in to the doctor, and was lucky to find someone trustworthy and understanding. I told him my issues and how my work life was now being effected, that I couldn't cope anymore on my own - all the lists in the world wouldn't save me - and after lengthy questioning he diagnosed me with ADHD.    The next two months(mid aug - mid oct 2014) I was on only Ritalin and it was awful, so terrible, I was still quick to frustration and anger - more so than before - and was experiencing terrible head aches. Things were worse, I'd lost hope, with so many other options out there for what could help it felt overwhelming.    My doctor and I concluded that Ritalin just wasn't an option.    He started me on Vyvanse and monitored me closely. At first it was amazing, the initial two weeks on Vyvanse even at a low dose was incredible! I was so excited, then half the benefits had faded. My boyfriend still encouraged me to continue, to keep trying. I kept going back to the doctor's appointments and over time my dose was upped to 40mg Vyvanse.    My dose has not changed since February of this year, I was able to keep my job, my home life is good and stable, my relationship with my boyfriend is stronger than ever, I was able to admit to my parents that I had ADHD which to my surprise they accepted (our family has a history of different mental issues, but it was always hush-hush and shameful, mental disorders were laughed at just the way the media in the US has liked to do for so long), even our pets are happier!    Don't misunderstand what I say though, things are not all better and my life is not all pots of gold and kitties and rainbows and I wouldn't want to give that impression. I still have to make greater efforts to remember and stay focused than if I didn't have ADHD, the benefits and clarity that I got in the first two weeks following the start of Vyvanse have not returned nor do I expect them to. I still have my bad days, but I can honestly say that I am happy for the first time in my life. I am happy with me.    This isn't meant to be fact or representative of what everyone will experience. This just one person's story among thousands of others out there. There were numerous struggles and pain and suffering to get the point I'm at, not just in the experience since the thought I could have ADHD to diagnosis to now, but also in the 28 years prior... This post is already too long though...  **TL;DR**  I just wanted to say thank you /r/ADHD for helping me, whether I posted or just read, whether you responded or just read. Thank you for being a part of me getting my life back from the grips of ADHD and the depression that was paired with it. If you told me a year ago that I'd be where I am now, I'd never have believed you.

I'm a skeptic looking for other people's thoughts who have done something similar.;;;The [program](http://www.braintutoringutah.com) in question.   I went with my parents and met with a guy that worked for this company and did some of the same type of tests I did when I was first diagnosed with ADHD. The company is pretty serious that their program can help improve focus and short term memory as well as a list of other things that made it sound like I should've heard about this before.     It's an alternative medicine and the guy I talked to has been pretty insistent on trying to get me to start as soon as possible. I'm already skeptical about a lot of things so I just wanted to see if anyone else had any experience or was able to pull of some better research than I can find on my own.

You will be held gently accountable (which is a good thing!) and we can check in with you...helping YOU get things done.  *I suggest you read the whole post to be MORE successful, so put in the little extra initial effort and continue reading....*  *** ## Choose the participation method that works for you: * **Most important task** - Share one (or a couple) **HIGH-PRIORITY** tasks that you really would like to finally finish.  *(Ex. Set a doctors appointment, finish assignment, clean the kitchen...whatever YOU think is most important.)* * **Make a list** - Post a list of all the things you want to accomplish this week.  *(I highly recommend identifying the top 3 priorities.)* * **Feed your soul** - Sometimes by relaxing and having fun we have more energy to get more done. **List a couple FUN items to make your list more exciting.**  **Need/Want to copy last week's list *verbatim*?  Absolutely DO SO!**  *Those might be your keystone habits. Once you start doing those regularly you are able to do more. soon they will be automatic and you can put your focus elsewhere.*  *** By sharing our goal(s) with this understanding community, we can keep each other **accountable**...and **celebrate our successes**, large or small!  **Don’t forget to return for [Win Wedenesday] to flaunt your successes!**  ;-)  By getting one small task done it creates **momentum**, **trust** in yourself, **confidence**, and you will feel like doing more.  *** ## Suggested Guidelines * **Prioritize your list.** One thing you want to get done (or start). What is the most important thing for you? (If making a list works best for you feel free to do that too!) * **Add a finish OR start deadline.** By committing to a date/time, we can check on your progress. * **Edit your comment when done.** - Come back and edit your comment when you have finished your goal. We can celebrate that (and then people won't check on you). * **Small start.** - Share what SMALL (under 10 minutes) commitment you can make towards your goal.  *I found when my clients didn’t reach their goals 90% of the time they never started...this will help you break through the initial barrier.*  *** ## Tips * Your tasks/goals should ideally be S.M.A.R.T goals: **Specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound** * **Measurable** - Make sure you can be able to say YES I DID THIS. **Study enough** is not measurable.  Study 2 hours is. * **Break it down** - Instead of saying clean my room...it might help to say, “Clean room for 10 minutes or pick up trash in room.” * **Write it down elsewhere** - Sticky note by computer.  Google calendar.  Agenda.  Write it down so you don't forget.  Our working memories are flaky.... * **Start small...build up slowly** - We want to build on small successes so committing to cleaning your entire house might be a bit too much to handle.  Pick a room (or a task like ‘pick up dirty laundry’)  instead. * **Want to study for 2 hours a day?** *Commit to studying 30 minutes to make it easier on you.*  *** ## Examples from previous weeks: * Tidy room. * Buy car. * Go to work. * Attend all my classes on time. * Reschedule appointment. * Mornings: brush teeth &amp; meditate.  Evenings: brush teeth, meditate, journal. * Pay bills. * Plan vacation. * Go to the gym 3x this week. * Break down chores by days so I can have 'a day off with my darling' before he leaves. * **Start** *[something]*. “Spend 5 minutes on writing my paper.”  *** ## *It’s now easier to respond!

It's like the third time that I start writing this post because I'm drunk and I click other Safari tabs. My english is a crap, sorry.  OK. My therapist diagnosed me with ADHD a month ago. My life is a pure mess (lionel mess) right now. I was fired like 3 months ago from a cool company in the biggest city of my country and now I returned to my small hometown with my parents. I'm talented for what I professionally used to do but I need that + of effort and FOCUS. I can't.  I feel deeply unmotivated with almost everything. I'd spent like a week alone in my parents' house (they are on holidays) on the internet, jerking off with Tinder fatties and watching tennis. I don't feel the impulse of being with my friends/people. I love them with all my heart but I feel pretty bored. And now while I'm writhing this I'm feeling like guilty, but is my reality.  I only feel stimulated if there are women around. I think that this shit happens to me since always; I suppose that I'm seeking approval because of my insecurities or child/family experiences.   I'm attractive but I have being reading a lot about pickup on the internet and that shit destroyed my natural and authentic game with women. I used to be magnetic, lol.  So what?   I can't push me to go out with friends because my energy simply drops. If I don't hang out I am not going to improve my sociability. If I don't improve my sociability I'm not going to get the pussy or I am not going to be so successful in my career. BUT I CAN'T, I FEEL BORED AND WITHOUT ENERGY.  Does this sound familiar to any of you guys? Do you think that maybe it has something to do with ADHD? with fapping? with introversion? any advice? life is a game.  Hugs and thank you for reading
9f26dacf5673c428a50effe38d869c363a4c34395f634df52b905bf62d516569;;;Is a diagnosis worth it?;;;I'm a grown ass man - early thirties. I have had ADHD all my life, my sister and mother both have it as well. My mom wouldn't have us diagnosed as kids because she is a hardcore Christian and wouldn't have let us take medication anyways. I am married but my wife is from another country and when I explain my behaviors by pointing to ADHD she finds it hard to believe. I know she kind of understands what the disorder is but it is not diagnosed in her culture, so I get the feeling she think is I am simply making excuses. That upsets me, but I also can see where she is coming from. ADHD almost doesn't exist in her culture. At this age, the small struggles in working an office job are becoming more and more difficult to manage as I progress and I am wondering if there is value to be had in seeking a professional diagnosis at this point. I also have my reservations about being stigmatized in any way if I do seek diagnosis - just being honest. I have dealt well up until now, but I'm interested in opinions on seeking a diagnosis at this point in my life. Would appreciate any input. Cheers! -Jerry
8a9ea6cf635a641d045c2b8f97a5813dbdd634b7c1e86906b6e3c75fd2b736c9;;;I just need to vent. First day on meds and feeling worried about the future.;;;Hey everyone,   This subreddit has been an amazing place for support. Right now,  I think I'm just in need of getting my thoughts out. I was diagnosed with ADHD yesterday, and have started 150mg (2x/day) of Bupropion as of today. I'm 26/F, and have the typical female diagnosed late in life story (not to down play it, but you're all familiar with it).  I'm feeling a little dizzy, but otherwise good today, managed to study for 4 straight hours which was nice. Though, the fact that I even TOOK the medication today meant that today was going to be a "good day" anyway - I have days where I get hyper focused/fearless and "on top of things" if I'm particularly engaged - so it may not have anything to do with the meds.   I've been seeing a counsellor for about 4 months now, and have been accepting that I probably have ADHD. This has done wonders for my morale. I was scoring very high on "Global Distress Scale" when I first started attending, but now find myself hard pressed to report any distress. Looking at my thoughts and behaviours through an ADHD-lens has made everything make much more sense, and has removed the guilt and self-loathing I would constantly put myself through over failures. Its given me the ability to get to the root of the issue, and in a lot of cases I'm able to cope/overcome the obstacles now.   So emotionally, this experience has been AMAZING, and I've been able to get that far without meds.   Now, I still have a lot of problems with forgetting and motivation and "starting" anything to the point where it causes me to mess up things at work (probably losing 1k a month forgetting to log overtime even), forget important (potentially very medically important) doctors appointments, can't keep track of any meetings/appointments,  personal hygiene can be lacking out of losing track of time in the morning etc... So my ADHD poses some major health/life issues.   The way I see it, not taking these meds could actually cause serious harm to me - as in - I continue to not pay attention to medically important things/may zone out while driving and actually be much worse off than anything the medication could have done in terms of side effects.   But I would like to not have to take them. There is no shame in taking meds, so that's not where this sentiment is coming from. I've just been doing so well with the emotional side of things, I wonder how well I can tackle the behavioural side. I'm thinking I may want to use the meds as an aid in getting myself on track. But maybe that's not physically possible and I will need them to STAY on track... I guess the only way to find out is to try, or maybe try staying off them for now, and going gung-ho on getting my behaviors under control. If I can't get it under control then the meds will be Plan B. Then again, I may just do the usual gung-ho for 1-5 days, then completely stop and then beat myself up every time I think I should be gung-hoing, but being incapable of getting started... Sometimes I am literally yelling at myself in my head to do something, or to stop something and I just don't react...   Does anyone have similar thoughts? Have you had success in managing ADHD without meds, or perhaps used them as an aid to behavioural changing techniques? As I'm asking this I clicked the Wiki by accident in one of my 1000 open tabs, looks like most of the answers I need are there haha! Love this place!  I may just need to get over it and accept that I need meds in order to function normally. The thought is a little scary though, and worrisome when it means I have to be super careful about other medications and alcohol and ... herbs...   I'm feeling pretty focused and "on" today, but I think it may be too soon to be feeling the effects of the meds. Meaning, I'm experiencing a placebo effect. Which means I should be capable of this on my own to some extent. Although I have been reading that Wellbutrin can act immediately in ADHD, but not depression.   Anyway, thank you for reading. On another note,  THANKS EVERYONE! I started reading this subreddit when I saw a post and identified with the sentiments expressed. I did some more research and realized the reason depression as a diagnosis (which I always thought I had low levels of) never felt "right" was because my problems were brought on by inattention/motivation issues. Reading here pushed me to see a counsellor, and then gave me the nerve to see a psychiatrist. So thanks very much =)   **TL:DR;** Thanks for being a great subreddit, and I'm going to read the Wiki for some more behavioral techniques on coping in addition to taking/maybe not taking my prescribed meds

What can I do to be less impulsive?;;;I'm not good at a lot of things, but I am really, *really* good at making friends. I've moved a lot. But I'm only good at the making part. Anybody close to me comes to be sick of me pretty soon after. It's either because I get too comfortable around them and start acting obnoxious, or I get really angry at them and decide to shut them out of my life forever, only to make up with them the next day. Severe mood swings etc.  I've always been incredibly impulsive throughout life and recently got diagnosed with ADHD. Will medication improve my impulsiveness? What do you do to help remember to chill the fuck out? I thought maybe I was a helpless asshole but I'm starting to feel like I might be salvageable.

2afb0d2845a07e921fe68820a48f75392111335f400274eac4885ae699af4ba3;;;Tired of emotions;;;Hi. Just diagnosed in mid July with ADHD. Quit work, took a leave from my masters and moved back into parents house. Finances and inability to cope with symptoms pushed me to do this. I am positive that I also have severe depression and anxiety. I took adderall xr 20 mg yesterday, plowed through work but still swet like a motherfucker (i have hyperhidrosis). Now lying in bed after not sleeping almost the entire night and my adhd is playing its typical games on me.  The hardest part i find is to not think about a certain past relationship that failed. I keep thinking about it and wondering how things would have ended up had i been diagnosed then. Often i get flashbacks 70% about ex or related and 30% about other things. Most of the time they are emotional flashbacks, meaning i get impaired and feel anxiety/depression even more when they happen. Adderall seems to help but not as much as i had hoped. Obviously this is not healthy. Relationship ended almost 2 years ago. I know and understand how i SHOULD be behaving and reacting and managing but fuck i am just too exhausted to cope with it.  Im tired, mentally exhausted, my coping tank is depleted as ive been getting thoughts and reading reddit adhd board on suicide. I wont do it but it makes me feel better that if i wont find a way out of this internal state of mine, i can always end it. Adderall comedown might influence these thoughts but ive had them even before i tried the first dose of adderall.   Even as i write this the flashbacks energized with anxiety and uneasy feeling keep impairing me.  Can anyone else relate? Advice is greatly appreciated.   Ps. Ill call a helpline or talk to my bro if it gets escalated. Suicide aint the way out.  Edit: Just researched about Guanfacine (Intuniv). Will be going to a doctor to get a script. Apparently this medication can alleviate symptoms of anxiety and enable better emotional regulation. I will try it asap and report back here. Hopefully it will help with hyperhidrosis.   Edit 2: Spent 10 hours going between docs and hospital and finally manager to get an ER doc to write a script for Intuniv. Im taking my first 1mg dose tonight and will report by the end of tomorrow on how things go from here.  Edit 3: SUCCESSS!!!!! Last night I had amazing sleep. Wole up in a great mood but a bit tired. As soon as i took adderall everything leveled out. My emotions are under control. No more severe flashbacks. My blood pressure has normalized to 120-75 and best of all I have minimal anxiety. Unfortunately sweating has not stopped. I will report back in a few days.
3d2ee8160597b75c170724de342dedc3e46bb22adb47a689f426058e2e2f24ea;;;New job with insurance, can finally get meds again!;;;I'm about to have health insurance for the first time in several years because of a new job, no, a new *career*. I really want to emphasize career, because I'm hoping this turns into a career. I ended up with a great company who cares more about its employees than any place I've ever worked. I didn't even think places like this actually existed. My previous jobs have almost all been retail, and the few office jobs I have had were really low-level things with no opportunities for advancement.  Being unmedicated for the last few years hasn't been so bad, mostly because I wasn’t being challenged to the point where my ADHD got in the way of my working life. My last permanent job involved me sitting at a desk in an empty office and doing maybe 2 hours of work every day (this company later went out of business). Before that, I worked as a cashier/barista, which is a great ADHD job, except when it isn't busy (because that's when you have to force yourself to find something to do).   But those days are over. I have to learn how to do a new job in a field I'm unfamiliar with, and I'm beginning to struggle again. Of course, the people training me say things like, "I'd rather you ask me how to do something 20 times than tell me nothing and end up making mistakes," but of course nobody really likes being asked how to do the same thing 20 times. Last week I needed help doing something but the coworker who could help me was in the middle of something really important, and she looked visibly frustrated when I came over to ask her for help. She apologized for being unable to help at the time (she--like all my coworkers--is actually really nice), but I felt so lost. I tried to tell myself it was nothing personal, but I won't lie, I felt a little rejected. Mostly, I was just paralyzed with anxiety, thinking “What am I supposed to do now?”  I think what I’m *supposed to do now* is get back on medication. It’s not just because I’m afraid I won’t do well at work. It’s also because I really want to be someone my coworkers feel they can depend on. If this job works out, I might even go back to school and finish my bachelor’s degree so I can move higher up. This job represents an opportunity I’ve never had before: unlike my time in retail where shift leads would always treat their employees like children who need to be micromanaged, I’m given an incredible amount of autonomy and discretion to get my work done however works best for me. They actually *treat me like an adult*, and I want to live up to—and exceed—their expectations. To do that, I really need to have a fully functioning brain.  And of course, it’s not just because I want to be a great employee. I also miss being able to read through books without getting distracted every 15 seconds. I’m about half way through four books right now (not including the various computer programming books I’m in various stages of). I also love to write, and I often have trouble keeping my writing focused. I’m sure this very post could have been better organized and written.  My insurance kicks in on the first of next month. A friend has given me the name and number of a nurse practitioner who is an ADHD specialist practicing in my town. I don’t think there will be any issues “proving” my ADHD (I have a medical history to back up the diagnosis).   **TL;DR: I'm going back on meds after a long absence, and I'm excited and wanted to tell someone.**
ee27437445bdd431676c23d777e548a30f1295430b010d9c647e6c2a1d2403be;;;Very good post in /r/news that both highlights the current problem with the mental health system and how people view ADHD/Depression;;;[https://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3h80aj/morgan_freemans_goddaughter_stabbed_to_death_in/cu5bl79](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3h80aj/morgan_freemans_goddaughter_stabbed_to_death_in/cu5bl79)  (Click the link for a better formatted version, just remember. ***Don't upvote or downvote anything***)  &gt;This is a pretty big topic for a Reddit post, but let's give it a go. Once upon a time, the US had a very serious, well funded, and comprehensive mental health program. We [start with deinstitutionalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinstitutionalisation), circa 1955. As a whole, this was a good thing. It's one thing to say that the mentally ill need help. It's another to treat a wide range of mental difficulties as dehumanizing conditions that deserve lifelong imprisonment in a mental hospital. It wasn't perfect, though. Towards the end of the deinstitutionalization movement, we get [the Community Mental Health Act of 1963](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Mental_Health_Act). This marks the start of what you'd recognize as the modern US mental health policy. State hospitals for mental health will still exist, but unless sufferers pose an imminent threat to themselves or others, there's no state-funded care. State-funded care comes with state-funded compulsion. Basically, unless the police will dump your ass in a psych ward, you need to handle your own care. If you're interested in what that looked like on a personal level, the New York Times put out [an interesting, if long, article](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402E0DE1138F937A15755C0A9649D8B63) on it. In theory, the CMHA was supposed to provide funding for private care, but [that didn't quite pan out](http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/50-years-later-kennedyrsquos-vision-for-mental-health-not-realized/). Not enough money. Not enough community support. Perverse incentives to put people where they don't belong. So then, what happens? They go where all American societal problems go when we stop caring: [prison](http://www.tacreports.org/storage/documents/treatment-behind-bars/treatment-behind-bars-abridged.pdf). If you're a drug addict, you don't go to a hospital (unless you're rich enough for multiple trips to fairly low-success rehab clinics), you go to prison for possession. If you're schizophrenic and can't afford or start refusing your meds, you're on your own until you have an incident and stab Morgan Freeman's goddaughter. Then you go to prison. Increasingly, if you're just unbalanced enough that it's hard to keep a job, you go to prison for sleeping in public or panhandling. What's left isn't a failing system. The system is gone. The state's only involvement in mental health is via police. Suicidal? Handcuffed and shipped off to a psych ward. Knife in hand and ready to go off? Psych ward or prison, pretty much at random. Can't function like everyone else? Prison. Where's the actual treatment in all of this? It *does* exist, but only if you have money. The people who need help are less likely than the population at large to have money, so there's lots of treatment for things like high functioning depressives and kids with ADHD and not so much for the people who need it more. It's not a public health policy anymore.  So, the mental health system stuff is rather obvious, but what I wanted to point out is his last statement.  &gt;so there's lots of treatment for things like high functioning depressives and kids with ADHD and not so much for the people who need it more.  Now, before you start demanding this guy be burned on the stake, let me explain how his innocent here.  You see, this is how the average american views depression and ADHD, they view it as non-problems and something you can just work off. For most of us, this is not the case. But why does he believe this?  Well, its simple. He doesn't know any better. No one ever told him how ADHD and Depression can be just as debilitating as something like schizophrenia. Hell, if anything, american media portrays both conditions as a joke the vast majority of the time. This is the main problem. Change will never happen if the general public remains ignorant of the reality's of these conditions.  So, whats your opinion on this? How could we change this with-in the foresee-able future?

Can you have a low or average IQ and still be smart?;;;I got around to reading my diagnosis paperwork after a year of getting it, and found I fall 92 IQ, which is barely at average intelligence.   My parents and teachers and other people called me smart, intelligent and bright all the time. I begin to wonder how I am smart with a 92 IQ? With this score I'm not much better than anyone else. If I was actually smart, wouldn't I fall under the 115+ range?  Is IQ even a good measurement of intelligence? If not, what can?  Can you have an average iq and still be smart?

Not sure what to do next.;;;After doing a lot of reading through Google and this subbreddit, I've convinced myself I have ADD. I'm 23 years old, excelled in high school but dropped out of college due to it not feeling rewarding. I have a decent job in IT, but I am required to keep myself on task and am on the verge of being fired due to just not being able to accomplish anything in a timely manner. My relationship is in shambles due to my own anger and apathy. The list of potential symptoms goes on. I don't want to blame my actions on a condition, but after reading here it seems like my symptoms line up perfectly with ADD.   But here's my question, I don't have health insurance. My work offers insurance coverage but I have to potentially wait until July of next year to get coverage or be charged for each month that has passed since July. Should I see a physician and get diagnosed and meds without insurance or wait? The potential benefit of medication is exciting to me but I don't want to have a "pre-existing condition" and never be able to get it covered. Thanks for any help or insight.
065c52000dee20fa4c504eb7a0ddb3655aa43d35103a4be2fbfeaf2692fef968;;;An email I sent to my music teacher regarding difficulties I am experiencing;;;Dear [teachers name removed for privacy]  After this coming lesson, I would like to take a short break of two weeks or so. I'm having difficulties finding motivation to practice - or even do anything much. It is sad after already such a long summer break, but I feel I'm wasting time repeating mistakes over and over that are not being ironed out.  This is consistent for my art as well, and I don't know how I will handle going back on the 28th. I have told one of the seniors of the situation but did not receive a response.   I have had problems with motivation and focus since I was a kid, it may well likely be some kind of ADD.  Now that I am coming into my third (maybe technically fourth) year of being at the art school with a very tiny portfolio that consists of photographs of long-binned artwork, it is becoming more and more obvious that I am getting older and the difficulties are not getting worse but becoming more obvious.  In my time at the school, I have watched people come and work full time and progress rapidly. I have seen people prepare entire portfolios within the time I have been there and begin taking commissions, I saw someone arrive and try and then decide he didn't like the system and then went onto prepare an application for a top US art university and then subsequently got accepted and left.   Meanwhile, I'm faffing around with my painting thinking about something irrelevant and not fixing the simple problem that the teacher pointed out an hour and a half ago. Add in the social anxiety problems and difficulties making friends and relating to the other people in my class and I just feel discouraged and at the end of every term I always ask myself "why am I here". But I always go back, I don't know why I am so persistent. I won't have anyone tell me "maybe this isn't for you".  All of this makes me quite sad.  A big problem I have is multi-tasking, which is ironic because of the dozens upon dozens of interests that I have.  It's not just doing two activities at the same time that I find difficult, it's having dual or more events or plans in a day or a week. If I know I have something to do at the end of the day or something big or important planned at the end of the week, it affects the quality of my focus up until the point that that happens. I've done it all, diaries and alarms and schedules, it's all useless.   I have read that ADD may not actually be a disorder, but a natural variation of the mind and the symptoms of which would have been extremely useful in a hunter-gather society - in fact in many primitive tribes, people with ADD/ADHD symptoms observably have an advantage.  The truth is though, none of the things I want to pursue are very compatible with ADD symptoms, and it's just my luck that it happened to go that way. I enjoy learning systems and finding out how things work which is probably why I'm drawn to both of those things. But singing and art both require stints of careful concentration to get better and get results; when I engage in something that requires concentration zoning out whilst mindlessly droning on with the physical aspect of what I am doing is extremely difficult to prevent.  And then there is the problem of getting swept up in something intriguing like an article on testing the ripeness of camembert, which leads to an afternoon of reading about cheese, which will end up with me watching a two hour documentary on cheese making and then it's time for bed and the next day I'll start reading about Japanese kanji and then I'll decide that I'll spend a week learning to read Japanese and then have an existential crisis over what I'll do, then I'll have a successful day in school and I'll decide that no, I want to draw for a living.   I have heard wonderful stories about Concerta, I have heard of people taking Concerta and then having a course of counselling because they become depressed about all their wasted opportunities and what could have been had they received a diagnosis sooner.  I have been waiting and waiting for this referral to the ASD specialist, but I feel that at the end of it I am going to get a diagnosis, but not the diagnosis that would give me access to this drug. I feel I want to go the GP about this as a separate issue, but I feel they may tell me that I am already in the system for something and have to see it out before pursuing another diagnosis.  By little stretch of the imagination, this all makes me a bit depressed but I dare not bring it up to the GP or the psychiatrists because the system favours treating common symptoms over more complex situations and concentration and motivation problems are common symptoms of depression. They would just put me on another course of citalopram.   So there we are really, that's where we are right now. I rang the ASD department and they haven't even issued me an appointment yet, I have no idea if the woman in charge has even gone through my questionnaires, as apparently she's only in the office 4 hours a day.  Thank you for listening

I don't mean like, using some tool to change the text color to yellow around the important parts. I mean like, as I'm reading it, I constantly use my cursor to highlight around where I'm reading and unhighlight it involuntarily, probably at a rate of about 6 times every 5 seconds.  I was diagnosed with ADHD-PI and didn't really experience any symptoms of ADHD-PH before diagnosis, but I also seem to fidget and whatnot now that I'm on stimulant medication. It's not really a problem - it doesn't keep me from focusing or disturb those around me - I just find it interesting. Has anyone else had a similar experience?
1eb30c9af8d96195c5665ff1b42e470b4589efdd31168323decfce506948f4d6;;;ADHD and relationships;;;I've had ADHD for over twenty years now and I came out of the closet to everyone about 3 years ago. Since then I've had a few relationships here and there but Jesus they've been up and down. I haven't dated anyone for more than 2 months, nothing significant at all.   One of the things that I hate about having ADHD are the mood swings I get when I'm dating someone. One day I'm on cloud 9 because I really like a guy, but if the next day he has to postpone a date because of something I feel like our relationship is doomed and he's going to dump me. Then he'll text me later and make plans for a follow up and suddenly I feel great again. There is no middle ground. There is no medium. It's like I'm either flying high with someone, or if there's the slightest setback then I feel like it's completely over.   The guy I'm dating was supposed to come over tonight for dinner and stay over. All day I was cooking and prepping for him, but he called and asked if we could push it to tomorrow because he's swamped with school work and he wouldn't be able to give me the time I deserve tonight. Now, I'm not mad at him at all. I told him I understand and I really do. Things happen. He just asked if we could push it to tomorrow and that's totally fine. But deep down I'm crushed. We just started dating a few weeks ago and I really like him a lot, but knowing that these things are going to come up, and the depression and loneliness that follows is a killer for me. I can't stand it.   I wish I could turn off my hyper-focus sometimes. It's great when I'm reading a book and want to finish it in one sitting, but when things like this happen I get so freakin' depressed and it's so hard to stay busy to keep my mind off of it.   What do you all do to fight this?
0e80a22a6fa292a8e5fe40dbe38749c3f18d168318df5722c96a1a8ce2d6de50;;;Im not sure what to think anymore.;;;So I started to think i have add. I am 17 years old and dont have the best grades. Freshman year i started with a 1.8 gpa and went up to a 2.8 for my senior year. For my whole life i have struggled focusing on conversations, sleeping, and starting and finishing things. I never thought i may have something wrong with me. I thought all of these problems i have were just me. Regarding conversations, I cant focus for long at all if someones telling me a story. I just try and think of what I should respond next, and other things. Its like all of my thought collide and i just forget them. The only way ive been able to study if the material is given to me. My senior year i have a teacher that lectures and we take notes off of what he says. This is a huge problem for me considering I cant focus at all because of all my thoughts. Also we read the story beowulf and i cant remember a single thing it was about. As far as sleeping goes, my thoughts seem to wake me up as i sleep. Sometimes i move my legs back and forth because i feel restless.  I had to take the act yesterday. The english part went well, but when i got to the reading, it really stressed me out. I would read the whole article and barely remember any of it. I zone out while im reading it, but dont remember what i just read. Then the 5 minute mark came and i still had 14 questions to answer. This totally stressed me out to the point where i couldnt think at all and started to fidget very bad. So the act did not go well at all. It really starts to get depressing since i think i am just dumb. I cant even finish a video game anymore. I have to write 2 papers and i just cant start them. I just dont want to go to the doctor and have him say there is nothing wrong with me.  tl;dr: I cant focus on someones conversation for more than 5 seconds. I cant sleep because all of my thinking wakes me up. I cant start projects or even finish video games.

I was doing alright at the old dosage but I noticed the effects diminishing slightly after about 7 months.   She told me if I find I don't like this new dosage to let them know when I call next month to get another script.   So what I want to do is bring my one month prescription to the pharmacy and have them only dispense a weeks worth and keep the rest on hold. That way if after a week I don't like it, I can have it switched back and won't be stuck for a month with meds that don't work well.  My thinking is that the DEA only allows them to prescribe for a month based on days. If I am only given a week's amount, then afterwards I can get more.  Is this possible?
2423501c360c11d8145ae66de4089e11ec379b0417c41f26fe477d1492ce8dd6;;;How can I overcome the fear of failure so that it stops my paralysis by analysis and allows me to follow my innate desire to take risks?;;;I recently read *The ADHD Advantage* by Dale Archer, MD after learning that the non-stop motor running in my brain was attributable to ADHD.   I am a slow reader who hates books/reading and generally do not have the attention span to finish them... but I finished this one in 3 hours and retained it all (thanks, ADHD Hyperfocus Mode). One of the biggest things I related to was how people with this condition often loathe the consistency (read: monotony) of the "daily grind" and aspire for "more in life." This sums me up to a T.   I want to do something new and exciting, be my own boss, and impact the world in a positive way. What ends up happening is I get these great moments of inspiration, brainstorm for hours, and then ultimately get overwhelmed with all of the brainstorming I have done and just go do something else to get my mind off of the stress I just manufactured for myself. This leaves me in no better position than I was before, and then I am left to think about all of the things I haven't accomplished, which is very toxic to my well being.   Dale Archer's book talked about how ADHDers often take risk and 'go for it,' but I am so self-critical and self-conscious that I find a way to talk myself out of all the creative ideas I come up with out of the fear of failure, even if I think they are really good ideas.   **TL;DR My fear of failure causes me to be a little *too* diligent of a researcher, which leads to paralysis by analysis, which leads to me being stressed that I have not yet started a business, which leads to researching business ideas... etc.**  EDIT: Thanks so much for all the replies &amp; commentary. I thought I might share this advice I found from a Myers-Briggs type analysis in case this is more of a personality type issue than an ADHD issue (maybe the two go hand in hand, I don't know?)  * Personal Growth Recommendations for Type Fours Fours grow by recognizing that while the hurts and losses of the past were real enough, there is no need to keep revisiting them in the imagination. On the contrary, doing so keeps drawing them out of the richness and depth of the present moment—the one time and place in which their real feelings and their true identity can be found. Fours need to see how working up their feelings actually moves them further away from their most authentic self and their truest self expression.  * Do not pay so much attention to your feelings; they are not a true source of support for you, as you probably already know. Remember this advice: “From our present perspective, we can also see that one of the most important mistakes Fours make is to equate themselves with their feelings. The fallacy is that to understand themselves they must understand their feelings, particularly their negative ones, before acting. Fours do not see that the self is not the same as its feelings or that the presence of negative feelings does not preclude the presence of good in themselves” (Personality Types, p. 172). Always remember that your feelings are telling you something about yourself as you are at this particular moment, not necessarily more than that.  * Avoid putting off things until you are “in the right mood.” Commit yourself to productive, meaningful work that will contribute to your good and that of others, no matter how small the contribution may be. Working consistently in the real world will create a context in which you can discover yourself and your talents. (Actually, you are happiest when you are working—that is, activating your potentials and realizing yourself. You will not “find yourself” in a vacuum or while waiting for inspiration to strike, so connect—and stay connected—with the real world.  * Self-esteem and self-confidence will develop only from having positive experiences, whether or not you believe that you are ready to have them. Therefore, put yourself in the way of good. You may never feel that you are ready to take on a challenge of some sort, that you always need more time. (Fours typically never feel that they are sufficiently “together,” but they must nevertheless have the courage to stop putting off their lives.) Even if you start small, commit yourself to doing something that will bring out the best in you.  * A wholesome self-discipline takes many forms, from sleeping regular hours to working regularly to exercising regularly, and has a cumulative, strengthening effect. Since it comes from yourself, a healthy self-discipline is not contrary to your freedom or individuality. On the other hand, sensuality, excessive sexual experiences, alcohol, drugs, sleep, or fantasizing have a debilitating effect on you, as you already know. Therefore, practice healthy self-discipline and stay with it. Avoid lengthy conversations in your imagination, particularly if they are negative, resentful, or even excessively romantic. These conversations are essentially unreal and at best only rehearsals for action—although, as you know, you almost never say or do what you imagine you will. Instead of spending time imagining your life and relationships, begin to live them.

I'm currently working at a Tech Startup, and the days are getting pretty long - this involves waking up at 9am and working from 10am to 6pm.  While I get that this isn't a super long day when compared to other careers, with my condition and the mental strain the work requires I am finding myself crashing at around 3pm each day.  Is it a bad idea to double up on my 20mg SR Ritalin, and take the second one at 3pm? In theory that would take me through to 10pm which would allow me to get a good amount of work in. Perhaps with a break from work for a good hour at around 1 or 2 pm? I aim to be asleep at 1am, but normally nod off at about 2am - 3am.  I've taken twice in a day several times and noticed no negative side effects, however I don't want to start doing it regularly if there are some really bad potential problems that I've overlooked.  Cheers!
a91bc19196d44c1282bc8f8e0a6fb40df0fb17ddcce8c43788e8bb7cf9086e97;;;Tonight, at 37 years old, I finally get it that I'm not allowed to be ADHD when I'm at my parents house.;;;And I made my parents (who've never believed in ADHD and believe in spirit healing and NOT in vaccines) understand that things like spending an afternoon cleaning up after the mess my six year old and I made in their kitchen and yet forgetting to pick my shoes up from the bathroom floor and not remembering to put the shop vac away are not some kind of irritating, thoughtless negligence they can somehow correct but are part of WHO I AM.  Given that they believe that if I tried harder (and connected to my spirit source or whatever it is this week) that I'd be able to "overcome these kinds of challenges" they've made it clear that as long as I'm "refusing to grow in this way" and "arrogantly not dealing with these easy things I could just deal with if I try harder", that I'm not welcome in their house.  They insist that doesn't mean *I'm* not welcome here and they just can't see how saying "You're welcome here but your ADHD (that we don't really believe in) isn't" isn't the same as saying "You're just not welcome here."  It really is about little things too (isn't it always?).  "You didn't clean the lint trap after you used the dryer."  "You didn't put my drill back in the charging socket."  "You didn't park in the space I asked you to park in."  I kind of blew my lid at my dad over the last one and said some unkind things I really wish I hadn't.  He was kind of taken aback about how strong a reaction he got just from telling me off about where I parked my car.  After a long and tearful discussion, I'm leaving this last visit to the house I grew up in to, for the foreseeable future, never have a lengthy visit or stay for more than a few hours again and not spend my visitation time with my son here anymore.   I'm feeling totally heart broken, especially because my son (and his grandparents) are reaping this price.  But my parent's don't consider this "asking me to change" they consider it "a simple demand that when I'm here I pay attention to small details and don't cause chaos in their orderly lives"  (not causing chaos in his order were almost my dad's exact words).  They're considering my insistance that this is REALLY hard and I can't live up to what they're asking to be "arrogant and disrespectful."  My mom left the room in a huff when I tried to explain that I have a handycap.  My dad practically plugged his ears when I started talking about meds (and why they don't really work for me).  They've known me my whole life!! How do they not get it!?!  I'm not actually asking for help.  I'm just sort of venting frustration and heartbreak on the internet.  I'm not sure there is any help to be had.   Anyway, thank you /r/adhd.  You've been a wonderful help in my life these past few years.  &lt;3  **tl;dr:** Parents don't believe in ADHD, even after knowing me my entire life, basically told me I'm not allowed to be ADHD in their house, don't think they're being unreasonable.

My psychiatrist said the reason she prescribed me Brintellix was because it could help the symptoms of ADHD while treating my mild depression (which, for the record, I sort of disagree about having).  I started on half a pill for the first week, and within the first hour I would get terrible nausea - I had to struggle not to vomit, which was definitely a problem especially on days I had to go to work. It got easier eventually, but once I started taking whole pills it came back. Now it's not as bad as it first was, but if I haven't slept too well it can get quite bad. I've also started getting nearly daily headaches that go away in an hour or so, but they can get quite bad. I get migraines now and then and Brintellix has made them slightly more common. For the past few weeks I've also had trouble sleeping (waking up too early), but I'm not quite certain about the meds having an effect on that.  The biggest issue I'm having with the medication is that I have noticed absolutely zero effect. My concentration is just as bad and I feel like after starting medication I'm even more forgetful than before. The only effects I've been able to attribute to the meds are the nausea and the headaches.  My psychiatrist said that if the meds don't work out too well, we could either up the dosage from 10mg to 20mg and/or start taking methylphenidate - although after these few weeks on Brintellix I can't say I would feel too hopeful about upping my dosage, I'd rather change to another medication.  I'm having my next appointment in a few weeks, and I'm wondering if I should just stop taking Brintellix or keep going until then. I've been taking Brintellix for 4-5 weeks now (the meds should have at least some effect within the second week). Any suggestions on what I should do?  **tl;dr** Been taking Brintellix for 4-5 weeks for ADHD, still no effect

87374b90a2d5c0a73686034e08df02aa586737c1ae02544bc5b89e3529903ee0;;;Diagnosed as an adult, mid 20s. Been on Ritalin for 6 months but work seems to be the only thing giving me anxiety. Should I throw my career out the window?;;;TL:DR version:  Ritalin and medication has helped with anxiety, socialising, my mood. But whenever I work (engineer, lots of calculations) it takes me to my old anxious state.   From your personal experience, would you just try and find a less stressful, more sociable / distracting job ? Or would you push through and eventually work will become manageable as well?    Some background  I'm probably quite intelligent, which meant that together with a tendency for anxiety and a perfectionist attitude, I was able to ace high school, do pretty-good at uni (although constantly needing direction from classmates) and even worked for a few years as a graduate in a really demanding professional field.   As my anxiety progressed however (which I though was totally a normal mindset to be in), I was lucky to realise I was approaching depression. From that point, took me a year and a bit to realise I needed outside help, and another 6 months to  get diagnosed properly (went on Pristiq as the doctor though my functioning was too high for ADHD. It fucked me hard).   Now I find myself in a pretty good state - following a year on a low dose of prozac, did CBT (heavily recommended, get a good health insurance and do it. It's life changing) and got off mirtazepene, I saw my anxiety almost disappear. Mood was back up, became enthusiastic and social like never before.   Well, almost.  Whenever I go to work (engineer), I feel it spike back up. I'm currently in a pretty good position, and although everyone thinks I'm really good, I feel like I'm essentially the jack of all trades / master of none.   Now I'm at the point where to progress I would have to be independent, efficient and dedicated. But every time I sit down, and I know all the basics, I can't for the life of me put it together without becoming a nervous mess. It gets worse through the week, and by the end of the weekend I'm in a good state again only to regress on the monday. I may have been able to produce (barely), but I'm a wreck.  I was wondering what someone with similar experience would do. Find a less stressful, more sociable / distracting job? Or would you push through, maybe give it another year or two hoping that with the Ritalin and new CBT skills, work will become manageable as well?  Any relevant experiences are also heavily appreciated!  Thanks guys  PS. forgot my password, so new account :)

I can barely speak with a GF sitting next to me. It sucks.   Here's what I do. Every so often I hear about accidents and I watch a video. It helps me to prepare for when I get behind the wheel. I hate being this way but I want to improve. I read stats and I ask myself questions like below. Since I can't drive with you to an accident watch the attached video.  This stat scared me!   &gt;[Overall, having ADHD increased a man's risk of a traffic crash by 47 percent and a woman's risk by 45 percent, the researchers found.](http://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/news/20140129/drivers-with-adhd-may-be-at-higher-risk-for-serious-crashes)   I have been in too many car accidents. While I have never been found responsible (only one no fault) I have been a passenger or driving when hit close to 10 times. The last time a young woman turned right I to me when I was going 40 mph. Totalled my car and cost me a fortune even though she was found at fault and had insurance. She was texting. And she was so out of it she told me she had done the same thing two months earlier. You should have seen the look on her poor father when he pulled up to two more totalled cars.   I have my issues with adrenaline. Ever since I can remember I have pushed things too far. My friends and I have done some risky things and usually got off unscathed. That said there have been too many occasions when i have honestly wished i could turn back the clock for something i have said or done out of impulse.  I'm not saying I don't have fun. I just dont make driving my source of fun. Out of all the crazy things ive done in pursuit of adrenaline free diving at night in the Pacific ocean is probably the top. You can only see that beam of light in front of you! I've only gone a handful of times.  I have to make driving an exception in my life. I have to slow down and do my best to solely focus on driving. Call it mindfulness or paranoia! There have just been countless times I've wished I could have had an undo button for real life. Nope. Hasn't happened for me yet.   Try this excercise.   [Removed video.]  While watching the first video (not gory, just a car crash) I couldnt help but ask myself the following questions:  * Did she mean to hit a parked CalTrans truck on the side of the freeway? * Did she regret speeding in a rented van with two passengers? * Did she say she was pregnant when on the gurney? * Did she get the optional insurance when she rented the van? * Did she realize that her personal car insurance most likely won't cover this? * Did she realize the rental company will want her to pay for all costs until paid? * Did she realize there were four people in the CalTrans truck? * Did she knows the extent of the injuries she caused the CalTrans worker on the gurney? * Did she have any idea how serious the concussion is for that worker? * Did she think when she decided to drive that she would change the lives of so many people?  I am sure she has many more questions racing through her head. She too must wish that she could go back in time. But she can't. Neither can I. None of us can.  Everyone is different. My friends would probably laugh at this. But if you've ever wished you hadn't  had said or done something after it was too late, you know why I posted this. I wanted to write this down in the hopes I might be a little more careful and live to dodge another accident.  No excuse or diagnosis is worth the cost of wishing I would've done things differently.  What do you guys do to avoid accidents? I live in socal and I swear it's like that classic video game *Frogger* except I'm driving with traffic!

Anyways, my medications are making me feel like a zombie.  I've brought this up with my doctor and he said he would monitor it and we could discuss a change next time.  my meds are intuniv, certriline, and wellbutrin.  idk if it is that mix that is making me feel this way?  anyways, I'm wondering if anyone here has done this before and if they could weigh in on it.
74d7b5537b89f862e2e004c385fe97045fd4e4ec363d2e2fd96240ea1776b5a7;;;So I am reading a lot of ADHD related questions and want to make a pointer for all the problems listed.;;;Honestly, almost every single issue I see here is not just a request for ADHD life hacks, a lot of them seem to sound like full blown anxiety.  Since we have ADHD we automatically assume the worst possible outcome and worry that ADHD = fucking up. People without ADHD fuck up as well. XD  Constantly worrying about the possibility doesn't make us prepared for when something unpredictable does take place.  It is good to take precautions but worrying about every tidbit of outcomes seems unhealthy to me as someone who did go through an anxiety disorder and experienced that very same thing.  People with ADHD are 60-80% more likely to develop co-morbidity. Anxiety disorders being 40%.  Stimulants have a side effect of worsening anxiety or causing it.  The only reason I have my anxiety under control is because of a changed perspective about controlling my environment and meditation.  TL;DR: a lot of the worries on here seem to be caused because of anxiety, even people without ADHD cannot control every single outcome, I would pursue finding a solution to anxiety, even if you find a solution to your current problem, you will surely find another issue that seems insignificant to worry about in no time.

He recommended we try Escitalopram first. 10MG a day for a month, and see if it helps. Anyone else have experience with this solution?  I am really disappointed. I really wanted to get onto an ADHD drug specifically. But I can't tell if my disappointment is just because I don't know enough, and I got my hopes up for just one of the many ways to address this.   I am also disappointed because I've been told this takes a week or two to kick in. And I really wanted to feel a difference today.  Anyway, I am going to go through with the prescribed month of this. And meet with my doctor again to see where I am at that point, and what course to take next.

He prescribed a stimulant to me, and I've been doing stellar ever since.    The prescription the doctor put me on is Vyvanse, which is a schedule II drug, which means I have to have regular appointments to receive new prescriptions.  I recently moved to a new city 3.5 hours from my old town.  I know I'll need to find a new doctor here, but will I also have to be re-diagnosed, or can the old doctor send the information over?  Anyone have experience with a situation like this?

My [22/F] boyfriend [23/M] has ADD and was diagnosed when he was little. When he was 19, he had to have a mechanical heart valve put in and is on blood thinners for the rest of his life to prevent blood clots/strokes. Therefore, he cannot use ADD medication because it affects how his body metabolizes the blood thinners. I have met a lot of people in my life with ADD and have read a lot about it since I started dating my boyfriend. He does exceptionally well for someone who is not medicated and I understand why he does a lot of the things that he does.   I help him remember a lot of things. Everything from important events and doctor appointments to trying to help him find his shoes and keys. I was thinking that we need to work on developing some kind of system. Right now he just tells me things that he does not want to forget and then relies on me to remember them. I don't have a problem with this, but I was wondering if anyone else out there is in my position or has ADD and has a system that works really well for them. Any and all advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks Reddit!
d731dd32c409f6caa164fc5aa90264a0edb29de908d8a66898c31365ed7e3c1b;;;Manipulative relationship or medication issue;;;I've been in a relationship with a girl I met online that has a history of substance abuse and eating disorders. I am diagnosed ADHD and took my Adderall IR 20 mg medication for school and ended up taking too many at one point and battling anxiety and depression. I need to prepare for the bar exam and she tells me that the medication changes the way I look and my personality. I have been on and off Lexapro 10 mg to go along with the Adderall but I don't think it is necessary as she may be the cause of my anxiety. Does taking Adderall everyday really change ones appearence and personality? It works the best for me as far as enabling me to focus and achieve things, but I don't know if I'm bipolar or just in a bad relationship. Anyone have similar experience? Thank you!

37130eea73c65cd9f569893f7579567a20490a726258d761d6ba223ad99ad5cc;;;How am I supposed to be successful at anything?;;;I'm sorry if this is a little venty but I have nowhere else to turn to and I'm struggling hard. I was home schooled the last 2 years of high school because I would never show up to class since I would never do my work and be too embarrassed to admit it to my teachers. About last year, I was diagnosed with ADHD which took me by a huge surprise considering how lethargic I am due to my preexisting Crohn's disease. But in retrospect, it makes sense. My doctor is not supportive of my treatment at all. She believes I'm faking it to abuse medication and so all the medicines I've tried have been things like concerta, ritalin and focalin. Since receiving treatment, my motivation to do school work has skyrocketed. I've become fascinated in chemistry and pharmacology, I have dreams of attending Berkeley and I desperately want to do well in school. I know I can do it. I know I have the intelligence. I'm just f**k awful at applying myself.  About 3 weeks ago I started college at a local community college, which I thought I could handle just fine. But the last 3 weeks have been nothing but hanging out with friends (I've also only recently started developing a social life since I would never show up to school before and didn't have any friends), homework, long, tiring classes and a painful lack of sleep. College has got me feeling like I need to take my medication more and more regularly just to succeed and this kills my appetite, gives me awful insomnia and makes me depressed as hell. Without sleep or a regular diet (I'm at about a meal a day at night now), I can't focus and can't do work. Still, I've attended all of my classes and I'm trying my very hardest. But even with all this effort; it's not enough. I try to keep on top of everything but I've been showing up to classes realizing I hadn't done homework or just forgot about it entirely until the day that it's due. It's week 3 and I'm already screwing up this bad. It feels like my future is slipping out from underneath me and no matter how hard I try it just keeps slipping. Just now, I was at school attempting to complete some work before my next class, when while looking at my Chemistry syllabus, I realized I had been consistently forgetting about due online work. I crashed from my meds, ran home and have been crying for the past hour. Before being diagnosed, I hadn't cried in at least 4 years. What do I do? Is there any way I can get my college to understand this and help me through it? I know I should file for disability or whatever, but I'm a freshman so that's taking quite awhile.  TL;DR: I'm trying my hardest in college and I'm still failing. How do I get through this?

4dd46635f7eb7ba9e7e0798873b222821e9ba92511c83692f9018f63a998e32a;;;My ADHD struggle;;;This is my story of my how my entire life collapsed and fell apart, how ADHD destroyed my life  About 10 years ago I was diagnosed with ADHD. I was a 1st grader having no idea what was going on and constantly being unable to control my body. I was always getting in trouble for being loud and impulsive during class. As soon as I started on a certain medication called daytrana(methilphindiate in patch form) my life started getting better, I had gotten some control over it. I was able to make friends and keep them while keeping this thing I still did not understand at the time under control. But as the years went by I slowly lost control over it again. 5 years ago when I went into 6th grade I totally lost control over it, it was the new environment I suppose. I was annoying and impulsive. I annoyed lots of people and that's when I started loosing friends. Kids in my grade started disliking me, I began to get bullied. When 7th grade came I got some control over it again. I was still annoying but not as much. 7th and 8th grade were good years. Still though slowly as the years went by more kids started disliking me. When 9th grade hit and the environment change my life really started falling apart.  The year started out with me loosing complete control of my ADHD. I became extremely annoying and impulsive. Some kids described me as creepy. I was told that I scared people Kids started being mean to me. Tons of kids just started disliking me and hating me. I was kicked out of clubs. My teachers were no support at all. When an email was sent out to them saying what was going on and how I needed support. I had a teacher start calling me immature being mean to me. Giving me bad grades and an unfair choice. I had another teacher start telling me that I'm harassing his students. I have no idea where he got that from. I was the one being harassed in his class. A kid twisted my arm and then broke my binder and he starts telling me I'm harassing his students. Other teachers weren't very nice either. I only had on teacher. She was probably one of the best teachers I ever had. She gave me a NASA calendar. I fell in love with the band imagine dragons in 8th grade. Their song "top of the world" made me develop a deep passion and love for space and math. The teacher giving me that calendar really made me happy and feel better. But things weren't getting my better. It was halfway through the year at this point and I was being told on a weekly basis "to kill myself". Kids told me I was creepy. I had lost so many friends and kids all around were starting to dislike me. By the end of the year I had only 10 or 11 friends. My grades were amazing despite everything that was going on. But depression was starting to take me over. The thoughts that all these kids think I'm annoying and creepy and I can't help it. I tried desperately to stop. I kept failing, it's just how our brains work I guess.   I went to an imagine dragons concert in June. It was the best night of my life. The songs they make relate so much to my life. Seeing "top of the world" live really made me happy. Over the summer I began to get severe depression. I felt hopeless and worthless. I was having suicidal thoughts. I was sad all the time. I had lost interest in the things I loved like gaming and doing other things. I would spend my days in August lying in bed just listening to imagine dragons. The entire smokes and mirrors album really helped me. Songs like "shots", "hopeless opus", "Polaroid", "trouble", "smokes and mirrors" and "the fall" really relate to my life in so many ways. That band helped me get through the summer. The town I live in had an annually festival like usual just before school starts. I went to it with my only friends left and I saw all these kids, kids I used to be friends with. Now they were just giving me looks. Mean looks. I was still annoying and I couldn't control it. Then something happened their that I don't really want to explain but it gave me hope. The final day of the festival I missed. I had been admitted into a mental hospital at 4 am that morning. During my stay I began to feel better and think things would get better. That thing that happened at the festival really gave me hope. After spending 5 days in the hospital I was released. I went to school the next day and things just feel apart. I saw the kids that had indirectly put me in that hospital. Put me in this mess. The kids that told me to kill myself and the kids that had been mean to me the previous year. After school I cried. I don't understand why all this happened to me. How this disorder, this mental illness, completely ruined my life. Over the weekend things got worse. I did some really annoying stuff. After a week of being out of the hospital I had lost 7 of my closest friends. People who I trusted and counted on. They couldn't take me being annoying and now constantly depressed and having a low self esteem. The following 2 days I lost my final 3 friends. These 3 friends had been my friends for years. They were going off on me when I mentioned that I wanted to start a cancer fundraiser. I ordered a shirt that said "the path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell" "right to the top" and on the back it said "I'm never changing who I am", some words from probably the most inspiring song that really gives off a message. They started going off on me when I showed them that I had ordered a shirt and then I showed them a picture of it from the site. They said "well then your always going to be annoying and creepy. Your never going to get out of your depressive state" "your the reason your in this situation". I have tried explaining to them, I've showed them articles and information about ADHD, how it makes me impulsive and really annoying. They just said stop using that as an excuse. They continued to bash me until I couldn't take it and then blocked them both. Ending two friendships that I've had for so long.  I've now no longer have any friends. I lost my only friends when I needed them the most. My depression has worsened although I have been able to keep out the suicidal thoughts. No body in my school likes me. They all think I'm annoying. Extremely annoying. I'm constantly being given faces by kids and have to always see the kids that made me depressed and harassed me on a weekly basis. I can't control my ADHD anymore. Medication doesn't work. Nothing works anymore. Imagine dragons is so inspiring to me and it motivates me to keep pushing through. Even when things get hard. The only I've got to look up to is my future. Being an astronaut and an aerospace engineer for NASA. I just wanted to share my story of how my life was ruined slowly by a mental illness that I was diagnosed with 10 years ago. How I can't change and am unable of blending in with society. How my life collapsed on me.
784fa53f18e1cb8a7e720eb4b51801c7e9e9e24e1063bddadf4846c9937c00f2;;;Anything I should look for in a counselor for ADHD?;;;Ok, so here's the backstory I guess. I've been diagnosed with ADHD of some sort by my PCP, most likely PI or C. I've been on medication for almost a year. Previously Strattera, which had too many side effects, and currently Adderall XR which I've handled much better. I'm at 20 mg in the morning only and I'm doubtful a medication increase would do much at this point, though I could be wrong. I'm more interested in counseling/coaching at this point since I just cried and hollered at my poor mom for the last hour since I just found out I failed a licensing exam for my profession. I've failed other licensing exams previously, which is how I came to the diagnosis in the first place at the age of 25.      Anyways, I'm looking at a list of counselors in the area and frankly don't know what I need to be looking for. CBT seems to come up a lot, but is there anything else I should look for? Or would trying to find a psychiatrist be better? (Very difficult in the area, have tried and failed to previously)  TL;DR: What should I look for in a counselor for ADHD? Or should I just find a psychiatrist?

How do you all read without having to go over the sentence 2 to 6 times.;;;My eyes tend to flicker off the page if I read for awhile.  Can't comprehend a sentence in the form of a question on a test unless I read it 2 or 6 times.   Can't watch educational videos or listen to lectures because I have to listen to music while I study or its unbearable yet when I read I can't retain it.  Even typing I will tend to forget what i was typing so I have to reread it to figure out what i was going to say next.  How do you all get by.  I was thinking of going back on medication but I gives me paranoia and anxiety to the extent that I am too terrified to speak and feel like my life is going down the drain because I think that I am not smart enough to continue my major in IT.  tl;dr  Can't focus on anything  Need music to drive me to study but it conflicts with how i learn which is through audio and visual.

It's been over two months and I'm up to 450mg which apparently is the highest dose I can get.       I can definitively say that it did help with my depression as I don't get down days as much anymore but I still feel very unfocused and distracted. It feels like it did nothing to help with my ADHD.   Does Wellbutrin take a long time to kick in or should I ask my doc about stopping Wellbutrin and explore other options?      tl;dr: Was prescribed Wellbutrin to help with both my ADHD and depression. Don't feel like it helps with my ADHD.

It's even more frightening to realize how my functionality can be easily taken away.   https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/3kip78/how_should_i_go_about_getting_on_medication_again/  So I called and left a message to my so called current provider and she refuses to address my ADHD till my next scheduled meeting and accused me of cheating on a drug screen. I feel so frustrated. How can someone be so dismissive of my needs? What if I had been taking classes? It felt like my brain was melting the first couple of days. Now I feel better. But I don't know where to start now.  I spent several months of testing and referrals to get my diagnosis and I don't want to go through that expense again. Would it possible for an emergent clinic to provide refills till I become settled with a new PCP? I don't even know who to choose. It feel like grabbing names at random and hoping for the best.
7fff2ed78b03783b6d05a8b6afe131da01aa0d2de247b1607f18cfb95c420457;;;Letter to my child.;;;Over the Summer I thought you were  great. Don't get me wrong I always think you're great, but in the Summer I'm generally over the moon with how wonderful you are. In the Summer nobody tells me you're disruptive, difficult. No seven year olds stop me to say you are weird or gross. My perfect boy with impossibly long eye lashes and blue eyes as clear as water. Ticklish and sweet. I love you, too Mommy every night. Then August comes and you're thrown off the school bus for distracting the driver. Then the IEP meetings start and all those hours of bedtime stories and the kindergarten homework that took three hours to complete have amounted to an almost seven year old who can identify 20 out of 26 letters who is supposed to already be reading. When I ask you how was school you ignore me or say it was okay, but with some extra prodding you tell me nobody wants to play with you and you don't know why. Then you ask me, can we make a rule at school that somebody has to play with me? Mommy? That's when I choke back tears and wonder if those other kids' parents ever taught their kids to love and accept others the way I taught you. I daydream about running away, maybe Iceland? You're a good little skier. I want to take you somewhere where they can't reject you or hurt you. My baby boy I had so much hope for you and I feel the world is crushing you. I see the weight of it on your little fifty pound frame and that zombie look in your eyes where pure joy used to live. I'll ask the pediatrician for different medications and maybe one to get us through homework so there's still enough daylight for you to go out and play with the only children in your life who haven't rejected you. I'll put the occupational therapist on credit. I'll read to you even longer at night. I'll google to find new, new and inventive ways to help kinesthetic learners. New ways, maybe this time it'll stick. You're so curious! Always asking how and why, always hungry for more knowledge about the world. We will google that and we will go on YouTube and we will learn where wind comes from and how magnets work. You're so smart, why is this so hard? I love you, my baby Bear.    I have to preface by saying I'm embarrassingly bad at posting to reddit, but I just figured out how to edit my post, it's the small victories! Two nights ago I sat down on my couch and let all my heart spill out in a desperate plea for commiseration and understanding. I bawled until my husband insisted I should get some sleep. Sometimes that's all you need to see yourself and situation more clearly, just let it all out. The next morning I woke up and the gloom of the day before was still hanging around. I chose to do what I always do, I remembered who I am and who my child is and is not. Then I hesitantly chose to see if anything had been said on my post. In the last two days I have made an appointment for myself and my child to see psychologists, I have researched and implemented new study strategies for my son, I signed him up for swim lessons, I invited his entire class and all the neighborhood kids to his birthday party, I signed him up for a Lego building group at the library and I had his doctor adjust his medication dosage. I know fully well that all my efforts could blow up in my face, but seeing the kindness, empathy and generosity of all of you helped me to find the strength to move forward once more. You have nothing to gain from what you've said or done but you did it because you have the power to make other people realize their worth and potential that's an opportunity that we too often pass up. I'm glad you decided to take the time to wish us well.   I was surprised to find I had been given reddit gold for this post. I was also surprised at how much that gesture lifted my spirits. I've been inspired to find opportunities to raise others' spirits in the same way. Thank you so much for your compassion and generosity.

I've never come to the conclusion that I could have ADHD. Now I'm trying to find what's wrong with me. My psychiatrist refuses to diagnose me, but from what I've read, it's obvious that I have ADHD. My mom is very supportive yet she thinks I'm hopeless. I've been like this my entire life, and I am starting to believe her. I'm boxed in psychologically, physically, financially, etc. I can't go anywhere because I don't have any money. My insurance does not allow me decent care. I am obligated to stay below  $1364 per month to retain my "health care". I have begun taking the generic for Adderall XR, which really helps. All I know is that I can't stay here; my future depends on it! As far as employment goes, I've lost count of how many jobs I've had. I've tried to retrain for a different field (academic portion did great, clinical experience not so much). Pursuing Vocational Rehab currently; I know there is something I can do or retrain for  to support myself. I could ramble on forever but I must get to bed. Thanks for any assistance. Have a great day.

I already miss some class due to financial conflict with school.  WHAT i am trying to do right now ? look for a new doctor and have  he /she refer me to a new psychiatrist WHILE class is starting.  I have a few choices i can make to pull through this semester:  1.DROP the class and take the same class on Saturday instead, so that i wont be behind on that class too much.  2.DROP my class and start again next semester when i am have my med.  3.STICK with my class, focus most of my time on it and quit one of my jobs and go see therapy provided by the school while looking for a doctor   TL;DR Should i just drop my classes because i don't have the med nor the psychiatrist or just take it on Saturday instead without med?

I want to go to a physician, however i am scared to be rejected in some way by him.  I am wodering if it is possible to be hypoactive and hyperactive at the same time. Is it possible that the hyperactivity is induced or amplified by modern media like tv, videogames and internet.  I just feel so confused about my behaviour and my feelings. When i feel energetic and want to use it for something important, the energy instantly fades away.

So Sunday I figured I'd read the chapter to be prepared. Never got around to finishing the chapter..  I also procrastinated making this post...

A lot of computer programmers like to have music on in the background when they're working, but if it's the wrong *kind* of music, it can be more distracting than helpful.  Too many lyrics, or too many of certain kinds of changes... it can just drag you right out of your task.  I'm a programmer who has ADHD (first diagnosed as an adult over 20 years ago), and I started listening to this stuff, and I found that it helps me a little bit when I want to focus on *anything*.  The pieces I've listened to are kinda ambient background-type stuff, without lyrics, and without sudden changes in tempo or volume or anything like that.  Sometimes, they help me block out some background distractions without being distracting themselves, which has been great.  Anyhow, here's the link:  http://musicforprogramming.net  (I'm not involved with it, just a "satisfied customer", if that term makes sense for a thing that's free.)

So basically I will fall asleep at some time during the day whatever I am doing, except I am outside or with friends. Some days its better some days worse and I just won't wake up through the day and feel like falling asleep again for the first 10 hours.   Back in school I was struggling to stay awake during the earlier classes and took a nap when I got home, so this isn't really a new occurence.   Also I immediately start dreaming vividly for about 10-20 minutes then i wake up.    I also score really high on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (about 19 points)   so I was wondering if this is beyond ADHD because I don't see it getting mentioned too often.

Thank you in advance for all your help - this sub has been such a help and relief for me over the past few months.  Backstory: I'm 25. Got diagnosed with ADHD in May after I started having severe stomach problems. Drinking 6 cups of coffee a day to function (self-medication) was taking it's toll. Started on adderall IR. First 10, then 20, then 30, then 35, then back to 25 and now been at around 30-35 a day. I take 15-20 in AM and 15 in PM at 1. I have a comedown around 5pm (lose all motivation, get really introverted, face feels hot) so I normally head home despite having more work to do. Drink a cup of coffee around 6 to get me thru the evening and then bed around 11.  Adderall lasts me roughly 3-4 hours, unfortunately. I read a bit of XR and decided to ask my doc for it. He has now given me 20mg XR and a 15mg booster IR in the afternoon, which I'll start tomorrow. He said XR should last roughly 8-10 hours. I want to avoid the comedown which is why i asked for the IR booster - I get so introverted that I cancel my night plans with friends just to sit at home. Really not good...especially because pre-adderall i was never introverted.  - How long do you find XR lasts? - How's the comedown? Do you have it? - Do you prefer taking IR and then XR in late morning, or XR then IR booster? - How do you drink coffee? Or do you not? &lt;-- I can't decide if I should have a cup then XR, or XR then a cup...i just want to make sure I only have roughly 1-1.5 cups a day, max - How's ur mood balance/stability in comparison to xr and IR?  He's given me 20mg XR + 15mg IR because he thought XR would give me 20mg in my body for 10 hours...but it's basically two 10mg IRs (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2547091/) so im sure ill be back in a few days asking for 30mg XR lol  Advice/help?
db28eeb9a397a1ab82df6ac127595355dd1a7609d993e8cd9deed27ce4680fdc;;;Anxiety about seeing GP for initial questions;;;Hi all,  I am a 23 y/o Male and have never been diagnosed with any mental problems. Up until the last 6 months I didn't even know what ADHD was, recently I've been having major problems focusing and prioritizing tasks at work and at home. I graduated college last year after 5 straight years with summer school and normal semesters. I have always been a sub par student my entire life ( C's get degrees eh? ) but managed to make it through school. When I was in high school my parents originally sent me to a private school but I couldn't keep up academically or socially with my peers so I moved to public school after my freshman year. I then proceeded to not care / get C's and F's and somehow managed to get into a decent state school for college. I set the bar high and started with an engineering major, 3 semesters later I dropped out of that school (due to bad grades) and went back to my home town at a lesser known university and studied computer science. I managed to make it through all of my classes with low B-s and C-s ( I failed calc 2 four different times). I never thought I had a problem and that I was just slower then all my peers but I recently found out my older brother has ADHD and has been medicated for years. He told me about some of the problems he had and they are so similar to mine I want to get checked out by the doc to see what's up. I have never talked to anyone about mental problems i've had and am pretty nervous about telling my doctor about what's going on.   Some things that are affecting me at the moment:  - I have a new job, I'm a programmer and lately I've been assigned to work on about 5 different projects. Each one of these projects has tasks, anytime I'm working on a task and a co worker comes by to brief me on another task I immediately gain anxiety and begin working on it (neglecting the original task) this causes me to have a spider web of tasks which take me forever to complete because I get so distracted and worked up over new tasks that get brought to me.  - I constantly get up and walk around in the middle of tasks at work because I need to 'take a break' putting me further behind. This happens around 10-15 times a day.  - The only way I completed anything in school or work is by making ridiculous lists. It's good to have a record but I could be using that time to work...  - I always feel terrible when I wake up and when I get off of work. By terrible I mean I dread going to work (my job isn't even bad) and Afterward I can't even make myself clean my room.  - I buy random shit I don't need on impulse now that I have a job and am out of school. (Really trying hard to stop this one) not just small things I bought a brand new car as soon as I got my job because I think I was in what I've read is a 'Mania' stage or something ...  - I hyper focus on things that should not be a priority and then feel bad about it later ( this post )  Did you guys have anxiety as well when first going to the doctor? I've never talked to anyone about this and half way feel like I'm just slow.
3de5179ab8dd141da5b53296ba1f02868ada1a9856cbe8c7b9768313f3312981;;;Just another career advice post..;;;I know this sub gets a fair amount of these types of posts, however I'm feeling a bit lost lately and figured it couldn't hurt to ask Reddit! First, a little bit about me! I'm 26 and was given my (at the time ADD, now termed ADHD-PI) diagnosis at age 8, subsequently I was put on Ritalin followed by concerta and have finally settled on adderall about 10 years ago.  I've held jobs in several fields of work and have not gone without a job in 9 years. I have a AAS from a local tech school in automotive repair and have a fair amount of other schooling that I have attempted (read: get bored and stop going) as well.  My true passion has always been cars and anything mechanical/motorized. When I was younger, I was very into computers and loved taking things apart (sometimes I'd even put them back together!!! Lol). Currently I work for a local major aerospace manufacturer and have been here over 4 years.  During my time here I've held an entry level manufacturing job, as well as been a team lead (focus and time intensive position here) and acceled decently at it for someone with my attention span. Currently I'm working as an electrical systems install tech and find my attention not being held by the tasks at hand no matter how I try and organize/ plan out my day..  What I'd like to hear from you, Reddit, is suggestions as to what I should do about my waning interest in my current 'career', as well as other career paths that I could persue that may be unknown to me at this time! Thanks for reading my life story..

I recently started on Zoloft for my depression, and I feel like it's made my ADHD 10 times worse. I'm all scatterbrained, my focus is much worse, I'm fidgety and jittery and all over the place on time management.  Im only a week into Zoloft, so I'm likely still getting side effects, but has anyone else found antidepressants magnifying their ADHD symptoms?   I almost feel like my depression may have been an unconscious coping mechanism to slow down my ADHD.

I was diagnosed with ADHD around the age of 28, I'm 31 now. I've been seeing my family doctor and using Adderall XR to treat my symptoms for the last 2 years. I've never felt like the meds did much other than take the edge off my symptoms which was fine before I started taking on more responsibility in our family business.   &amp;nbsp;  Fast forward to this year. I'm the sales manager out our company, I do all of our tech work and I report quarterly sales figures (ugh I hate data entry). I've got strict deadlines to meet and people counting on me to get things done. I've also managed to piss of my sister and brother-in-law by being not so dependable. To put the icing on the cake their morning people who are frustrated with my old routine of come in around 9 AM and work later than everyone else. They get pissed if I'm not in the building by 7:45.                                                                          &amp;nbsp;  So I made the decision to finally get some extra help. I met with my new doctor last Friday and I feel like the first appointment went well. It was more of a "getting to know you" meeting. Lots of questions to establish what type of ADHD I have and to get us comfortable with each other. I go back next week for my second appointment.                             &amp;nbsp;  I'll keep everyone updated on how this helps with my ability to live and work with ADHD. If anyone has questions about my progress or what it's like working with a psychologist and a normal doctor feel free to ask.  I'd also love to get some advice on how to get the most out of this from people who have been there and done that. &amp;nbsp;                                                                                                                                                              &amp;nbsp;      **TL:DR - I finally decided to meet with a psychologist about my ADHD so that I don't get fired from work and destroy family relationships. If anyone has been on the fence about seeing this sort of Dr. feel free to ask me questions as I go through my treatment. Also would love to get advice from people who have had this type of treatment on how to make the most of it.**        Thanks. &amp;nbsp;  Jason  &amp;nbsp;  PS. Sorry about the lack of paragraph breaks. Reddit seems to like making it hard to format a post.

(concerta) diagnoses: Aspergers, dyslexia and Adhd;;;I've been for the past year starting to use my adhd medication, despite the fact that I was diagnosed when I was 6.    I admit, taking the medication really helps my concentration and cognitive abilities, but lately, I've been thinking a lot of those times when I've accidentally taken too much. around 70+ mg of Concerta. What usually tends to happen is that an hour or two later, my cognitive abilities were going crazy and entered a trance of what I would refer to as "Mental Overclocking" It is just as it sounds. I was able to search for ANY form of information in my mind. Any word, any ekvation was at my disposal like a google search and I was significantly better at multi-tasking several different thoughts with accurate conclusions.    **KEEP IN MIND**: That it's not solely due to my adhd medication that I was able to achieve this level of mental and cognitive capability. I am also diagnosed with Aspergers and Dyslexia.    What I've noticed over the years is that my Aspergers helps me think and calculate on a unique level, which is similar if not completely like (depending the severity of their autism/aspergers). However, due to my other conditions such as Adhd and Dyslexia, I am unable to focus on a subject, save the information and use it when the time comes, you could say that my other diagnoses work together to repress my aspergers.    But when I take too much adhd medication, it completely nullifies any trace of my adhd and it also decreases if not completely removes my dyslexia while under the effect of mental overclocking. I remember very clearly that my personality was greatly changed and my brain was working without bounds in every sense of the word. There wasn't anything I couldn't learn, calculate or store in my brain. But that's also the side effect is that I would experience an inability to stop thinking, or as Cortana (halo 4) put it best. "Experience rampancy, where we literally think ourselves to death."     Though thankfully not to the same degree, I can distinctly remember that when I didn't read, watch or conversate, I was being VERY agitated by my mind's several multi-tasking thoughts that were constantly branching off like a hydra having its head cut off. One topic branches into two, two into four, four into eight ect. It required a heavy amount of control to stop this form of rampancy and I quickly hypothesized, theorised and confirmed that if I could focus on a topic with more effort than just background multi-tasking, then I could control the pain. I kept this up until the effect died down. I had a three day headache after that, a slight ache in my heart and intestines during the aftermath. It's been several months since then and I have kept my distance of medication due to the side-effects of "Mental overclocking"   I have to know if someone with the same diagnoses as me as experienced something similar if not entirely like this. Because I am starting university soon as an Electrical Engineer and I am curious to see if I could experiment further to see if I could not only control "Mental overclocking" by increasing my chemical tolerance, but also if it can be used as a potential treatment for people with the same diagnoses as myself. Adhd, Aspergers and Dyslexia (combined)  **P.S** sorry for wall of text, can't really find the format to put space between paragraphs.   **TL;DR** Have any of you ever experienced something similar with taking too much adhd medication? and if so, please be go into as much detail as you want. Any info is good info.  **UPDATE** Fml, after three hours of research, I found out that due to the combination of diagnosis with learning and processing information, I have NLD Nonverbal learning disorder. I am a perfect match for 90% of the symptoms. This makes me hypothesise that my medication is making me shed my restriction of NLD.

The problem says to use 3, 4-sided dice and i misread it and solved it using 4, 6-sided dice. Unfortunately, last year's homework was the same problem but with the numbers changed; 4, 6-sided dice. It looks as though I slipped up while plagiarizing, but all I did was misread the problem.  I've always had problems with working too quickly, misreading problems, all that stupid shit i never thought really mattered. I'm diagnosed ADHD and Tourette's and I am often very impatient, so I work very quickly. I am also very good at math, which helps me work quickly.  Nobody believes me but my friends. I keep getting rejected by administration and now i have one final chance, the appeal, to prevent a mark on my record and large point reduction in the class. The deans i ask for advice tell me people in the appeal  hearing are unlikely to understand my argument, that it is convoluted and sounds like im just trying to make excuses.  I feel like shit. There are a lot of factors that caused this but I know it is largely due to my personality. I feel so hopeless and like people like me never make it in society because nobody understands how I am wired.  I just need to vent. I don't think there's much advice to be given here. If there is, please tell me, but i mostly just feel bad about myself.  Thank you for taking the time to read this

If so why? I'm looking to switch to Vyvanse in 3-6 months because I really like the idea that I can eat/drink what i want.. Not that I want to go out and consume a ton of acidic stuff, but it'd be nice to not have to consider when to eat or what to eat.  And has your vyvanse made you focus as good as your adderall xr?

After a month I had a review mentioned my side effects: euphoria, couldn't sleep at night, always jiggling my foot, grinding/clenching teeth.      He said I might be sensitive so my meds changed to 2 doses a day 10mg in the morning 5mg before 12pm.       Euphoria went away, still jiggling the foot, not sleeping, grinding not clenching anymore.    So he cut my dose down to 2, 5mg each and even suggested experimenting myself with microdosing... did that now onto experimenting with microdosing and sleeping meds he prescribed. so currently 2.5mg x 2 once @ 7 once at 11pm. still can't get enough sleep. I don't want to wake in the morning I want moar sleep.      Is this going to go away or do I need to give it longer then 3 months (I have been semi consistent with taking them but I admit on some weekends I was like fuck it I need my sleep). when the meds wear off I feel Im crashing really hard. Any tips on how to get some sleep?

As dopamine is an excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter, which direction it takes depends on the dopamine receptor. According to the website Integrative Psychology, low dopamine levels can cause a host of challenges, as can high dopamine levels. Low dopamine may contribute to depression and poor concentration, where high dopamine can lead to excitability and agitation. There is a reciprocal relationship between sleep and dopamine in that at the same time that dopamine can encourage or prohibit sleep, sleeplessness can increase levels of dopamine."  The last part explain a lot why we function and work so much better at nighttime.   The thing that also hit me was: This means that what we do and the level of interest we have of it, will greatly affect how awake/sleepy we feel. And also, ironically that more/enough sleep will actually make this worse in many ways.  If we don't do something that makes the brain naturally produce dopamine, a good night sleep is your worst enemy.  That would also explain why i get so freaking tired if I dont take my Vyvanse when im supposed to (early enough). And also why I was so tired on too low doses of Ritalin in the beginning. Not to talk about the "rebounce effect" when the medication wear off.

My appointment will be in a few days when I'm home from school and I'm just wondering what to expect? My mom or dad will most likely accompany me because I've heard that parents are often questioned as well. I also live in Ontario, Canada if that makes a difference, thanks to any who reply!  TL;DR Live in canada, going to talk to doctor as I strongly feel I may have ADHD  Edit: Also I take 10mg daily of cipralex due to depression and anxiety, I've read that SSRIs can diminish the effects of some ADHD medication, should I mention this to my doctor as well?  Edit 2: Thanks for all the replies guys! Also I know I may not have given much information on why I think I have adhd but I have been doing quite a bit of research and talking to friends who have been diagnosed.

This person is the light of my life and we've been together for a long time. Originally diagnosed as a young adult, this person struggled with initial attempts at medication before they gave up and subsequently forgot all about their ADHD.    A few years ago, during a time when our relationship was fraught with bouts of rage that left me feeling frightened and emotionally drained (especially those that occurred in public) I insisted my partner seek help for anger issues. This led to rediagnosis that was sort of a "Duh!" *palm face* kind of moment for both of us. Since then, with the help of medication my partner has been able to graduate college (!!!) and become more successful in life. I couldn't feel more elated and proud of them. However, medication still doesn't completely eliminate the anger episodes especially during the 1/2 hour window when they've yet to kick in.    My biggest issue is that I grew up in an explosive and angry household and so I have a very low threshold for tolerating angry outbursts. It's really a trigger for me. I admit that I am in part responsible for some of the outbursts that occur. I wanted to know if you folks have any particular advice for avoiding behaviors that act as rage triggers that I might be unaware of. I want to be proactive in minimizing my contribution to my partner's distress and feelings of disrespect.   An example of a recent argument might include the discussion of a topic that I wish to avoid. Let's say this topic is not about the relationship or of a particular sensitive nature, it's just unpleasant and often leads to these sort of outbursts. Politics is a good one. I try to side step the discussion by saying "I don't really want to talk about this" because it's early and I want to start my day off feeling happy. But that is interpreted as being disrespectful "You clearly don't think that *blank*, one of the most critical issues we face is that important." Then, and here's where I made a mistake (aka offering my own opinion) "Actually, I think the environment is more important." Suddenly I'm getting cursed at and it's like 6am. Then I get rude and it's all over until we can both calm down.   How do I step away from these hotspots without convincing my partner that I'm disrespectful and don't care about things that are important to them? I know that I need to have a discussion with my partner, and believe me I will, but we seem to continually struggle with these explosions even though we do communicate well. I'm looking for any outside perspectives you folks have that will help me gain better empathy for how my partner is feeling. I'm also aware that "When you've seen one case of ADHD... you've seen one case of ADHD" but I just want some fresh ideas. I've been scouring the internet but haven't come across anything I haven't seen before.    Thanks in advance!

My doctor was pretty unfamiliar with adult ADHD, but willing to work with me. She prescribed me Adderall, 5mg XR, which I've heard is a very small dose. It had minimal effects, mostly on my energy levels and a barely noticeable increase in focus.  She's since bumped me up to 10mg XR. I've been on that for a month, and I've noticed since the first day any effects I felt from the 5mg are gone, and I'm not really noticing much difference at all. I figured I'd give it time to build up in my system to start feeling the effects, but nothing after a month.   I have an appointment next week and I'm not sure whether or not I should ask her about going back down to the 5mg, or maybe increasing my dosage again. She seems to be looking to me for answers as to what dosage I feel comfortable with, so I wanted to do some research.   Has anyone else experienced something like this? Could the effects of the 5mg have been placebo? I've never taken stimulants before and I'm not sure if they usually fluctuate in effectiveness or what, so any insight is appreciated :)

I've been hyper focused and obsessing in getting back on treatment (medicine)  In the past I had therapy on one side and O monthly well checks on adderal (Blood pressure and check ins to get my monthly prescription)   Ironically after denouncing medicine I have bowed down and had dinner with my demons  I need treatment and I can not fight the good fight any longer the  Financial debt and over due errands are so much that I really shutter to think where I will be  I'm a student a wife and a mother of a toddler and 2 month old  As I have more responsibilities now the solution is more obvious  But I am getting obstacles and calling places that make the appointment take and Bill the insurance then and only then say 1) You can't see a psychiatrist until a month and 2) we are not keen on prescribing stimulants for adult onset add  I do t know what onset is?!  Also a man masquerading even has a site about add you pay him make an appointment then he tells you he does not believe you need a stimulant   Well  Then  I am so far behind on my real responsibilities from dealing with these obstacles that I will need three more days to catch up on my mother wife and student and house stuff  Then I'll start over.   I'm wondering if I should just do self pay and private practice these places seem like they are totally against me and medicine.  Spent all day on phone looking for doctors

Was put on Ritalin IR 3 times daily for two weeks, but it was a rollercoaster of ups and downs for me. Told my psychiatrist about this and he wrote me up on Concerta 54mg.  So far the effect seems very similar. No ups and downs, yet I am still very tired when I come home around 4pm. Too tired to do anything productive with my time (which is basically why i began treatment in the first place.).  I'd like to know from those of you who use Concerta, how were you around 4pm in terms of energy? Is this feeling a part of the package?

Since reading up on ADHD, I've found a lot of the things I read here comforting, knowing that people have actually gone through the exact same stuff that I have.  I'm undiagnosed (so far), but I had an appointment with my GP today and she had me fill out a quick screening (which was very long and boring and confusing, I kept skipping questions out of habit but I got through them!). The preliminary diagnosis is moderate-severe ADHD but she's referred me to get a formal evaluation done. My question, friends, is what should I expect from this?  I'm going to a psychologist in a few weeks* to get it done, and then I'll have to wait a few days to see if the report comes back positive or negative for ADD/ADHD, but I'm nervous about it all. Thankfully you all have been so kind and helpful, so I really appreciate it.
a3c79386bbf4e4560808b84c1de1d7bf088b8feaf419b9ec1a6d8732702db373;;;Finally found something that works for me. I highly recommend buying an expensive pen and an expensive notebook.;;;Work sucked.  I was failing at every turn.  I had started strong a year or two ago and the sophomore slump was killing me.  My boss was up my ass *literally* every single day.  I was thinking about quitting.  I thought to myself "What was I doing differently before?"  The only thing I could think of was that I used to have a nice pen that I liked and a single notebook that I carried EVERYWHERE.  I thought, what the hell, I've exhausted every other possibility, lets give this one a shot.  So I went out on my lunch break and laid down some scratch on a fountain pen (It's a shitty fountain pen, but it was still like $30.  For a pen.) and a Moleskine notebook.  After lunch I unpackaged everything and put the ink in the pen.  Nice, smooth, liquid lines flowed onto paper.  (If you've never written with a fountain pen, I highly recommend it.  You know that satisfaction you get when you use a nice gel roller like a Pilot G2?  Yea.  Its that times a thousand.)   In the 2-3 weeks since I've been complimented, told I'm turning over a new leaf, and had my "Noticable change in communication style" commented on.  Its unreal.  And it all boils down to one thing.   I actually want to write things down now, and I have one central place to write them.  Thats it.  No more sticky notes all over my desk.  No more grabbing a random piece of printer paper to scratch out a quick diagram, no more stacks of notepads that are half used that I need to dig through when I need to get a reminder I wrote.  It's all in that one black leatherbound notebook.  And it's all in order, with dated pages.  In the morning I date a page, and write "Todays Goals."  Then I spend 5 minutes writing things that I need to do (and enjoying it, because writing is fun with nice pens.)  Then that notebook stays on my desk, open to that page, throughout the day.  If I glance in that direction, I'm presented with my list of things to do for the day, and think "Oh hell, that one would be easy to knock out right now lets do that."  I can use my distractability to my advantage because now Im getting distracted by work.    On top of that, it's always there to jot down notes. If someone comes in to talk about something, I take small notes here and there (a key word or two is usually enough to jog your memory later, you dont want them to think youre interviewing them.)  If I go to a meeting, I take it with me.  If I get a call, I jot it down.  If someone asks me about that thing we discussed yesterday, I flip to yesterdays set of pages and have an aide in recalling the conversation.  Something happened on a big project?  That shit gets its own page.    And it all boils down to one thing.  I'm using a pen and pad that's literally a pleasure to write with.  I enjoy it.  I thrive on the looks I get when people notice that I'm using a fountain pen.  It's so satisfying watching the liquid ink slide off the nib and lay up on the page, glossy and wet and black, and then slowly sink into the paper as I continue the sentence.  Its not a chore to make a list or a note anymore, it's enjoyable.   So yea thats my two cents.  Take $50 and blow it on a pen and a pad.  Do research before you buy.  Get excited about it.  There are articles online about the best notebooks.  Heres a good one on size.  http://www.recordingthoughts.com/2012/03/23/what-size-is-the-right-size-for-a-notebook/   You dont want something cumbersome but it still needs to be big enough to write on.  Mines ~5" x 8".  Fits nicely in your hand, and is big enough to hold substantial information on a single page.   Anyway, thats enough of me prattling on about notebooks.  Go do some research.  TL;DR:  Go spend a stupid amount of money on a pen and a notebook.  Youll keep track of them because theyre valuable, you'll use them because they're fun, and those two things put together are way, WAY more valuable to a person with ADHD than $50 is.

Attributing that to the fact my title wasn't related to my actual question. Anyways finally met up with my psychiatrist today and he prescribed me adderall. Is it okay to tell important people I have been diagnosed or should I wait until the follow up appointment in a month. I'm not sure if the adderall will work but he must believe I have adhd which is why he prescribed me right? Or? Sorry I don't know if this is a dumb question.
c6a0814a449ef3bb0df424a0a3563c3f0beb39329381a01fa120a95ab27e1ab6;;;Hello. It's me.;;;Hey guys. I found you a little while ago, and so I'm gonna tell you about me and how I'm doing.  I'm just 15 years old and I like computers and I'm from Europe. I hope my English is good enough, I learned it by Reddit, so thanks. People told me in German and English, that my sentences sound pretty childish, I hope you don't mind. They're misleading, they say. I got problems with any language.  I was diagnosed ADHD when I was 7 years old. It was the time I came back to my parents. I actually was raised by my grandparents, my grandmother was alcoholic. More often, she would be so drunk, that she just would lay around on the floor and shit her pants. Once she broke her leg because of that. My grandfather was also kinda harsh. He threw dinner onto my bed, so I could eat. He also shouted that loud, I couldn't develop speaking well enough.  My parents visited me and my sister like every day. They hated themselves, cause they depended on my grandparents. They knew I was so hyperactive and so on. They tell me now, I'd have been telling them about my problems from early on. I also like computers. They are fascinating. I started with computer with 2, or 4. My first machine was an old IBM PC, then a Windows XP. My parents knew something was wrong, they had a hard time when we would go on vacation. I'd do things really fast all day, and after around 1am I'd just fall asleep. Then, at 6am, I'm awake again. They were not happy.  My grandmother often told me, I shouldn't move so stupid. I was tilting for- and backwards. She just said, "Don't move like that, it's just done by morons!". The kids in my class also don't understand me. But they like me. I even go to a academic high school. I think it's called like that. I was the only one in my primary school. I do hard with talking to other people. My grandmother never got with me to a doctor. Or psychologist. Or whatever they are called.  I also hate school. Even tho I'm not that bad, I often get something like a 'bad point'. It's because I can't contribute in class. It's hard. You know working like a computer? It's like: Input? Yes? No?-&gt;wait(); It's calling wait all the time I have to be silent. And then I'm thinking. And then everything is going on in my head. My feet and hands start making music. I got music in my head all the time. Not like an earworm. It's more like the rhythm of my day. It's hard.  My parents are divorcing now. My father was in prison. He also got ADHD. Just without the H. My mother gave me a book about ADHD she bought when I was diagnosed. It's called ADD+H in there. It's the only book I'm able to read. He does understand many things in my disorder, but he's not the best in taking good care of the ones, he thinks I just made up. Like, I can't take responsibility in anything. More responsibility = less power = passing out. But he told me, we would fix that. I'm going to a psychologist next week or so. I was in a mental hospital for three weeks once and got Methylphenidate. It's pretty common here to get that drug when being diagnosed with ADHD. But my grandmother quit my therapy, she didn't like my behavior?  I like computers. When I'm working on a computer, I'm working as fast as my brain likes to. I like shortcuts on the keyboards and I'm programming in Java, PHP, and C. I'd like to learn Assembler, but I can't. I love Web Design. I just like that shit. Working with the computer is like telling the color of my desk. It's just like there for me, like talking my mother tongue. Or some people can listen to a song and tell you the musical notes. Wow. I was always impressed by them. I'd like to play the piano, but I couldn't learn that, I got a pretty low motor skill, even I'm good at soccer, when I'm getting the ball back to my team, else I don't know what soccer is.  The kids in my class are impressed by what I do, and how, but I don't know why. Some seem even jealous. They would tell me I got no hobbies, but that's just youth telling everyone they can't do something. I like girls much more than boys, I don't just mean romantically or in that kinda thing, but just talking with them makes much more sense. Except the two girls in class who are trying to catch other's attention by badmouthing. Yeah, thanks. You got me every time. -.-  Today, we had Math test, and at the beginning I couldn't read the text, because the Math teacher told the supervisor instructions. I'd have been strangling them, when they'd have talked any second more! It's fucking hard!! I can't do the test. I hate the Math teacher, he's like my grandmother, he can't accept his own faults, especially when told by me. What the hell, he made like three math problems, which are not even solvable. He's even more stupid than the geography teacher. And she's really thick.  I don't know why, I'm the only one dressing well in class. I'm the only one wearing a nice, long tie and a shirt. I like being complimented on it, It doesn't look nerdish, more fashionable. But why doesn't every one wear that. I don't understand. You could tell I'm really childish. I'm like stuck in childhood, I never gone beyond that very far. I mean, they laugh at me when I tell them my favorite programme is still SpongeBob SquarePants. I like him on TV. What the hell. That's why people might like me, but with that I won't go any far and I'm teased by that, I think. Have you ever been told of an SpongeBob-phile computer taking advantage of other computers to do useless tasks to be a computer? Sorry.

What moment positively changed your outlook/productivity?;;;What did your family members do that was most/least useful? What moment positively changed your outlook/productivity?   My brother (21) was diagnosed a year ago with ADHD and serve depression. He is extremely intelligent, always had top marks, but broke down about this time last year over finals and had to leave Uni. Previously the family assumed he just procrastinated when he stayed up all night trying to write an essay, or was burnt out from working so hard.   Since he's been diagnosed my mother has been VERY supportive, trying to help in anyway possible; patiently trying to help with his homework, create schedules to finish work, transport him to the gym (as he doesn't drive and it helps his concentration), and everything else under the sun. She, and the rest of us simply don't know what else we can do to help, and it's horrible to watch someone you care for so much, with unlimited potential, be miserable.   He has a great psychiatrist, therapist, and recently got a life coach. His medications have certainly helped him improve, but he isn't happy or close to fully functioning. We all know he is trying his best, but at this point can't figure out what will help him. He practices a lot of avoidance strategies (ie it's time for homework and suddenly he has to eat/sleep/go to the gym) and has difficulty even going through the motions of an average day.  My question is what helped you, personally, the most through your experience? And what did your family members do to help/hurt the process?
071d7feb79b98814d194bdb93f7a7a67c062df7113c7aa533ab8cebb48d81391;;;Storytime;;;I feel like this is something a good many people come here and do but I feel compelled to anyway.  This is me: I'm 25. I was diagnosed in my early school years as ADD around 1st when I was getting in trouble for all the usual things; not paying attention, acting up, distracting myself, drawing all over everything. Over the next few years I was medicated off and on. Ritalin, Adderall, Concerta are the ones I remember. And they worked for the most part. I did quite well up until about middle or age 11.   One summer my family decided I didn't show symptoms any longer and didn't take me to a doctor anymore. They said it went away, a popular thought at the time. We also became progressively poor after that. My sixth grade year I started to slip. I paid less attention in class and struggled through my days, but I got first chair clairnet in band and remained the spotlight (gifted) class. And I passed, but it sucked and it was a lot harder than before.  The next year it got worse. I almost failed some important classes but i scratched by. I dropped band for a study hall and got in trouble for not keeping up with all of my classes. By the time of my freshman high school I was completely spent. I failed that year, having spent much of my time sleeping in class. I nearly stopped drawing altogether, something I used to have a lot of fun practicing. (In fact, now that I think about it, while medicated was when I was really putting effort into learning. Hm.)  Fast forward to now. (and really just to keep this from being way too lomg.) I failed the same year of high school four times in a row and was allowed to get my GED to get out. (I scored rather high on it btw) Worked dead end BS jobs for a few years at a time. Had about a 3 year "party period" where I smoked a lot of pot, cigarettes, and drank. I met a wonderful woman for whom I quit all of that.  After 4 years, I'm divorced after mistreating my wife (though we are still great friends just romantically involved) and I get to see my daughter every other weekend. Having never really lived on my own, I'm fully realizing the repercussions of not recognizing or treating my ADD and I'm in horrible shape because of it. I don't remember to pay my bills on time (my late rent has been in my wallet for a few weeks now), my house is a mess, my phone is broken and I haven't replaced it, my car is scrapped and I haven't towed it. My job of 3 years see me as skilled but lazy. My license is suspended because of tickets I kept forgetting to pay, and I've already been arrested and owe the local city over a thousand dollars by the beginning of next month. And under the pressure of all of this I've contemplated suicide several times over the past year, because I don't want to be a burden on anyone anymore. But like when I felt the same as a teenager I've always been too scared to do anything, I just fantasize.  But I've dreamt of doing so much with my life. I've fallen in love with and researched so many things from making music to starting a podcast or becoming a historian. From becoming a tattoo artist and eventually opening my own shop to owning a bookstore or cafe. I've looked into becoming an actor, a writer, a voice over artist. But I can never settle myself on one thing. I either get bored and move on or figure a reason I can't do it, usually money.  So I guess I've really come to this subreddit for help. Kinda desperate help. I don't really have many close friends and I'm just really lonely when it comes down to it. I keep pushing or keeping people away because I don't want to hurt anyone else, but then I also know I really need help.   TL;DR ADD is ruining my life and might actually kill me one day.

I usually take my 3rd dose sometime after 3 before 6. Today I took it at 4:45-5. I swallowed it with a gulp of water and didn't think much of it. Well, fast foward to 8:15 in math and I'm not feeling anything, I feel the fog. I was getting distracted. I was clearly not on it at all. I then remembered that i had a water bottle..chugged half of it, and 5 minutes later I feel like the adderall hit. Is this a thing? Or am I making this up and I just have myself all psyched out for nothing..
46641bea57eede274f877b7df34c4bb7486e915484c0ea2e026afa1210631cc9;;;Questions about post med risks.;;;So I was diagnosed with ADD when I was around 13-14. If I remember right I was given instant release ritalin, probably 10mgs or so. When I was maybe 16 I stopped taking my meds, and started again in college when I was 18. That time I was given extended release 18mg ritalin. Now I'll admit I may have abused them a bit in college, possibly more than I remember since I am more educated on the matter now. I remember a terrible bout of depression and anger and suicidal thoughts a few months after stopping again. However now that I am 21, I have come to realize that I am clinically depressed and have some mild anger issues. I used to be the most fun loving, outgoing-est kid that ever lived. Ever since ritalin, life has seemed dull, sort of grey. I often find myself abusing drugs and partying to seek real pleasure, when simply going fishing would make me happy as a clam. Not that any of this is necessarily cause by ritalin directly, but I wonder if my brain never really "reset". If going back to my doctor and getting ritalin again would make me feel normal, then this is not a problem. I guess I am just curious if anyone else has had similar concerns. Thank you all who read this! TL:DR Used to take ritalin, now my brain is fucked :(

The way she said she 'suspects' made me think she couldn't give me the official diagnosis yet. I'm hoping I can get diagnosed and eventually medicated.   But do LCSW's need to refer for further evaluation, or can they render a diagnosis that could be referred for medication?    Any help in understanding the process is appreciated, thanks.

I went to my GP for anxiety, and was prescribed paxil, which helped but I told the GP that I still had trouble focusing.  So she referred me to a psychologist for ADHD testing.    Took two months to get the test and results.  I didn't get to look at the results, whatever they were, but the psychologist, who I only spoke to for 10 minutes when he gave me his diagnosis, said I didn't have signs of any deficit, and kind of insinuated that I was too smart to have ADHD.  He said the reason my grades were low was that I spend too much time watching TV and playing video games, both of which I have a hard time doing because I can't sit down and pay attention to them for that long.  When I am sitting down to study I study in short bursts, but end up wasting a lot of time checking stuff I think of while trying to focus on my work.  (Bank account balances, what the prices are on something I've been thinking about buying, buying stuff I don't need, etc.)    In the end, after saying "He thinks.., no he *knows* I don't have ADHD" he said I just need to work on my self-discipline and that my lack of focus is because of my anxiety.  It kind of got me down because I got my hopes up that I would be able to get treatment for this problem.  I pictured myself being able to sit down and play video games without getting bored, or work on my hobbies without getting distracted with 20 different things I don't really care about.  Sorry for the wall of text, but it's been bothering me.  Anything I  should do?  Or should I take his advice, which is pretty much what I've already known and have been trying to work on to no avail?  Maybe I really don't have ADHD and I'm just lazy and impulsive?

I'm at a complete loss.;;;On my meds I do actually start tasks, but I'm so damn inefficient and get barely nowhere, even after hours of 'work'.  I'm thinking/understanding quickly for maybe 45 minutes, and then just slip off into hours of mental blurriness and inefficiency.   Before diagnosis/meds I almost never started or did anything, but in the times I actually did (i.e at the absolute last second), I was so incredibly efficient.   Example A - on meds:   Assignment due in 2 weeks. Leave it to last 3 **days**, spend 16 **hours** on only 1 section of it (taking ages to understand content or make progress, as well as getting constantly sidetracked on unimportant things), barely start the other sections, even the 1 section I did wasn't very good. = Failed the assignment.   Example B - before diagnosis/meds:  Assignment due in 2 weeks, leave it to the last 1.5 **hours**, work at 110% efficiency in those 1.5 hours, lazer focused  (+ could understand/learn things so quickly) --&gt; Get mark of 75% on the assignment.   I've tried both Ritalin and Dextroamphetamine (my current medication), at all the different doses. I'm at a complete loss. My psychiatrist thinks since I'm actually doing things (overall I am doing more, although still not very much) i'm going well, but it feels like I used to be really smart and just unable to make myself do anything, but now I'm unintelligent and slow to learn/understand things, and the work I do is such low quality.   Does anyone have any advice/input that could help?   Side note: I'm always really mentally fatigued/exhausted when not on meds, it's such an incredible struggle to overcome that barrier of fatigue to even think about or do anything, in addition to the other typical issues.  HOWEVER, I **was** definitely like this before diagnosis/meds.

When I was in 1st grade my teacher noticed it and called in my mom to talk about. Needless to say, my mom ripped her a new one and that diagnosis was never made. My academics was never a problem, it was always focusing. I look into people's eyes and listen to them speak but my mind is always somewhere else. I can't wake up in the morning. I've *never* been able to do this. It almost cost me my diploma when I was a senior and my mom couldn't get me up anymore. Through some luck, I managed to pass and graduate. I now have a full time job and a new apartment. This is the biggest struggle. Knowing that I could lose everything because I can't get up and I can't focus. My job requires a lot of memorization and focus. I've been doing well up until now but I feel like I'm slipping. I was late today; I can't be late again. What should I do?

I was diagnosed when I was 6 with adhd and dyslexia. My mother overdosed me and I suffered mentally because of it. She stopped when I was 9 and ever since I refused to accept that I had a Learning Disorder, now a few semesters of college and it's kicked my butt. I finally went to the DSP office at my school and now I am sitting in a waiting room waiting to see a doctor to start the process to get diagnosed again.
36f13c21cc93e77919fdb60a235ed6ea70d6aa531cbf9adff747ace3e9715947;;;Been taking Adderall for ADD (or ADHD) for 2 months. No effect.;;;   Well recently I was diagnosed with ADD after I went to my doctor due to inability to focus or do anything that i'm not interested in for over 5 minutes. Random times where I stand or sit there staring into space thinking not even realizing i'm doing it till around 5 minutes have passed. The worst part is I keep getting unmotivated when attending school because I know i'm not going to hear 70% of it and I have to battle myself forcing my view on the board to listen only to end up staring at the board but thinking about something completely different that is irrelevant to what is being said and don't realize that i'm not listening till something calls me back into focus.   Ok now recently I've been seeing a Psychiatrist and I have reason to believe he thinks I'm just a junkie college kid who wants to get a prescribed a drug for recreational use. Now something about me, I hate weed because it impairs me and I hate the feeling of impairment. I hate alcohol because it messes with my judgement. I have my every day inability to focus because it impairs my ability to learn what I need to learn so that my 3,000 a semester doesn't go to waste. So he started me first on 5mg of Ritalin, at first I was scared because Ritalin was a infamous drug to me where it turned kids into zombies (My younger cousin had it a long time ago) so I was scared that it would just make me stand there unable to do function so I was hesitant to take it, but I took it as directed. Nothing happened so he moved me to a Anti Depressant / Bipolar medication. I said "I am not depressed or bipolar why would I take this" he insisted it will help my ADD. I was on it for almost 2 months and he kept pushing the dosage from 100, 200, 300, 400 till I said "Look it's not working" and he said "It will eventually work, we just keep going higher" I think he kept trying to push this thing because he didn't want me on stimulant medication. After I stood up to him and said "Look stop this isn't working I have 0 effects it isn't helping at all" he stopped and said "What do you want to take then?" Now I was hesitant to suggest a drug because it seemed like a trap where he was trying to get me to confess that I was only there for drugs but in reality he's the fucking doctor who's suppose to help me but I only feel like i'm there to maintain his income.      After some talking I started on 10mg of Adderall XR. I was taking Generic since my insurance does not cover brand name. I took that for 2 weeks 1 time a day and 0 effect. I spoke to him again he increased my dosage to 20mg of XR for 2 weeks. Nothing. after that I came back and he increased my dosage to 30 mg. Now at this point I was getting frustrated because he said "This is the highest dosage I can give" and I took them for 1 week and STILL no effect. After a bit I got frustrated and just took 2 of the 30mg Adderall pills (60mg) to see if there was any effect at all. Nothing. On 60 mg of Adderall XR I have 0 effect. None of the side effects are present either. No Euphoria, No jitters, No lack of sleep (I actually took a nap after 3 hours of taking the 60mg) and no loss of appetite. I tried 60 MG of adderall the next day and same thing no effect. Then 1 more time and nothing. After this I ran out so I just went without it for 4 days. The most recent visit to the doctor he was talking me and I didn't tell him about the 60 MG (That's what he would love to hear that I took more drugs than I was suppose to to get high when in reality I want results) and I said "Look I have 0 effect on it. Nothing changes at all, I have no increase in focus, no loss of appetite, no loss in sleep and he just snooty replied "It isn't for decrease in appetite it's for focus" at that point I just told him "I am aware of that i'm telling you this because the drug goes in and it has 0 effect at all. It does nothing good or bad i'm starting to think you have me on a Placebo or something"  which he just stood quiet and said "We're going to go up a little more and if it doesn't work we're going to try something else" At this point i'm starting to question his competence. Does he know how to treat ADD? I'm on 40mg adderall xr taking it as directed and nothing. Has this happened to anyone before? Maybe i'm being irrational?
8aafda81bbad54671b1a310f0c09538a60863fc7d4761458e0b288e8b602faa4;;;Can't seem to find where I fit in the world. Considering disability...;;;I'll admit, I don't like reading posts like this. Here I am writing one though.  I want to give up. I've failed at every job I've ever had. I'm a federal employee under FERS. It's the longest time I've ever had one job because it's hard to fire me. I wanted to quit after 6 months, but 6 years later I'm still here. I've had step (2-3% raises) increases taken away for poor performance. Currently, I have something like 800 hours on a 400 hr assignment...with no end in sight.    It is all on me. I come in and can't make myself work.  Pomodoro, stimulants, anti-depressants, and TMS have not helped. I've burned bridges with supervisors I consider friends because I just can't produce. I want to quit and find something else, but I have no references now and I don't like the career field (accounting/audit). If I did find something else, I would find myself in the same place 6 months to a year later.  Too bored to make myself work and feeling like a caged animal in my cubicle.  I'd go back to school and study something that interests me, but I have kids to support.  I consider suicide sometimes. With FERS, my kids would get $500 a head until age 22 and a big ass lump sum that my wife could use to buy a house and get an education with.  I can't handle the chaos at home.  3 kids and an emotionally abusive wife are more than I can handle. I need quiet to get my bearings, so I stay up late....and then I get tired...and then the downward spiral begins. I will clarify though. Even though my wife is verbally abusive, I don't let it get to me. I call her out on it and then proceed like a honeybadger and try to have a good day anyway. It is just exhausting to deal with sometimes and she is trying to be a better person than her mother was to her dad.   I have no real friends. It's hard for me to not dominate conversations and wear people out, even though I am the comedic relief in the office at times. I left Mormonism over historical issues and became a pariah. My family thinks that my problems are evidence that their stupid ass religion is god's one truth on earth and not a fraud. My wife sides with them. I tried to talk to them about the disturbing things I found out about, but they just passed it all off as lies and then blamed me for being weak etc. So I'm the one that is broken and they are all morally superior to me even though they chose to blow me off when I had honest questions.    I can't do the things I like to do anymore. I blew out a couple discs in my back and gained weight. I have recurring joint pain.   As if all of that wasn't enough, we have financial problems. My Mormon wife thinks she can be a stay at home mom even though we can't afford it and that it will "all work out." Our rent increased 300% over 6 years. I had to default on credit cards to get them to settle.  Since I defaulted on the cards, the federal gov revoked my ability to hold a position of public trust. (Financial job).  So my job is probably going to be gone in a few months when my appeal is likely denied.  SO...I feel like I only have two or three options. Try to get a psychiatrist to sign my disability retirement form (not Social Security) and use that small income to find cheap housing near a college so my wife can get a degree, find a really creative way to cause my accidental demise, or just divorce my wife and send her to live off of her parents so I can be a perpetual college student living in a van down by the river.  My psychiatrist is really biased and thinks I should work because other people have worse ADHD than I do...and by worse I mean they have criminal records and low IQ's. At what point is it a disability? All having a high IQ did for me is delay diagnosis until all the bad behaviors were solidified. I think he's wrong.  TL;DR My life sucks and I think I should just try to get disability.  Edit: currently on vyvanse, cymbalta, and naproxen. Diagnosed as adhd-pi with comorbid major depressive disorder. More like I get distracted, accomplish nothing, and then feel like whale shit on the bottom of the ocean for it. :D. They haven't added that to the dsm yet...but pretty much how it works for me.  Edit 2: Thanks for the support.  You all kick ass.  I got some good sleep and have gotten a little bit above my funk that I was in.  Still haven't accomplished anything at work for the past 4 weeks though...
2b0c4a017ccda287a1683055973572a582b22c9c856aeb5ba0e893a62117c5fd;;;I was diagnosed with ADHD just a few years ago (I'm 23 years old) and it has forever changed my perception of things in life, but at the same time, it has crippled me.;;;I currently hold an "OK" desk job but I feel that I'm slowly losing my mind, and physically losing hairs due to stress induced bursts of frustration and its hitting me hard in areas where I question if my sanity will remain stable. I have always dreamed of becoming self fulfilled, hard working and creative at my profession, but I am currently experiencing anything but that.  I do not hold any major degrees, but a simple Plumbing Heating &amp; Cooling degree from a vocational school. I dreamt of becoming a successful plumber, but as soon as I was exposed to the field and the implications that I would face in my daily life out there, I lost interest quickly and gave up the career indefinitely.  School was terrible for me. I have more nightmares about school than I could ever have if I came back from a high activity combat zone in Afghanistan. I could never focus on anything, unless of course, I was really into it. Science, History and English were my favorite parts of my High school education, yet I still performed TERRIBLY in tests that I still remained mediocre at my scores, and thus lost the incentive to seek higher education upon graduation (nor could I afford it).  I traveled to the US when I was at the age of ten. My mother married overseas and now here I am. Before being diagnosed with ADHD, I always believed that my struggle to maintain focus and understanding written problems and tasks were due to my origins off country and the adaptation to a new language, but not due to the way I thought. My low tests scores, grades and lack of focus in class caused many arguments, fights, rebellions, addictions and acts of aggression that I do my best to shut out every day of my life.  ADHD has destroyed me, but at the same time strengthened me yet at the same time... it has crippled me. I've started to develop sociopath behaviors and thoughts that have me questioning my sanity every waking moment of my life. EVERY DAY is something, a battle, struggle, pursuit of knowledge, sex, money IT'S NEVER ENDING!   I could blame all of my faults in society, media and people in general, but I know its my fault. Many with the same condition can become self fulfilled, happy and establish a sense of purpose, but me? I have temporary ideas, bursts of creativity but they HOLD NO VALUE. I really just wish to be successful and happy, but feel pressured by my own goals and expectations.  Dealing with people is too easy. I can manipulate, entertain, please and even inspire others but I absolutely lack in those areas when I see myself in the mirror. And no, I do not have a lack of confidence, but I am quite analytical about my strengths and weaknesses.   What my dream has been for ages is to be a self fulfilled entrepreneur. Someone who is constantly travelling, meeting new people, exploring different environments and worlds, earning multiple figures and enjoying what I do, but I cannot even begin to act upon it. "Go to college, you are incredibly smart!" People always tell me. And I say the same thing every time, "I would gladly go to college if I didn't have to spend the remainder of my adult life managing debt that I cannot afford!". On top of that, just my lack in understanding math in general would destroy my overall GPA. I've tried tutorials, visual classes, audio tapes and books... nothing. Nothing works. I do not retain anything when it comes to math. And don't even ask me about word problems, as I would spend ten times the average amount a human being could possible invest into a three sentence one.  Understanding ADHD however, has helped me greatly. Every thought, action and reaction I experience daily I can quickly analyse and relate the cause and effect. It has been amazing, especially when reading people and interacting in a social environment.  I wish there was a way (clear set instructions) to obtain my goal, but don't we all? Or some way to achieve success, even is its a small fraction of the big picture forever entrapped within my thoughts.  Thank you for your time, I know it's just useless banter, but this was the only place I found worthy to express my experience with ADHD and how it has affected my life.   PS: *After reading the red text at least twenty times over, I was seriously discouraged to share my experience.*  TL;DR: After discovering I had ADHD, my daily life and expectations of the future have become hopeless and pedantic. I wish there was a way to improve in the things I lack and still maintain focus, while being successful and having established a sense of purpose in life.

Last night I think to myself 'don't forget to gas up before going to work, you're going to be too tired to do it on your way back and it's nearly empty'.  Go to work today.  I get there and remember I need to gas up.  Try to find wallet, I forgot it.  Manage to find 3.50$ cash in coins.  Find my debit after 10 minutes of awkward looking around my car for more cash.  Go work.  Come back, only to find that I've no idea where I put my debit card.  Freak out thinking I don't have enough money.  Spend another 10 minutes trying to scrap extra cash.  Then decide to call home from my cell for a possible baillout - just in case I run out of gas -  only to find that I forgot to add more money on my pay as you go account.  Then I think 'oh well let's go to the bank' to get a new bank card to get some cash to gas up.  I get there it's closed.  Managed to sweet talk myself into getting an employee to get another card for me anyhow - while waiting outside because it's closed.  Get cash.  Gassed up.  Got home - speeding obviously.  Lovely day.  Day before, after work I got to my car only to realize I left my key in my coat that I left in the building.  FUN stuff.  It's funny because the field I work in is fast paced as heck and I'll thrive but shit like this happens to me everyday...  Lol been thinking of being diagnosed for years but never quite got past the procrastination of going for an appointment.

I am simply seeing many, many things that point to ADHD (the professionals agree with me) and want to make sure that her habits, such as fidgeting and daydreaming are seen and appropriately handled, both by me and by her school.   At this point, I don't care about a firm diagnosis. However, I'm wondering if I should make sure I get one soon or if it will matter. The professionals have repeatedly said "It's not too early to diagnose her."   We are currently out of the states. Once we get back in about a year, it will be registering her for school, finding docs, etc, etc.   Would it be beneficial or harmful in either way? Thoughts?
5f33c2929733fc4d61445cd37760f86927be2b0c235d1ccd2a63c9ea66065281;;;med rotating?;;;I've done a bunch of searching but couldn't find anything like this in the archives.  I was diagnosed with ADHD just over a year ago, and in that time I've tried 4 different meds: 1. Concerta - worked great, but after titrating up to a higher dose, kept me from sleeping and gave me gastric upset; 2. Ritalin - worked great at first, but after 3-4 months, stopped working; 3. Vyvanse - worked ok, but not like I hoped it would; and finally 4. Currently on a mix of Vyvanse and Wellbutrin.  I *thought* it worked great, but my starting it coincided with a period of extreme busy-ness and forced physical activity (packing for a move + moving + unpacking, all solo due to hubby being away for school), and now that I don't have the forced activity, my symptoms have come back quite a bit and I'm frustrated again.  I keep trying to increase my physical activity level, but when it comes right down to it, I really dislike most of it and want to spend my spare time doing the hobbies I love that I missed while I was doing the move, so I'm caught in this catch-22.  I'm bad for keeping old meds around if I haven't finished them, and on Wednesday I had this hunch that if I was to try and take one of my old Concerta pills again, it's probably been long enough that a low dose will make a big difference again, so yesterday I tried it.  I took the Wellbutrin still (as well as the other stuff I take - prozac, Vitamin D and my blood pressure meds), but subbed the Concerta (at a 36mg dose) for the Vyvanse.  And lo and behold... FOCUS.  My head felt the clearest it's felt in about 2 months.  So now I have this other theory that I want to propose to my psych next time I see her (in 2 weeks), but I'm also scared that I'm going to get in shit for experimenting on myself etc.  Anyways, the idea would be to be on a regular rotating schedule of medication in 3 month intervals or something, so that my system never gets used to it.  I know that ideally I really should learn to cope with life without needing meds for a boost of energy, but I really think that I need the meds to boost me for at least 4-6 months, maybe a little more, so that I can get into some really good, ingrained habits (and get the exercise thing going steady enough that it's not so super difficult for me like it is now), and no med has ever worked for longer than 2-3 months for me, so I end up backsliding for a while, while I wait for my next psych appointment.    Has anyone else ever used a rotating schedule like this?  Does this sound completely insane to the more experienced people out there?  Any ideas on how to present this to my psych?  Thanks!

Unfortunately it's in the middle of a semester, and I have **not** done well so far.  I had to drop a relatively easy gen. ed. required class because I failed every exam no matter how much I studied, I am doing poorly in a lab course where the average grade is an A, and I'm on the verge of failing organic chemistry.  I'm currently in the process of getting a disability accommodation for my ADHD (I have some already for my Type 1 Diabetes, which I tend not to use because I don't need them for my Diabetes). I'm really hoping when I give letters to my professors they are understanding and may potentially give me extra assignments to bring up my grades. But I'm also nervous my professors will dismiss me completely and only comply with the university mandated accommodations.   I'm wondering what I can expect in terms of accommodations, and if you guys have any experience in a similar situation? Bonus points if any of you have applied to professional or grad schools and how lenient they may be when ADHD affected grades (I'm a first semester junior *still* aiming for Vet school with a gpa lower than 3.0)  TL;DR I was diagnosed with ADHD in the middle of a semester, getting horrible grades and about to register with the disability office, but am also wondering if my professors will be willing to allow me to improve my grades before finals.

I realised that my undiagnosed ADHD has had a huge impact on me and I wasn't even aware of it until now. The problem wasn't that obvious until now but I've always had signs in my life, everything makes sense now.   Although I kind of knew it, I hadn't realised how much it affected my life. I am at university right now and my life is a nightmare at the moment. I made a lot of posts here and the r/BipolarReddit about the problems I face. Well, I realised that my ADHD made me feel incompetent in relation to classmates and that fact, slowly, over the years has had a huge impact on my confidence.   The fact that I don't believe in myself and my power, brings me a lot of anxiety related mainly to my academic life but also in life generally s well. When I'm anxious, or overly anxious, my personality and all these things that make me, me (introspection, thinking, analysing and writing things and thoughts) disappear. Then I start feeling I'm loosing myself and I become depressed. Very depressed. I should mention though that there are sings of bipolar disorder as well, as my whole life has been a "OH MY GOSH EXISTENCE IS A MIRACLE" or a nightmare.  I had underestimated how much anxiety and ADHD affects my life and only realised it recently when my life started getting really bad and I started sinking into severe depression. Right now I'm feeling better, I think I start have interest for life again but my mood is so unpredictable.  I started working with myself really hard cause I can't stand this anymore. I'll go to doctors (again) and try to find a way out. I need help.  I won't mention the bipolar disorder to the psych yet. I first want to see if I really have it. (wait for the manic-hypomanic episode)  TL;DR  I realised that ADHD made me believe subconsciously I'm not capable enough which causes a lot of anxiety which causes quite severe depression. There are sings of bipolar disorder as well, but not sure.

I've never posted here before but I thought you all may be able to answer my question/ease my anxiety.  My son is 5 and has been on 1mg of Intuniv for 2 months. It was an absolute miracle pill for him. I am not even kidding. His doctor said that some point we would probably have to increase dosage to 2mg. We were hopeful that it would be in the distant future. Well, a couple weeks ago, our old friends anger, defiance, aggression, bossiness and bartering showed back up. I called to make a follow up appointment, and instead his doctor said to give him two 1mg tablets and see how that works. If there is an improvement, he will prescribe 2mg tablets.  I don't know why the idea of giving him 2 1mg tablets bugs me more than the idea of 1 2mg tablet. Is it the same thing?? He is on XR, so I am just nervous that it won't have the same affect or will have an adverse affect.  Any advice/thoughts is/are appreciated!!  TL;DR - Is two 1mg tablets of Intuniv XR really the same as one 2mg tablet?

Just a vent really...;;;Sorry in advance for the super long post! (TL;DR at the bottom) I've suspected I might have ADD for a couple of years now really, ever since I came across an article about how it presents differently in girls/women than boys. Did a bunch of reading about it at the time but let myself be talked out of seeking a diagnosis by people in my life... "you just need to be more organised/everybody forgets things/you just need to learn to manage your time" etc etc etc. But recently I've been having increasingly more problems dealing with just every day life and I started reading more and more about ADD and now I'm almost completely certain I have it. Every article I read, every symptom list, everything fits me except maybe one or two symptoms. I read people's accounts of having it and I start crying because suddenly everything in my life, all the troubles I have managing the day to day tasks that seem to come so easily to everyone else, all the things I berate myself for being useless and lazy and a slob and stupid for, suddenly it all fucking makes sense and I feel so relieved that maybe I'm not just a complete failure, maybe there is actually a reason I've always been like this. It mainly seems to be the inattentive type (I'm sorry, I don't know all the terminology) - extreme forgetfulness, difficulty listening and focusing, chronic lateness, disorganisation, scatterbrained, distractability, procrastination, etc. I also have diagnosed OCD and anxiety (plus anxiety-induced IBS), have had depression in the past, plus issues with self-harm and eating issues in my teenage years.  Anyway, I'm currently a student, just started my third year of a fairly demanding course. I also got a part time job in July. It's not the first job I've ever had but it's the first time I've worked while at uni. And I don't know if it's the increased stress or what, but all my symptoms just seem to have worsened significantly recently. And it's causing me major, major issues at work.  My job is in a very small, specialist store and my boss has *extremely* specific ways he wants every single little task done. (He also seems to invent new rules on the spot and gets annoyed that I don’t know them, but that's another issue...) We sell hundreds of products (which I’m expected to know all about because of it being a specialist store) and there are completely different methods we need to use depending on which product it is.  I’m realising more and more that I simply don’t have the focus and attention to detail needed to cope with this, I’m making more and more mistakes and fuck-ups by the day and my bosses are getting annoyed and having a go at me what feels like constantly. And the problem is it’s such a small store that when I’m working it’s actually only me and my two bosses so anything I forget (which is a lot of things), I don't have anyone on my level to ask, I have to ask them, and they get annoyed, or bewildered, that I can’t remember and that I’m needing to ask all this stuff.  Of course my anxiety is now through the roof, every minute I’m there I feel like I’m walking on eggshells waiting for the next thing I’m going to mess up, the next thing my bosses are going to be angry at me for. My forgetfulness/distracted-ness is now at ridiculous levels. I’m forgetting important steps in tasks that I’ve done countless times before. My boss will give me a task to do that’s made up of two steps, and by the time I’ve done the first, I’ve forgotten the second, and sometimes I’ve even forgotten that I’ve forgotten the second. I’ll take a phonecall and realise as soon as the phonecall’s finished that I’ve forgotten the caller’s name. I forget to ask customers things about their purchase, or forget to write it down. I could go on and on but you get the gist. I feel like nothing sticks in my head. And my boss gets *pissed*. I’ll either hear him angrily ranting at the other boss about me, or he’ll have a go right to my face about how I’m making his job difficult and making his organisation look inefficient and how I need to “USE YOUR HEAD!” He gets annoyed at me for not taking initiative and asking too many questions, but he also gets annoyed because I try to take initiative and get things wrong. Today is when it really hit me just *how* badly I’m doing at work. Just today, my shift was only five and a half hours long and he had a go at me six separate times for things I messed up because I forgot details or steps or specifically how he wants things done. He commented on how “You’ve been here how long and you’re still forgetting things like this??” and “laziness has been creeping in to the shop” and all this stuff. The last ‘telling off’ of the day, because a customer called to say they were coming to the shop soon to pick something up and I forgot their name, was so severe I ended up crying (fortunately I’d had to leave the shop to go to the post office for them so I was able to get my crying done in there, ha) and I ended up having to call my boyfriend on the way home to cry on the phone to him for ten minutes and then I was still sobbing for like half an hour when I got home haha.  Don’t get me wrong, I know he’s not in the wrong for being angry. I *am* fucking up. I am making these ridiculous mistakes. Shit, I’d be annoyed at me. But I really really really don’t think I can deal with this anymore. I mean I feel so utterly pathetic and stupid and useless that I can’t even cope with a job in a shop. My stress is through the roof and I’m so anxious and dreading going to work. And tbh, I’m fairly certain they want rid of me too. I know they regret hiring me because they think my uni timetable is too busy and I’m not available on the specific days they want me (in the interview and in my contract, they never mentioned they wanted me on specific days and they explicitly said they were happy to arrange my shifts around my timetable. But one boss, the one who keeps having a go at me, has been angry with me ever since term started because I can’t do the exact days they want because they ‘don’t want me in on the other days’. At the start of term, six weeks ago, when I realised my timetable was busier than I expected and was going to be an issue, I offered to hand in my notice, the other boss said “no you don’t need to do that, we’ll work around it” but the other boss has been super annoyed about it and I’ve heard him ranting to other boss about it and how inconvient it is and shit) and I’m fairly certain they think I’m a shitty employee too which, let’s face it, I am. The only thing stopping me from handing my notice in tomorrow is that Christmas is coming up, of course the store is going to get super busy and it takes about two months to properly train a new employee. If I hand my notice in now, I’m pretty sure they’re going to be super angry because it’s going to cause them major issues over Christmas. They’re super busy from now until about two weeks after Christmas, so my plan was to hand in my notice in the middle of January so I would finish at the end of January, giving them the two weeks after the busy period to find a new employee and all that, but honestly I’m not sure how I’m going to deal with another two months of this.  My boyfriend keeps saying I shouldn’t even be thinking about what’s best for them, that it’s not my concern about if they’ll be able to cope over Christmas and all that, but my issue is I don’t have much of a work history (had two jobs before, one temp job that was only three months long, and one voluntary), and I really really need a decent reference from this place. If they’re so annoyed by me leaving at an inopportune time that they refuse to give me a reference, I feel like I’ll be screwed and not be able to find another job, which I really need for when I return to my hometown after my degree, because I can’t easily move back to my family home because I have multiple fish tanks which there isn’t really room for at home. I would really really hate to give those up because it’s one of my few hobbies and I’m so passionate about it and so attached to my fish, obviously I would give them up if finances required it but I would be devastated. I know that must sound super dumb. So yeah, ideally I need to support myself immediately after uni and that’s going to be pretty difficult if I can’t find another job.  I’m going to the doctor on Monday to hopefully get a referral to a specialist for diagnosis so hopefully I can maybe get some treatment, I’m in the UK though and as the guide says the waiting list for treatment on the NHS is absurd, I almost certainly wouldn’t be able to get treatment in time to maybe become better at this job anyway. I’ll probably end up looking into private treatment but as a student I’m not sure that’s going to be feasible financially.  I don’t know why I’m posting this really. Mostly a vent I guess. Maybe for support. My boyfriend is supportive but he doesn’t seem convinced that I have ADD. And he’s getting a bit annoyed because he feels like I’m not listening to his advice because he says I should just have a go at my boss back and tell him not to talk to me like that, but that’s so far removed from who I am as a person, I’m not confrontational, I’ve not had the confidence to stand up for myself for several years, and what’s to stop my boss just shouting at me even more? I’ve not really mentioned any of this to my parents, I’ve vented a bit about work but not told them about all my issues with the forgetfulness and stuff (even despite not knowing about all that they say I should quit), I’m nervous to bring up the possibility of ADD to them without having an actual diagnosis, especially to my dad. I feel like they’re just going to think of hyperactive little boys who can’t sit still in class and be like “You can’t possibly have ADD, that’s ridiculous”. So I dunno, it’s nice to feel like I can talk about this stuff somewhere.  If anyone does have advice I can use for managing my symptoms in this situation, I would really really appreciate that too. The only thing I can think of right now is carrying a notebook with me all the time at work, writing down everything I’m told, maybe even writing out all the steps of a task before I do it. I’m worried about feeling stupid or them thinking I’m stupid for doing that tho. After all, I’m not just messing up tasks that I know I don’t know how to do, I’m messing up tasks that I’ve already done multiple times and think I know how to do. So I’d have to write down *everything*. And of course that’s not always practical, especially when customers are there, I need to be able to do things quickly. I dunno. Anyway, thank you for reading if anybody’s stuck it out this far, I know if rambling were an Olympic sport I could be a gold medallist...  TL;DR: I suspect I have undiagnosed ADD, increased stress has been making me increasingly forgetful, disorganised, and distracted at work to the point my boss is having a go at me multiple times a shift. I feel like a useless sack of shit, my anxiety is through the roof, which is probably in turn making my ADD symptoms worse, and so the cycle goes. Going to the doctor for a referral on Monday but probably can't get a diagnosis/treatment for several months. Want to hand my notice in now but feel like it’s too close to Xmas and I’m worried about screwing my employers over. Practically I probably can’t quit until the end of January. Any advice for coping until then?
5564e9746f2b4db7701d6c13034f96357851fac43343b091cd0dd7a56b9c60ca;;;So I have a far above average intelligence but on a severity scale my ADHD is about as worse as it can be and I feel like wasted potential. I fucked up my GPA to the point I feel as if I will never know what to do. Oh and I dropped out on my 12th year which was my 2nd year in grade 11....;;;Seriously; my ADHD is so bad that the last psychiatrist holding a phd that I consulted seemed surprised at the level of inattentiveness present and this was on a good day 3 hours after taking my daily 60mg of Lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse) so my symptoms were better than when I'm not medicated. She told me when we were reviewing my psych evaluation that "You are far above the average man in terms of intelligence but your inattentiveness associated with your ADHD is by far one of the worst I have seen in my career" and she also said "without ADHD you would top the charts on an IQ test although because on the psych evaluation the attentiveness results are so low despite everything else indicating a high intelligence I don't believe an IQ test can accurately rate your intelligence due to the discrepancies in attentiveness". Seriously for fucks sake; I'm depressed off my ass because I feel like wasted potential (I am actually diagnosed with Major Depression Disorder; Melancholic and cyclical subtype), I have moderate GAD, Social Phobia, and Panic Disorder, Agoraphobia, not as in a fear of crowds but rather a tendency to develop a Panic Attack when in a location where I have previously had a panic attack or when I think about a location I have had a Panic Attack. Well to sum it up I'm not happy with my life and feel like wasted potential but even on days That ADHD chooses not to manifest as bad my crippling anxiety keeps me from getting shit done. What do? Any advice..... I would hate to just get disability an give up on doing something for the world.

Am I the only one? Please tell me I'm not - I know I'll get passed these things in due time but it'd help me feel less alien to know someone else can relate :)
6bcdeebb0e3ce48a892b63de7e4153d4b9f9fdd7ca046ffbc815c0b85dd2b70c;;;In answer to the "But everybody feels like that -" dismissal of ADHD; let's settle this.;;;It seems as though if you aren't walking around thinking you're Napoleon or hearing voices or hallucinating or or or you are considered a *lazy* person who is unwilling to do anything about the issues everyone deals with. In other words everything is reduced to **willpower** and your evident lack of it.  Since I'm nearly 40 (newly diagnosed) and I can see behind me the waste and damage has left and caused mainly through unrealised potential and feeling like sh*t half the time for not being able to do living as efficiently as those around me I rarely disclose my diagnosis on account of the fact that I don't want to hear how it's all in my head (lol, I know right? They say that to mean you could fix it but it's literal meaning is *exactly my issue*: the problem is in my head).  So. To the "Yes, but everyone-" lines I have this:  **The difference you idiots isn't *qualitative*, it's *quantitative*. We (as well as the depressed, as well as the anxious, as well as alcoholics and morbid overeaters) don't feel like that way *sometimes*, we feel that way *always*. We spend our lives swimming against a current of where our brains try to take us because we want and need to go in the other direction.**  Your feeling that way is relegated to *sometimes* in the same way my **not** feeling like that is. I function well (and hence know the difference with how I function normally and can say it's problematic) in *random*, *unpredictable* moments that constitute and *exception to the rule*.   And the rule is: - I have to convince my self to go to sleep at a reasonable hour and then struggle till 3-4am to fall asleep, every night; - I set three or four alarms, usually scattered around the house, in order to wake up, and sometimes I still fail to manage to wake up in time. Every morning; - I saw people far more stupid than me graduate while I dropped out;  - When I consciously try to focus my mind just loses it and goes bananas (and won't let me). Every time; - When I have to make a choice, any kind of choice, all options seem equivalent mostly and again, my mind loses it, every time; - If I need to buy a white shirt and the sales lady tells me they don't have white shirts this season I don't still think I need a shirt anyway and buy another color because just doing that, going in to buy a white shirt was an enormous struggle for. Every time; - I cannot, **cannot ever** relax. Ever; - I have been constantly told I don't really want the thing I do want because if I did want them I would have done something about them.  Talk about adding insult to injury.  As I said, I am nearly 40. I can show you why ADHD exists with all the things that have happened because of it.
3f8b171a53c1ca5da27eeae4514d265b76235b30bfc92d4cc2a6796e72263026;;;ADHD and cyclothymia?;;;Hey, this is something that made me think about... my mood a lot. Lately, my mood has been more, uh, like a rollercoaster than usual. It's pretty much always up and down, every single day is different and some weeks I feel so fucking great, and some weeks I'm an absolute mess and I can't even get out of bed in the morning, so this is giving me a lot of trouble in school. Obviously.  I was diagnosed with ADHD in June and now I take Ritalin and I feel so much better, my appetite is pretty bad and I'm still not used to being "normal" or "relaxed", whatever you wanna call it, so I feel tired a lot.    For as long as I can remember I get mood swings a lot, my mood can go from feeling so fucking great to wanting to smash everything I can grab in seconds. I've smashed up a bunch of things because of this and I can't really control it either because I "black-out" and after that I can't really do anything.   But my mood also changes every single day, well, more or less. At least 2 times a week. It's really weird though, because one day I can feel like I'm unstoppable and my low self-esteem just magically disappears. It's not like I can't control it though. It lasts for a couple of days, and after that it feels like some kind of crash. I always get really, really sad. When I get sad I don't really get sad or whatever, I feel angry constantly. That's how I express those emotions I guess. But I feel like complete shit those particular days, and then my mood either goes back to "normal" or to feeling amazing again. But for the past few months it's been more... Intense than what is used to feel like, and nothing has been fucking with my mood lately so I'm not sure what's causing this.   So, I tried to find some info onn this and I found that a lot of people with ADHD also has some kind of bipolar disorder, and that really made me think because my mom is was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (first type 2, now type 1) 6 years ago and before that, borderline personality disorder.  From what I can understand, cyclothymia is the "milder" version, and instead of weeks, we're talking about days. Also, hypomania instead of "regular" mania, or whatever. But I'm honestly afraid to bring this up because mom got REALLY happy when she found out that I only have ADHD and nothing more serious.    I asked her if she knew what could've caused my extreme mood swings but she just said it's something that happens when you have ADHD, but I'm not sure. I also don't know if I should bring this up to my doctor yet, since this is somewhat new.    I don't even know what I'm trying to say hahaha   TL;DR: Worth checking if I have cyclothymia because of the somewhat recent extreme mood swings I've been experiencing? Talking 6-7 months, more intense than before. My mother has bipolar disorder type 1 so it runs in the family, which is why I'm asking.

I've tried adderall, concerta, and now strattera. Thinking about asking my dr to try vyvanse because I've heard those who didn't have any luck in adderall had some luck with it but what if I never find a medication that works? Does that mean my diagnosis is incorrect? I guess I'm just frustrated that after a year of trying different meds at different doses I'm no better off than when I started.   Thanks for listening to my rant guys, I really do appreciate it.

Finally, two years later or so, I was prescribed Adderall XE and began taking it this week. I wanted to share with you all some of the differences I have noticed in case there are those still on the fence or wondering how much of a difference it makes.  &amp;nbsp;  * I'm **calmer**. No fidgeting, or bouncing my leg constantly.  * Mind is **quieter**. All the distractions and stray thoughts in my head are still there, but they are much easier to ignore. * **Zoning in** instead of **zoning out**. When I am working on something, I don't notice how much time has passed or what is going on around me. * **Organized** thoughts. I have been able to write things on Facebook and reddit that are more organized and I can say more, faster. * **Present** in conversations. When someone is talking to me, I am really listening to what they say and can hear more since I'm not trying to focus. * Decreased **appetite**. For better or worse, I have been eating about half what I usually do. I almost have to remind myself to eat during the day.  &amp;nbsp;  I know this is only the first week, and things could still change, but so far I'm really excited about the potential for this to work.  TL;DR - Adderal is having many positive effects and is so far being a big help.

Thoughts?;;;Yesterday I told my GP the Adderall XR was going okay side-effect-wise, but I still haven't seen many differences.  He wondered (again) if he made the wrong diagnosis. He said that if I do have adhd, I should *immediately* be seeing benefits with *any* medication. We've only tried Concerta and Adderall XR, which have ranged from no effect to feeling pretty bad. He said this after the Concerta, too.  He renewed the Adderall xr anyway and referred me to a psychiatrist, but the waitlist could take several months. I'd be happy to see a specialist, but if the wait is that long I'm probably going to have huge problems with next semester and my externship.  My school case manager who, to be fair, isn't a doctor, said it can take several tries to find one that works, and anxiety could be covering any benefits it might have. I told him I worried a lot about whether I actually had it or if it was just my own doing. He said a lot of the time that's caused by negative self talk, and while it's true there's no "objective" signs someone has it, doctors have different opinions on it too.  Really I just feel frustrated and awful. No matter how hard I push myself I can't keep any routines or get anything done and I am trying my absolute hardest to pay attention to people speaking, but I can't. I'm not even aware of when I've lost my focus. I keep going back and forth between "it's just my own fault, I'm lazy" and feeling like something is really wrong with how my brain works.  **tl;dr** Tried 2 different meds with little to no effect, doc says if I really do have ADHD I should have had an immediate benefit. Seems okay with keeping me on Adderall xr but is hesitant to try others despite Adderall xr not doing much. Anyone experience this and what should I do?

When I was little (probably from the ages 3-5) I would have huge meltdowns where I would just break down. I would cry, kick and scream when the littlest thing went wrong. I don't really remember them but from the stories they sound awful and would last a really long time and there was no clear reason as to why they would happen. It is very strange because I was very quiet and a "pleasure to have in class" in school. I'm just recently diagnosed ADHD (about a year ago) and now I'm wondering if those meltdowns were because of it. Maybe not being able to deal with frustration? Did Anyone else experience something similar in their childhood?

Need help;;;Okay, i'm going to make this as short as i can.  * I've taken Vyvanse for around a year and i started to notice a tolerance buildup.   * So i told my doctor and he had me start the slow process of upping the meds (10mg for a week, 20mg for a week, etc etc) on Focalin XR.   * I was taking 50mg of Vyvanse for the year, so I obviously went through a bit of physical withdrawl. I mentioned that to my doctor and he said there is no withdrawl.. I know thats not true or else i wouldn't of felt so down and lazy.   * ANYWAY, as of today, i'm on 40MG Focalin. But the thing is, i feel even more distracted by random things than i was more than a year ago without any meds.. I'll start one thing, see something else, and just start doing that instead.   * One of the perks of that, is that whatever i do, its productive. If i'm doing homework and see something laying on the floor, i go and pick it up, once i do that, i start organizing stuff until i realize that i was suppose to be doing homework. Its frustrating honestly.   *So if anyone has any ideas of any other meds that would help, please tell me!  ----------------What i've had so far (in detail):----------------------  1.  Vyvanse 50mg for about a year  2.  Recently started taking Dexmethylphenidate (Focalin XR) 40mg. Been doing so for almost a month.

Tried 15mg, it was great for studying/cramming/doing essays, then 20mg worked even better and longer for a year or so. Couldn't try IR since Canada doesn't have them apparently, tried crushing up the xr beads into powder but they only worked once in a while. It gave me insomnia for the first year no matter how early I took it, always had to be careful with what foods (avoided citrus, juices, waited an hour if I ate before taking it and took a tums with it too)  I ate before lol and whether or not I exercised that day. Oh and I ALWAYS had to take breaks in between, so like 3-4 days of taking it a week or else I built up tolerance so fast. It also made me crave cigarettes so much and also wanting to go out to drink after. Oh and got some blurred vision and like felt like I was "hallucinating stuff" at times ugh and gave me heart palpitations some days.    **Dexedrine 5mg Tabs - Oct 2014-Jan 2014 on and off**: 2014 Sucked I thought I got a bad batch or something,but eventually had to take like 5 pills+ to feel remotely close to the focus/concentration I had with adderall xr 15mg/20mg at the time but it lasted for like an hour lmao. Great focus/concentration but felt paranoid after it wore off.   **Dexedrine 15mg Spansules - Nov 2014-Jan 2014 on and off**: 2014 Worked excellent, felt the calmness/focus but after a week I had to add in one dexedrine 5mg  to make it work for 3-4 hours. Great focus/concentration but felt paranoid after it wore off, gave me heart palpitations.    **Vyvanse - Feb 2015 - Dec 2015**: Got 40mg, the only adhd drug that I got the least anxiety before, during and after taking the pill and didn't feel like I was "on something". BEST part is that it doesn't matter what the fuck, or when the fuck I eat stuff haha, and it comedowns were for the most part smooth, though some days still got imsonia. Although 40mg doesn't work as well as 60mg anymore which is annoying since I was only on 40mg for 3-4 months. I quit smoking because of this and eventually even drinking I've stopped having urges to go out. Never got hallucinations or blurry vision during the comedowns either. Also I seem to be able to talk to people with less self-consciousness, but at the same time I feel calmer on it so I don't OVERshare that much like on adderall xr, helped with my impulsiveness. However there are still days where 60mg feels like it isn't as long lasting if I don't have much planned to do you know?   **TL;DR**: Argh, but yeah long story short, finally got diagnosed but the doctor put me on 5mg adderall xr (I've taken all of the above bolded above for studying from friends' on campus) and she told me try it for 2-4 doses once a day for two weeks, seeing her again on Monday to tell her it works well. However two days it was ok, then it sucks cause it barely lasts and it feels like a "tease" where the first 1-2 hours is amazing, and I get the blurry vision, mild hallucinations and anxiousness to talk to people or be outside walking alone, etc. after the 1-2hours, then it dies down and I can't focus and feel mildly depressed/anxious/irritated. WAS SO ANNOYED cause I had two papers due that week, so I just took 30mg xr to try, still barely worked lmao so I just went back to my leftover supply of vyvanse 60mg and it helped immensely again to focus and complete my papers thank god. This is probably because I've tried a ton of stuff before and actually "been on" adderall xr for almost two years on and off along with the other various shit I've gotten. Really don't want to tell her my side effects and she won't try vyvanse then.. argh. ANYWAYS does this sound like your guys' experiences? LOL
cdf57e7b4588f947367d4425b67044058d85b14369f9e76ab03a36b9569d9b52;;;I've hit a dose of adderall that is actually working - but I'm focusing on all the wrong things?;;;Hi friends,  I've been taking Adderall XR for over a year and I'm still titrating up. I spent a long time at each dosage level because I was never really sure if there was a difference. I figured since I have so few responsibilities in my life right now, it was just hard for me to see the difference if there was one.  Then a week or so ago I went up to 25mg. For the first time I'm confident that there is a difference but I'm not sure it's good. I've been hyperfocusing more than usual, and with more extreme consequences. This week I:  * didn't eat anything before 5 PM most days (loss of appetite from the medication played a role here, but it's also that I knew I had to eat and didn't because I was so absorbed in whatever I was doing on the Internet) * showed up an hour late for a volunteer shift (new low, way lower than my previous new low), because I couldn't make myself stop what I was doing and leave on time * was given an urgent task to do at work, went back to what I was doing and immediately forgot about the urgent thing - did I mention it was urgent?? * missed my stop on the bus and didn't realize it for 15 minutes, which put me 20-30 minutes behind schedule for going to *BABYSIT*. The rest of the bus ride I kept thinking "how do people think I'm responsible enough to look after their children!?" and that sort of thing. I hate feeling like that. That was the last straw for me. I'm normally very anxious about missing my stop so this was completely out of character and it convinced me that all these things listed couldn't have been coincidental.  Every time I see my psychiatrist she asks what *I* think we should do (increase the dose, stay at the same one for another month, maybe try a different medication entirely). I have a feeling she'll do that this time, which is why I'm posting here in advance to be more prepared. Sometimes I wish she was more authoritative.  **I guess I'm looking for advice from people who have been in a similar situation. If you felt like Adderall was working, but you weren't getting "positive" results - did you need to adjust your habits to compensate (if so, in what ways and how did you get yourself to actually stick to the new routine)? Should I try a higher dose? How exactly did you decide when you were at the *right* dose? Thanks!!**  PS sorry for posting twice in two days - didn't see a rule about this and my last one was a discussion not a self-post, so I figured this was fine? Having a particularly eventful week ADHD-wise.

The reason I'm posting this is because I want to know if anyone has gotten this before and what they have done and also what you think of stimulants for treating ADHD, I think they hand out prescriptions to easy and that stimulants are a bad road to head down  Edit 16/12/2016: I talked to my psychiatrist yesterday and he increased the dose to 50mg which I took this morning and it seems to be working again!

46fc98ad794dc9c467019875aedd8149cfdfde81531ae2483bb0a8d67ddb8300;;;ADD or simply not studying/doing the right thing - where to draw the line?;;;I'm in my 4th year of college right now, but I'm about to quit in order to go to flight school and (hopefeully) become a commercial airline pilot. Looking back at those frustrating 4 years of barely passing any exams, with extreme periods of procrastination and an inability of sitting down and learning or listening to theoretical stuff without losing track of my thoughts and some minor details catching my attention, carrying my thoughts away.  I was suffering from depression, because I just couldn't get anything done and I was lacking any experience of success. ADD was considered, I got Ritalin prescribed, but it didn't help, despite trying all kinds of doses.  It was this summer when I figured that I might just be doing the wrong thing. I haven't been super excited about studying in first place, it was just the more obvious alternative to flight school, and since all my friends were about to go to college, I did so as well.  So now I'm about to drop out of college, and I don't mind, but looking back at those years I am wondering whether I am just not the type of person made for studying (since it seems like not everyone is made for studying, otherwise everyone would do it, right?) or whether there was/is some ADD condition going on in my head.  I think it's very hard to draw the line here, between personality traits and an actual ADD condition. The thing is, I definitely **can** focus if I am really motivated to do so and if I'm really interested in something. I've passed the first qualification exams for flight school, measuring my reaction time and my attention span, and the results were above average, so I think this speaks for itself. I am really happy about that, and it was important to me to share my thoughts here.  Still, I think it is definitely something to consider when people start diagnosing themselves with AD(H)D. Maybe some of them are just doing the wrong thing, I don't know...  **TL;DR:** Quitting college becaue my performance was miserable. Now about to go flight school with a good outlook. Therefore wondering whether severe focussing issues can be caused by a lack of interest  and/or certain personality traits as well (in some cases) and are misdiagnosed as ADD.

Strattera didn't help much. Then i was prescribed Methylphenidate. It was really effective but i felt a lot of emotional blunting(feeling less emotions, like a zombie, always engaged in my work) and a lot of sadness.  Dr Barkley says that ADHD is the most treatable disorder in psychiatry. But how are people able to tolerate such effects of such medications? I honestly can't do without medications but the thought of not being able to feel emotions and feeling low all the time doesn't help either.

I felt as though I had completely figured out how to cope with this disorder up until a few months ago but I now realize it was because I was touring in a band full time and living a "rock star" life style. At that point my brain had no other choice but to reward me with some dopamine here and there. Long story short, life has slowed down a little for me and my ADHD has come back to haunt me HARD.  I'm going back to school for Graphic Design in the end of January and I think I need to try medication again. I can't even hold a normal conversation with my girlfriend who I love very much so the thought of going back to school is making me think more and more that medication might be a good idea.  I've heard some horror stories about what ADHD medication can do to your creativity so I was wondering if anyone had any stories of ADHD meds helping or hurting your creativity because at this point in my life it's all i feel I really have a hold on.
63e9535ed32c7ee228d5f81a2132cd1b5e2d12c9cc60d1257c63ba902e94299c;;;How to get back in touch with an old friend, whom I lost partially due to ADHD?;;;I have a longer novel written out [in the relationships sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3wo1mj/me_27f_with_my_old_friend_27m_havent_talked_to/), but I believe you guys may be able to give me your perspective on this too.  The short version of it is: I moved out to a different country 4 years ago and lost touch with all my friends. I was completely overwhelmed by all the new responsibilities and obligations (switching from parents saying "just study, don't do any chores" to "study for Masters degree, learn new language, household chores, make money, pay bills, live with new boyfriend, etc.)  One friend is in the same different country as me, and 4 years ago wanted to meet up, but I kept postponing due to poor management on my part. I didn't even realise how much I was doing that. Eventually he stopped asking, and I was too ashamed and afraid to talk to him.  Fast forward to now: I have recently been diagnosed with ADHD and social anxiety. I am managing it a bit better, and I am lonely as hell. I want to apologise to my friend, and maybe keep in touch better (meet up, etc.). I consider ADHD to be an explanation, not an excuse, and I really want to do better.  So I want to send a message and invite him over for dinner.  How would you guys go about this? Our country of origin doesn't know much about mental health issues, so I am afraid to mention it because it will likely scare him off, or at least make him uncomfortable. What should I say? How do I apologise? Should I wait until my life is even more stable due to meds and new coping mechanisms?
f18d1eafdffad7363ba86115a25bdc6d1c67422f4fa9bc122384d3e495dc7177;;;I have this strange feeling or craving and I dont know what it is, or if it associated with my ADHD;;;Hello folks, short time lurker, little experienced poster.  I have ADHD [22M], and take medication for it. Sometimes when I'm sitting down and trying to do work, I have this sudden urge to satisfy some sort of need or craving to do something. Its rather hard to explain, but to put it simply, it like being horny, or hungry - but none of those things feel like the right answer. Its not violent, and never really makes me frustrated. I'm not sure if this has anything to do with my ADHD, but I feel like it does somehow. Sometimes its intense, and i have to get up and take a walk or something to take my mind off of it, but sometimes its mild and I can easily push it away. Does anyone else experience this? What is it? If so, what have you found that works for you?  TL;DR I have weird cravings to do something and nothing satisfies. I might be a serial killer or maybe Im just hungry.  Edit: I think its a weird urge to do ANYTHING else. It usually happens when im trying to study or do some other boring mundane task. It feels more like a gut craving than a mental disinterest, how do I deal with this?
3c493f5686daf1354e45d4083648ef69c44648f1e51b00085236d00ff3259fb9;;;Is ADD/ADHD in adults not taken seriously by doctors?;;;Hello  For a very long time, I have suspected I have ADD. My brother AND my sister were diagnosed as children with ADHD. They exhibited many of the hyperactivity symptoms. But me, I was not "hyper" so I believe that I was overlooked although I have many of the symptoms of ADD.   A few years ago, I went to either a psychologist or psychiatrist in a different state that I live in ( used to live in Louisiana, now in Georgia). He basically dismissed my concerns and said if i wasn't diagnosed as a child, I wont be diagnosed as an adult. That rejection has caused me to feel pretty hopeless in getting help for something I am pretty convinced I have.   Is it commonly a struggle to have a doctor take your concerns seriously? Now that I am in a new state, I want to try to go to a doctor again, but I thought I would ask how have others who were diagnosed as adults what they did to have their doctors to agree that there is such thing as ADD/ADHD and help get the diagnosis?

I do not have depression. I bombed my finals, but still got good marks in the classes.   (This is my first post on reddit ever! :P)  I'm in the middle of getting diagnosed for ADHD through my college.  I've already been diagnosed with anxiety and depression, but I "personally" thought that I had ADHD too.   I mentioned that to my therapist. I'm nervous that I don't have ADHD and my therapist keeps kind of hinting that she doesn't think that I have it, which is making me doubt myself.  I'm not 100% sure why I made this post, but I'm feeling down right now. I have two finals tomorrow and have been trying to make myself study, but I can't. I don't know what to do. Normally, my anxiety will kick in and make me study, but lately (since I've started therapy) my anxiety has lessened.  Normally, this is a good thing, but I feel like I NEED my anxiety to function. I start to do stupid things (forget stuff, procrastinate) when I'm not feeling anxious.  I think that my anxiety and depression stem from possible ADHD (inattentive type). If I don't have it, then I'll be confused on what's wrong with me... Anxiety and depression feel like the result of a problem. Not necessarily the root of my problems.  TL;DR: I think that my anxiety and depression stem from ADHD. Worried that if I don't have it, then I won't know wtf is wrong with me. Been having trouble studying lately, since my anxiety has lessened.
c73cb78427453334818b3d2251fc894aaf1393c8e4667ee3e0dd96944dde529b;;;Problems with procrastinating;;;Hey guys, what's up?  Obviously I'm here to ask about procrastinating.  I'm a high school senior (almost done ;~; ), and I struggle immensely with procrastination.  It seems like even when i know i'm facing a shit-load of homework, i can't stop myself from browsing stupid youtube vidyas and watching those for hours.  Today I spent maybe three hours total watching videos, and two hours studying.  I could've spent significantly more time studying, but b/c of my procrastination I didn't.  I think it may affect my grades, but I'm not too sure.  Physics and Calc are just really difficult classes which I think explain my lower grades in those two subjects, but even so, i think procrastination plays into it.  Do you think ADHD is accentuating my procrastination problems?  Do any of you suffer greatly from it, too?  And lastly, how can I cope with it?  TL;DR I procrastinate a lot, how do I stop or cope?
a9244aec5d3a25132337629dafd4fc2ee6ac2338bf0005ddf80adf38c27d3294;;;Have you ever had to tel your employer? I might have to, because they seem to think I am on drugs . . .;;;So I just started a new office job. Scheduling jobs and sending out bids. Pretty good job at a major telecom company.   I've been there for a month and they sat me down the other day to discuss :  1) late / time issues  2) I took 3 days sick (I know bad, only been there 1 months, but i hadn't slept at all and didn't feel safe driving on the icy roads on the highway with my brain being that impaired)  3) they have seen me and I quote "wandering around"  4) My manager casually mentioned if I had any physical or mental health problems, or need rehab for addiction. WTF. That's what got me worried, that they literally think I am on drugs!   I got some anxiety issues as well. So that's not to say I didn't contribute to this perception, but my self awareness really took a hit because I did not think it was nearly this bad.   I told them that I have an underlying condition, they did not as for specifics but I think for the sake of honesty I should tell them on Monday.   I just dont want to be high maintenance or get "special" privilege because I try to do my best without it. But obviously it's noticeable and its better I tell them that rather than have them think I am on drugs.

5fdc5f94624d70d1b07bfba1dcf302de3baa91c3ff43ce3c97be11790a9707f9;;;Newly diagnosed and medicated, having opposite of intended effects;;;So I was diagnosed about three months ago, and started medication right away. I began on the lowest dose of Adderall  XR (15) and each month I've moved up by increments of 5 (now taking 25).   15 was good and I felt improvement, but not at the level I had fantasized that medication would help me at. Maybe that's where I went wrong? I wanted to see if it could be more helpful if I increased my dosage and my doctor supported it.   Now that I'm taking 25, I feel like everything is counterproductive. I feel like all of my symptoms have come back even stronger than when unmedicated. I have never been an emotional person, but where I might have teared up in a movie, I now bawl almost uncontrollably (heaving, runny nose, the whole ridiculous nine yards). If people are talking when I'm trying to focus, I can no longer focus and get really panicked over the distraction. In situations like this when I get panicked and lose focus, or some times when I'm drinking, I now get self-harm urges which has never happened before. I don't mean anything dangerous or even damaging, just little intense urges to hit myself, bite myself, dig my nails into my arms...   I want to get back down to a lower dose when possible, but I just refilled the 25's so Ill have to wait until next month.   My mom is a therapist. She knows about the emotional changes I've experienced (because it's hard to hide regular uncontrollable crying) but I haven't told her about the pain/punishment urges. She is fine with lowering my dosage but wonders if maybe the emotional stuff is actually just a lot of unrelated sadness that I've been holding in for a long time. I could see some truth to this maybe, but I feel like it's the medication making me this way. It's hard to tell what's me and what's the drugs. I don't know what my question is really, anyone have similar experiences? Could it be that the drug is bringing out parts of me that I didn't know were there? Or is it just too high of a dosage that I need to lower?  TL;DR- Just started Adderall for ADD and I think high dosage is causing opposite of intended effects
c993ec88b3b21ad451840f4660a1c3c42299ae03bc871495c2767a69bf03ba8d;;;Don't want to be seen as looking for drugs.;;;Hi everyone,      I was on Stratera as a young child for a period of a year or so; I asked my Mother to take me off of it and haven't had a prescription for ADHD meds since. Since I've been off, throughout middle, high school and now college I struggle with concentration, impulse control, depression, motivation and being able to do a task at all. As a result I've suffered bad grades, debt and going through jobs when I just couldn't stand to be there anymore.   I've trained myself to be more anchored in tasks I need to do, but if I need to do something and it's not of the utmost importance I will not do it, at all.  I went to my doctor recently to get diagnosed for ADHD but instead got prescribed Buspar, an anti anxiety. I understand my doctors hesitation to give out Adderall at all, although from taking my friends or some I've bought I feel as though all my problems are gone, I'm the person I want to be. Of course I will not talk about me doing this with my doctor, I just fear that he thinks I'm just trying to get drugs per my age (21).      I don't know what I was trying to accomplish here by posting this, I just needed to vent.      I plan on making an appointment with a psychiatrist who specializes in adult ADHD. Has anyone around my age been through the same type of experience?
9340523d18c4bbca86c3df74a72d6a3c1f7813fcb66d9ca747213fbfb6146ec0;;;Is my roommate is using ADHA as an excuse?;;;I got this new roommate about 5 and 1/2 months ago and instantly we did not click. He does not do his dishes, wipe down the counters, flush after pooping, take his clothes out of the dryer or washer at times, and practices his music loudy after 10pm, etc. I mean LOUD, you can hear him from across the street loud.  I would remind him every other week to do everything I listed and more, then it became every week, but it he ignores my requests. He would do his tasks for a couple of days then would stop. It infuriates me more than I can describe. About a couple of months in, he tells me he has ADHD and that he can only focuses on 2 or 3 things: music, wrestling, and working out. Everything else is hard for him to remember to do. So I told him to make a list and make sure he gets everything on the list done.   Needless to say, the list did not work. It's a struggle to have him do his dishes or remember to flush the toilet at times. There's always an excuse or a lie.   Fast forward 3 months after we live together and I've had enough and was going to kick him out, but he loses his job so I let him stay until he finds something. He decides to buy a car to make it easier to go to interview. He told me he has 8K in the bank and the car would be 4K so there's 4K left, which should last him 6 months after rent, food, and gas. Turned out he only had about 5K, and now 2 months of unemployment, no money, same excuses of ADHD keeping him from remember to do anything around the house, or finding a job. I'm in a very tough situation. It's the holidays but I can't live with him anymore so I tell him to he has to move out by the end of January.   We get in the same argument every single week about how he forgot to do something or he's being inconsiderate of other people in the house. So I called him lazy for things like not closing the contact case all the way and spilling solution everywhere when he throws it into the drawer, or how he doesn't flush, or take his hair out of the drain, or do the dishes, etc. There's an actual list of 88 things he doesn't do. I was angry enough this time to call him a liar, which he does all the time, like the amount of money he has, when he bought a new phone but said someone else did, or lied about using my shampoo, the list goes on.  The next day he sends me 2 links about ADHD and how what he said are "honest lies" because his brain is lying to him too. Another link about how people with ADHD are misunderstood to be lazy.   https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/liking-the-child-you-love/201002/adhd-and-honest-lies-0  https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/may-i-have-your-attention/201204/are-people-adhd-lazy  I don't believe his ADHD is lying to me, I think he's lying to me and he knows it. He doesn't admit the truth when confronted with it. As for him being lazy, I told him I know its hard for him to stay focus and study or look for a job but not closing the contact case all the way everything day before throwing it in to the drawer is lazy.  So my question is, are his claims legit or is he just a terrible roommate? I have to live with him for another month and a half with no rent and I don't know what else to tell him without him constantly throwing ADHD in my face as his shield. I'm at the point where I might kick him out right before Christmas, which would be terrible. Also he's not hyper at all, most mild person I know.  How do I get him to work with his ADHD and stop using it as an excuse? And what do you think of those articles?   TL:DR - Terrible roommate is using ADHD as an excuse to be a liar and lazy bum. I though ADHD is about concentration/focus or lack there of, but does it ADHD you live a different reality than those around you? and does ADHD make you forget to brush your teeth, and do your dishes?

So since I was diagnosed and started getting a prescription for Vyvanse, my mom has been subtly suggesting that she wants to try one to see what it feels like and to better understand how I feel through out the day. I totally understand this and think it's a reasonable thing to do as a mother. I do however feel that there's another reason she wants to try it: weight loss. She's been trying to lose 10-15 pounds for years and hasn't been able to. She knows the Vyvanse reduces my hunger and I think she wants to try it to see if she can lose a few pounds.   Some background on my mom. In terms of personality she is type A. Very responsible and in control of whatever situation she's in. Always planning ahead months in advance and in charge of the finances (she has to do everything around the house because my dad has undiagnosed ADHD). As far as addiction potential for her I think it's very VERY low. She rarely drinks and has barely experimented with weed when she was younger. Her and my dad used to go out a lot when they were younger in the 70s when hard drug use (cocaine, heroine) was wide spread and she was never drawn to any of it. She 100% prefers to be  completely sober and doesn't even like to drink much.    I'm not too worried but for some reason I still feel weird/slightly nervous about her trying one. They're 20mgs. She's 5'1", 120lbs.  **TLDR: My non-ADHD mom wants to try one of my Vyvanse to understand how I feel during the day. I think she has low addiction potential but I'm still worried. What should I do?**

Throughout my post secondary studies in physics, I have been struggling with sleep issues, and overall lack of focus, which led to doctors suggesting sleep issues, then a depression diagnosis and finally an ADHD diagnosis. Since being treated for ADHD, I feel like a better functioning me and my overall quality of life has improved significantly. However, one problem still remains and that is...  The diagnosis was made 8 years too late.  During the summer of 2015, I pursued an ADHD diagnosis by seeing a new psychiatrist on my own accord with little help of my previous psychiatrist who was fixated on my depression and social anxiety diagnosis. I do not disagree with her nor question her expertise and she made a valid diagnosis, but I felt that it was a result of the lack success in my life. On top of that, I received no help from the central mental health institution of my city (for those who know of it, it was CAMH) whose doctors believed that ADHD is hokum and since I was admitted to university I don't have ADHD. Along with this search, I was also being issued statements from my university that I am required to withdraw. This resulted in increased stress, anger towards life and the outcomes and most importantly, the destruction of my morale. I could also go on ranting about how university's forced withdrawal policies are utter nonsense, since it is not the university who is funding my education but rather myself, and I feel that I should have ultimate control over what I do with my own funds, but I digress.   Where I am at now (Begin here):  I have been diagnosed for a little over 6 months and been out of school for about 9 months and I have no motivation to go back into an environment of learning and discovery, an environment which I loved and was passionate about. I feel that this slump was attributed by the realization that the incline of the mountain of which I must travel upwards is now steeper than ever before. As it turns out, my high school credits have essentially expired and applying as a mature student is out of the question due to the outlandish requirements I must meet, such as:  &gt;Have demonstrated potential for success through academic, professional or volunteer activities and other accomplishments. &gt;Have a favourable academic record  I have no idea how to respond to these requirements. I mean, does working full time at a minimum wage retail job count as a successful attribute? I don't feel that it is. As for academic success requirement, I have no clue what to mention since my academic history has been torn to pieces with each failed attempt I made in the past.  I feel that I have hit rock bottom and that I am a token of the board game of Monopoly who just landed on the "Go To Jail" space of life where I do not pass Go, collect $200 and I am forced to skip three turns. I have been considering going back into my original degree of study (physics) and complete it, but I am anxious of the thought that history will repeat itself. Additionally, the thought of switching degrees and starting anew seems too daunting of a task since I will be essentially start from the bottom and the thought of wasting the past 8 years studying physics and leaving the path that I created for myself causes me to retract from this option. Furthermore, the thought of being 25 years old with little finances and no post secondary degree to show for worries me with each passing day and being forced to withdraw from university feels like life has pressed pause on me even though the cassette of life continues to play through.  **TL;DR** Diagnosed with ADHD late in life and I have lost the motivation to continue my education and I am fearful of the future. I need advice and a direction. Hopefully someone that was in a similar situation can provide insight of how he/she managed to escape this hole of low morale.  **EDIT**  Thanks to all who responded and offered suggestions and advice. I've been meaning to respond individually to each post but I have been busy with work lately. I will reply individually in the next day or two to thank and answer specific questions. In the mean time to answer some general questions:  1) I am a male   2) I am in Canada   3) I am eating healthy, better than before on medication because I'm not binge eating like I used to

Up until this year, the idea I might have ADHD never crossed my mind...  I'm a 26 year old woman in the US.  This year I started graduate school in a very competitive MA/PhD program in the humanities after 3 years away from school (I finished college in 2012).  I've been going to a therapist for probably 5 years and have been on SSRIs for anxiety and depression for probably the same amount of time. I've never felt that they completely worked and with the beginning of my program, I've gone back to a psychiatrist to get the medications adjusted because I'm really floundering.  I'm finding it absolutely impossible to get through my massive reading load.  A 30-40 page article will take me hours to get through because I get so distracted with god-knows-what thoughts.  My readings in foreign languages take even longer because any distraction means I couldn't understand anything I just read.  I can't skim (I've tried) because if I do this, I can't retain any of the information from the article, apart from the biggest, most general ideas. This is a problem for contributing to class discussions because I constantly feel stupid, underprepared, and like I can't get anything right anymore.  Most of the readings are in topics I find uninteresting (the classes this semester were more general studies and I'm interested in a specific subset of my field that my coursework last semester didn't cover). This subject is something that I used to love (for the last decade or so of my life it has almost been my identity) and I'm starting to get really depressed and feel worthless that I can't get this stuff done.  I try hard to schedule my time and ensure I'm studying at my desk, but that does not help productivity.  Often I get restless and have to get up from my desk just to keep my thoughts from getting so overwhelming that I can mildly concentrate.  At first I just thought this was a combination of anxiety and impostor syndrome as well as adjusting tograd school, but a psychologist at my student health center asked if I wanted an ADHD screening as part of my intake.  I said no at the time, having a misunderstanding of what ADHD is, especially inattentive type and especially in adults/women.  I thought that there was no way I had it.  I did very well in school as a kid and in college.  But I started reading about it out of curiosity (you can always get me interested in psych articles) and I was shocked at how many of the symptoms seem to fit me.  In college I had many of the same problems with focusing on reading, but since the load was lighter, I always managed to get through it, even though it took me hours longer than I always felt it should.  Writing has always been crippling -- when I finally focus and get into it, I produce really amazing work, but I struggle with really bad procrastination and this has caused a lot of problems with larger scale writing projects.  In college this caused me to miss a lot of deadlines. I was blessed with understanding professors, who must have realized I was working hard and gave me extensions, so I kept my grades up, but I always sort fo felt like I was "getting by" in college and not living up to my potential like many of my overachiever classmates.  The thought of getting involved with clubs/leadership in school was out of the question: if I did this, there is no way I would have time or mental energy to get through my readings, as they took so long.   After college I got an administrative job at a law firm and quickly struggled.  I've taken pride in being a good employee and in internships with big picture/creative tasks, I always managed to keep myself focused enough to do a good job and get praise.  However in this job, the work was so tedious that I just could not focus and I think my supervisors found me lazy... I would get in trouble for not noticing typos and other executive mistakes, even though I would proofread my work 3+ times.    In other parts of my life, I get really restless when forced to stay in one place for a long time (unlike many of my other introverted friends, I can't deal with "days in", I get bored and depressed), I've always been a big daydreamer, and close friends note that I have a tendency to "zone out" when I'm trying to listen to them.  I've also had a tendency since childhood to interject in conversations with random segues that make sense in my brain (my train of thought got me there somehow), but have no context in the conversation.  I had trouble sitting down and focusing on my homework since childhood, but I think as a "gifted" kid, I was able to overcompensate by getting it right when I finally did it.  I always felt guilty that I wasn't as focused as my peers.    Anyway, I have finally decided to get texted after talking to my former therapist (we were doing a wrap up session at home, since I'm trying to transition to someone permanent at school) and she quietly suggested I get tested, as one of her adult clients recently got diagnosed at age 40.  I swas shocked she suggested it.  When doing the reading I thought I might have it but was worried due to my academic success in the past and was afraid people would accuse me of medication seeking and/or being a hypochondriac.  I'm going to seek a screening when I get back to school, but part of me is terrified they will laugh in my face or results will be inconclusive and I'll be back to square one.  My current medication is not working and managing school/life in general just feels hopeless to me right now. Just wondered if anyone had advice or similar experiences.  TLDR: I'm a 26 year old female PhD student and hitting a wall after all my coping mechanisms/habits have failed me. Wondering if I may have ADHD and looking to see if any folks heare had similar experiences
c08237feaf6bffebfafe3f349e8548955f8cb940c04b233d026c987c4afa4d23;;;Just got prescribed ADHD meds, desperately need advice.;;;I'm currently on Zoloft 50mg for anxiety and depression, and it's not really doing that much. My main psychiatrist suggested to increase Zoloft by 25mg, and after me suggesting i probably have ADHD, she prescribed 150mg Wellbutrin in addition. Have not started it yet.  After discovering the only person in the region who deals with adult ADHD and visiting him, he prescribed me with 36mg Concerta. I thought i'd be glad to find someone who understands the condition, but he turned out to be inexperienced and frankly suspicious. (He prescribed it very easily, and seems to be running a good deal with the local pharmacy store).  I just don't know what to do, and am just tired of juggling the issues with these conditions as i can never seem to directly point to the main culprit. What do i do, take Wellbutrin as my main psychiatrist suggested or give Concerta a shot?

I went to the doctor because I'm aware of my life long struggle with anxiety when it comes to events that are of importance to me, causing me to overthink, become stressed and sometimes fail. I also found it hard to focus. I would read a whole page in a book while thinking about something else and realize I didn't pay attention to anything I read.   The effects so far are working. I've ised Adderall before (Xr and Ir) and felt that hyper focus, ultra euphoric feeling but those were higher doses I think.   I'm here asking what you guys think/know about 10mg a day. My initial plan was to use it only when I needed to focus on doing paperwork or read as I want to become a realtor. It's day 4 in a row though and my doctor wants me to take it everyday so we can see how it works for a couple weeks and we will meet back up and talk about what I'd like to do next. I plan on staying on 10mg daily because I'm aware of how abused Adderall is. I am already addicted to dip (chew) and love my cups of coffee everyday (3 cups max). My anxiety is gone and that's because my overthinking has disappeared and I now have an unwavering confidence in myself. Of course I'd like to one day STOP taking Adderall and obviously nicotine but as I'm learning about my problems and facing them im not really sure what I'll do. I really like how relaxed I am and how I can snatch my thoughts out of the air instead of seeing them fly by. I will not surpass 15mg a day. I plan on being responsible and careful about my Adderall consumption. Will I be able to quit one day AND feel like my adhd has disappeared or at least turned down a bit? How dangerous is 10-15mg a day to my health? I see a lot of people talk about 60mg a day which makes me cringe. what's it like combining coffee, nicotine and Adderall? Am I even taking the right drug?   Sorry if I rambled a bit here. I enjoy practicing my new found ability to flood my thoughts. Thanks for reading.

I tend to have all the general symptoms: disorganization, procrastination, erratic behavior, unable to focus, etc. The biggest issue I've learned to discover as a result is my self-esteem issues. As a child, I've always been moderately shy. But now that I am an adult, I have a very difficult time in social settings. I find it very difficult to approach or develop the confidence to talk to girls. I also have little success in making friends. People would call me reserved but the sad truth is that I'm not, I'm aching to branch out but I can't because my confidence is so low that I cannot bring myself to do it. Often me and my mom will talk about this and we don't really agree and I usually get very frustrated talking about it. Most conversations about it turn into arguments and result in me throwing/breaking things or saying things I don't mean in anger. I also might add that I have a HUGE anger problem. I was wondering from any redditors with ADHD: how do you guys deal with self esteem issues as a result of ADHD? May this just be a result of some other disorder or a lack of self-confidence in general? Should I try to use a different medication?   Edit: Spelling
cb37a25ecdbccba6502459efda802967bd1ee53ae55b0d69f76cb9bb43c7ddf2;;;my boyfriend has a new diagnosis of adhd, our relationship has now gotten a bit rocky; any advice on how to help support him and be able to carry on through tough days?;;;Not too long ago my boyfriend was diagnosed with adhd, a late diagnosis. It has got to the point He doesn't want to be in school anymore, and our relationship has been quite rocky. We have a very strong bond and connection otherwise in the past. This past month I've been having trouble coping with the changes I've seen in him, esp with any medications he has tried make him feel worse, and not himself. I am trying My hardest to help him out and such, but I feel myself losing patience at times. I've also noticed that I can't drink alcohol and be around him because it seems to make me more angry towards him due to all of this. I really want any advice I can get to help me cope, so I don't ruin the relationship completely.
e625c94915241506695eef17dddffd5906c7d74594ac9ffc371ba2bc4539d4c8;;;I was recently diagnosed (F24) and have some questions for the more weathered ADHDers :);;;Today I got my diagnosis. I have been putting it off since June, when my GP told me that I should probably visit a psychiatrist for my troubles with focussing at work and uni. So, staying true to my chaotic personality, I forgot to make an appointment, lost my referrals several times and finally made an appointment only to forget about it.    Luckily, the practice where I currently am in treatment is used to this lack of structure, so they phoned my GP for a faxed referral, and sent me several texts to remind me of my appointment. That was nice, I felt a bit stupid for being a grown up who couldn't get her shit together, but they helped me out.    Anyway, now I feel quite lost.  So I have a few questions for you guys, as you are probably better at this then I am:   1. I feel really stupid lots of the time for forgetting things. This makes me sad in turn, so overall it's unproductive. How do you cope with this feeling, if you have it as well?   2. Are there any easy ways to keep forgetting stuff? Right now I cope by writing everything down (and then losing the notes) and maintaining a very strict schedule, but it doesn't really work.  3. My shrink advised a combination of medication and coaching. However, the medication might affect my sex drive. Do you experience this? It's my main fear, I enjoy sex with my SO and don't really want to miss out on it.   4. What do you guys do when things get too much in crowded places? I try meditation or focussing on 5 things  I see, 4 things I hear, etc., but it's still hard to focus during meetings at work and such. Not because I don't care because I do, but it's so drawn out and I like efficiency.   5. Do I tell my work? I have a never-ending contract, so there's no risk of being fired or such. My boss did note me not being able to complete some of the paperwork involving my job. However, my performance is pretty nice apart from that (I get good reviews). Most of my co-workers already tease me a bit for being the bundle of chaos that I am, so it's pretty common knowledge but still.  Also: who did and didn't you tell, and why?  6. How do you self-regulate? Like, if I feel overwhelmed I can calm myself by stepping out or taking a walk, but I can never really self-regulate in the moment. Are there small tricks?    But mostly, how do you stop yourself from feeling stupid? Because I feel like I failed some big test or something. I feel sad, I really just want to curl up in a little ball and sleep for the next week.  Luckily my parents still love me and my SO was very kind to me today, giving me cuddles and comfort and a blanket. But I still feel sad. I feel like there's something wrong with me, or that I am just making a fuss and should just stop being lazy.   *Sigh*  Any advice would be much appreciated. I might drift off to sleep, it's evening here (or past midnight) and it's been quite the ride.    p.s. As a thank you for reading, here's a crude joke (if you aren't into black humor, best skip it!)  Where do you send an ADHDer during the summer break? Concentration camp! (^sorry)   tl;dr: I have trouble organizing, and I forget a lot. It's hard to focus when there's a lot happening or things take long. Are there any tips/good books/articles/video's/pictures/etc that helped you? Or do you have general advice? And how do I stop feeling stupid. Also should I notify my coworkers? Who did and didn't you tell?
f6731d91176a9c9f744d9a19b5f3d9712cf1511e8b7cc4f99fbdcdd5baf4e9b7;;;Just started on Concerta (36mg). I feel miserable, pissed off, and anxious.;;;Okay, guys, I'm really struggling here. I was originally on 27mg. But we did some testing and realized some of my inattentive symptoms were not improving. So, we increased my dose. I had about a 2 weeks break between the change.   I started on 36mg 2 days and I feel like I want to go into a rage I can't get shit done because I have this weird wired jittery feeling that's so distracting. I'm also really sad and frustrated. I let my psychiatrist know about this anxiety and he said that it should pass. Is that likely? I don't know how long I can take this for! I should mention that I also suffer from anxiety. So, I administer a 30mg dose of Cymbalta on the side.   Anyone had this experience before?! Help!

We've been here for just a little over a week, and after getting the very basics unpacked the first couple days, we've just kind of...stagnated.  But tonight we finally went grocery shopping and I came home and just powered through it!  I was able to stay focused the whole time and I got everything where I wanted it and didn't slack off or put anything off til tomorrow!  Sorry, this may seem like a bit of a humblebrag, but I'm just genuinely really excited and wanted to share this with people who will understand why.  I hope everyone's having a good week!
0412d57ca174a1630e6ebed2202567dbca3f261e3463e6bccaa01a47c72df2ee;;;ADHD worsened by SSRIs?;;;No judgments please, but since I started on citalopram for anxiety and depression I feel like what ADHD symptoms I had got worsened. The problem is I've never been formally diagnosed with ADHD, I've only been told by my two close friends that it's highly likely I have ADHD, and that I should talk to a doctor about it. The citalopram has made me a far more outgoing person but without my anxiety it feels like I've lost some impulse control. Basically I guess I'm wondering if anyone else has other similar experiences, or if this just means my antidepressant isn't quite the right one?
e7429633f73c478a5783d8afe470e207d4e55da6fb1abdc5f96dc14185111172;;;ADHD, Depression, or both?;;;I went to what I thought would be my ADHD testing, but I was wrong. I had a consultation with a social worker who asked me a lot of questions, ranging from simple questions like “What do you do for a living?", to more complex questions like “What motivates you?" Anyway, at the end of the questions she told me that she thought I may actually be depressed opposed to having ADHD. However, she still gave me a referral for **actual** adhd testing. So I have an appointment for that in a few months AND I'm going to be seeing a psychiatrist regarding her depression suspicions.   I've been reading that most adults who are diagnosed with adhd also have issues with depression. Also when she read the symptoms of depression and inattentive adhd, respectively, in the DSMV they seemed to overlap.   My question is have your adhd symptoms been misdiagnosed as symptoms of depression? Or do you have both depression and adhd?
6c6c3f288c8466d97800c4f29481cea0cfb346d7bbe00e6452c9b3fa02d17479;;;mono and concerta;;;hey guys, I'm looking for advice. I have reason to believe that I have mono, and I was wondering any of you knew how taking concerta affects the recovery process. I'm currently taking 27 mg on weekdays and some weekends, and it has single-handed changed my life when if comes to school. I'm in a challenging first year program and I'm worried that since concerta is a stimulant it'll be detrimental to my health since mono is treated by basically taking it easy and bedrest. On the other hand, I can't afford to take time off from my meds (and by extension, school) if I want to remain in my program. There is very little chance of me being able to catch up on weeks worth of material if do I need to take a break. I tried to see if I could manage without meds last semester and it was totally unmanageable. With the extra fatigue of being sick I'm not feeling too great about my chances of finishing this year.  I'm so fucking frustrated. I've always had trouble with school and I felt like I was finally starting to hit my stride this year because I finally got diagnosed with ADHD (over the summer) and I was learning to deal with it properly so I could study things that actually interest me and I've been the happiest I've ever been in my life these past few months... but health comes first.  TL:DR : pretty sure I have mono, will I be able to keep taking my meds and keep up with school or am I going to be forced to drop out?
6d39a3ef2474b9614600a2ba7263db0c2517eb69d94d89a8e5fe7f8b3a3efa38;;;16 year old and I strongly suspect I have ADHD, but my Asian parents don't want to get me tested and probably won't sign papers or cooperate in the process. Is it possible to get a diagnosis without them being involved?;;;The way I first suspected I have ADHD is mostly through this subreddit. The usual descriptions of ADHD curated by websites are usually pretty vague (nowadays, who isn't inattentive?) and could apply to most people, and since I didn't want to be that teenager who diagnoses himself with a new disorder every other week (OCD, Gluten allergy etc.). ADHD in particular has a reputation for being overly diagnosed, so I just chalked it up to me being especially lazy. However, Redditors are very descriptive in their posts and I suddenly noticed that all these bothersome traits were very very noticeable in me. Everything that I found other people didn't do (I kept track) was in some way related to ADHD.  I do have some doubts, but I've decided that I should get tested. I suggested it offhandedly to my parents, but they're very conservative and since I'm a firstborn Asian son and am supposed to do go to Ivy League (I kinda do, and a diagnosis would actually help) or whatever they are in very deep denial and strongly oppose testing me for it. They also probably would prefer to keep calling me lazy my whole life instead of acknowledging any condition I might have.  **They are unbelievably stereotypical Asian parents**  I really want to get tested for ADHD since it would be a lot of help, but according to Reddit wiki and several other sources, the process takes months, involves a crapton of paperwork and legal declarations, and I might not even be diagnosed since my country, Singapore, has an institutional bias against "laziness" in all its forms. In fact, Adderall is banned here and Ritalin is mostly for children.  During this process, if my parents are informed of any attempts on my part, they have a chance of absolutely flipping out, punishing me severely and it's very likely they won't cooperate. Hence, I'd prefer to do this with as little parental involvement as possible. Problem is, I'm still a dependent (again, 16 years old) so most of the advice related to "do your own diagnosis now that you're a grown-ass man" will not apply.  I don't exactly need any fancy drugs since I've brute forced myself into focus pretty well (i.e. running 13km a day until my head loses blood circulation and also meditation), but I do really need the diagnosis for several reasons. **TL;DR I have super conservative stereotypical Asian parents who refuse to cooperate in diagnosis. As a 16 year old, is there any way I can get a diagnosis without needing their permission (even more preferable if they don't know)?**  EDIT: still reading and responding to all replies, just asleep because sleep is important and delays death

I've spent years debating on whether or not I have ADD, or depression, or if I just have terrible memory.. and I've come to the conclusion (along with some online self tests in which they've further confirmed my self diagnosis) that I do indeed have ADD. My struggle to focus is depressing, especially now that I have a full time job that requires me to think more critically and focus, which I struggle with very much. I've mentioned my memory issue to my doctor, he recommended I go to a neurologist, which I did. He asked me a bunch of questions about my day to day routine, sleeping habits, diet habits, and if I do any drugs. I told him I didn't drink much, diet isn't 100% great but probably better than most/average, but I smoke weed. He instantly blamed all my memory issues on weed and it honestly pissed me off. I'm sick of weed being the scapegoat for my problems. I have friends who smoke boatloads of weed and have great memory recall, great focus, no signs of ADD/depression.  One of my long time best friends smokes weed and he is *literally* a rocket scientist, so I'm sorry if I have a tough time thinking weed is the issue here, although I am aware it's probably not exactly helping. I know I probably have ADD, but my question to you fellow ADD redditors is do all of you have a primary struggle with memory? What I'm trying to do is determine if this is a separate issue from ADD, or if this is a direct effect of having ADD. And if so, what do you do to help cope with it.  Again, long time lurker, so I've learned alot so far, but I'm considering going to a new neurologist in hopes that they aren't going to just blame weed for my problem and wanted some feedback so I have a better approach and hopefully can soon get some real treatment. Thanks all.  EDIT: Spelling corrections.

I think the belief in Free Will hurts the ability for people with ADHD to get help.;;;I'm wondering what this sub thinks about the Free Will debate, considering everyone here wrestles with their 'will' to act certain ways.   I have felt for over 20 years that people do not truly have free will.  There is a ton of philosophical discussion on it, but the real scientific evidence all points to people NOT having free will.  neuroscience, basically any psychology study, etc.  If you have looked into this discussion online at all you will usually find that the argument is just whether or not we have even a tiny tiny bit of free will, but no one really argues that we are truly 'free' anymore.  A friend of mine asked me awhile ago why i cared about this debate.  "What woudl it change, if I agreed that we didn't have free will".    And the other day I realized, ADHD is the perfect example.  Because people want to believe in free will, they think that people can just 'focus more!' or 'make sure to pay attention in class!'     American society even admits that some things are not truly free, and we put those things in a bucket of 'exceptions'.  Alcoholism for example.  We put a label on it and then people *usually* understand and forgive, or try to forgive someone who is struggling.  "Oh she has alcoholism, poor thing".  On the block is Anxiety and Depression.  The academic community has Labeled this issue and many people realize its not somthing you can just power through but even still, many people still say that people with anxiety just need to 'cheer up, think positive!'  They say that because they feel we are Free.  For humans to have free will though, it would mean our brains violate the known laws of physics.  And it would mean our brains are the ONLY thing we have ever come across in our scientific investigations, that does violate those rules.  Seems pretty unlikely to me.    Over time, as people have a family member or friend who experiences anxiety, depression, alcoholism, ADHD,etc.  they will start to realize that the person isn't able to just work their way out of the issue on their own, so they internally label that thing as 'uncontrollable'.   So society changes slowly, it takes generations I think for people to meet someone with a mental issue, and realize it is beyond their control.  ADHD is even tougher than many other mental issues though IMO, because we CAN focus at times (when we are focused on something interesting) and the issue is similar to what everyone struggles with (keeping attention on something boring).  They fail to realize that for them paying attention is a mild uphill 3 mile hike, while for others paying attention is like scaling mt everest barefoot.  Anyway as usual Im kind of rambling but this just bugs me that science supports the No Free Will theory, and if people would accept it, mental health issues would get a lot more attention and help.  Instead, people assume that someone can overcome a mental disability easily, not realizing its akin to telling someone with a broken leg to go run a marathon.  We wouldnt do that because the injury or disability is clearly visible, and a person cannot just magically choose to heal their broken leg.  With ADHD, the 'injury' is not visible, and people feel that if we have an issue we can just choose to fix it.  "just focus more!"

I was worried that if I didn't have ADHD that I wouldn't be able to figure out what my problems were stemming from.   Today,  I was informed by my counselor that I did have ADHD-PI. I also have anxiety. It just feels good to know what's going on with my brain! I'm also excited to use some of the resources at my college to help me study better. I thought I'd share this with you all :)  Tomorrow I'll be meeting with my school psychiatrist to talk about medication.   It's funny because my mother has always joked that I had ADHD. She was right. I've also suspected this for a while now.  TL;DR: Got diagnosed with ADHD-PI and anxiety. Feels good to know what's up with my brain!

Once in Baltimore and again when I moved back home to central NY when I graduated college. It seems all the psychiatrists and doctors in my area "don't believe in stimulants." Instead, they tried to put me on Serotonin reuptake inhibitors because I mentioned I have social anxiety. Really not into those or interested in anything I can't choose to straight up stop taking on a dime.  When I have taken adderal I felt like a normal person, even losing my social anxiety. I don't feel like I'm high on something or in GO mode. In fact I feel much more calm and relaxed while on it. I feel like I can actually focus and get things done, I'm not overwhelmed by projects. I just want to be able to be a functioning person.   Doctors and psychiatrists often have over 6 months wait to be evaluated. I'm very frustrated. Does anyone have any advice? Similar frustrations? I'm tired of being treated like a drug seeker and I'm tired of unsuccessfully self medicating with ungodly amounts of coffee. I've tried to reduce my caffeine in the last year and it makes it even harder than before.   It feels unfair as I have many friends who have easy access to stimulants even though I have serious doubts that they need it and watch them abuse it while I sit here just wanting to function properly. I would never consider binging as I like to sleep. Their doctors are family doctors who are not accepting new patients as well.   All my life I have struggled where other people have no problems. I thought I was just a lazy daydreamer and would constantly curse my nature. I never considered ADHD because I am a calm person, and though I am always moving its contained and isolated to a single limb at a time and I'm not bouncing off the walls. When I finally realized what was wrong and that everyone's ADHD has different attributes it was my last semester of my senior year.  Now I'm just trying to get help to get by in life but doctors don't seem to trust me with medication.   If I didn't need it I absolutely would not want to be on it. I am an adult and I am responsible. I like having an appetite, it's hard enough for me to build muscle. I don't like things that mess with my sleep. It's the only thing that has been effective so far however, and so I'm looking for a doctor who might understand. Why is it such a terrible thing that I know what works for me and don't want to be on something that I will be physically dependent on?  Sorry for such a long post, I am venting and I feel better now. Thank you if you got through the whole thing!  TLDR: been diagnosed with ADHD, treated like a drug seeker and doctors are not willing to help me

Family and friends have noticed a significant difference in my concentration and behavior whilst on the medication, as to when I'm not on it (I usually stop during summer months).. However, it comes with waves of depression, disassociation, nausea, dizziness and sometimes unbearable sedation. I would love to stop it, but without it I am unable to function in an academic environment - so for two years I have pushed through these adverse effects but I've reached a point where I'm not sure I can handle it any longer. I am unable to discuss this with my physicians as they would prefer to take me off it. They see ADHD as a developmental disorder and think that I would no longer need this, I've tested this during summer months but family, friends &amp; colleagues all comment on my inability to focus when I am off it. Where do I go from here? I'm feeling very lost.   Here's a little background on me that may help guide anyone who would live to advise me on what to do:  - 20 years of age, diagnosed ADHD at 16  - Prescribed Straterra, have been on it since 17/18, currently on 60mg  - Live in the UK so Straterra is pretty much the only ADHD medication that is allowed to be prescribed, especially to someone my age

Right now my career is a cross roads.  I work as a Financial Analyst for a health insurance company and feel things are stuck in neutral.  The position is not the best fit for my skills and interest.  I'm a big picture thinker and inductive learned who will never excel at the details (not horrible at details but it will never be a strength) and feel I'm constantly swimming upstream.  My goal is find a role that build on my financial background (10 years working experience and an MBA) that isn't too much in the weeds all the time and is more big picture focused.  Does anyone have any suggestions?
627a7316fddd241cb6af946d486d208cdc3a729385ced26630469434e254e974;;;I'm having really vivid dreams leading up to my assessment.;;;I'm booked in for an initial assessment for adult ADHD at the beginning of February. It took me a couple of years from the first moment of "Wait that sounds exactly like *every problem in my life* .....nah......can't be......but *Holy shit* did they study me and write this?" to actually build up the courage to ask somebody about it, then six weeks of trying to stick to this timetable my doctor wanted me to try first, several more weeks while I kept forgetting to and/or procrastinating about phoning the clinic, and now I've been on a waiting list for months, so it's kind of nerve wracking to finally be at this point.  They sound very friendly but I am so worried about forgetting things. I need to get a referral form from my doctor so that the assessment is covered by health insurance. I asked my mum for my old school reports, and she told me to check in the rex box file, which I have, but I need to get down and look through, and they will send me a questionnaire by post, too, that I'm getting extra time to fill out because it will be in German.  Then I've been having really vivid dreams. The first was that I went to the assessment, and they handed me some huge report and said "Okay so this is what you have" and I left feeling a bit, um, okay, it was that easy? But I woke up thinking I'd done the assessment and it was disappointing and frustrating to realise I haven't yet.  Then the next one was more intense. I dreamed that I was working at a college. I'm a language teacher, so this isn't outlandish. In the dream, I saw on my Dad's facebook page that he had booked an event where a private ADHD coach would come to his home and he was inviting people to it. I was really intrigued and interested, because when I started to learn more about ADHD and the heritability of it, I started to see my Dad in a lot of it and especially some things that he has been struggling this year. But in real life, we're not close enough for me to talk to him about it yet. In fact we're pretty distant. I'm too nervous of how he would react if I said I'm thinking that I may have it, let alone question whether he does. Not because I know him to react badly, more that I don't even know him well enough to have any idea of how he would react.  So, anyway. I was at work in the dream and I was in the library and these books were just floating around the place and I was like, woah, what is happening? And someone else said, oh, that's just the invisible library assistants, like it was a totally normal thing. Then they casually added that if you look in a mirror, you can see the invisible assistants. I started to notice a quiet muttering voice which sounded familiar, and sure enough when I looked in a mirror, there was my Dad being an invisible library assistant. I put my hand on his chest to stop him and said "Hey, Dad." He noticed me, became visible, and said that he'd decided to work there so he could spend time with me, but he felt awkward, so he wanted to be invisible. Then he said that the ADHD coach event was for me, he didn't want anybody else to go, he wanted to support me and that I would be okay. I was kind of disappointed that he didn't recognise it within himself too, but touched that he would do that for me, especially as he hadn't known before. Then we kind of fast-forwarded to being at my house, and my stepmum was there and my half siblings were running around but much younger, like the same age as my son, and they all played together and my Dad and stepmum were like "We want to be a more involved part of your life!"  I mean, it was kind of... awesome but just so vivid and intense, and then mixed emotions when I woke up. I'm finding this whole thing exhausting! I've only known about the appointment for a week. Does it get better? Will I be less adrenaline-y when the actual assessment process has started? Am I going to be a ball of uselessness on the actual day? I'm going alone and it's a 90 minute train journey, so any tips would be helpful. I'm planning to take some rescue remedy (my bottle is so old it's probably more placebo than it was to begin with, but it helps) and put some calming, comforting old music on my phone and maybe some comfort TV too, but anything else would be good to know.  TL;DR: Having assessment in a few weeks. Having some weird mind trips about it. Is this normal, and also, please talk to me about everything including my probably boring dream so that I don't dissolve in a ball of anxiety in the office.

I tried a few times to get help, but this is the first time I made it to the point of evaluation. Three months of appointments, questionnaires, and computer tests and I just get told that my concentration and memory issues aren't severe enough for a diagnoses.  I'm completely disheartened.  I struggle with basic things. I tune out in class and during conversations all the time. I have bad working memory and even worse long term memory. I don't have any specific interests. I'm not good or knowledgeable about anything because I can't sustain interest. I struggle to get good grades at the expense of a lot of things and perhaps partly due to the fact that I get good grades, I'm not believed when I tell people I think I have ADHD.  What kind of life is this? How am I supposed to take care of myself when I struggle with every aspect of day to day living such that it affects my school work, job, and floundering social life?  My last hope was that trying medication might help and now I feel hopeless. Nobody believes me. Nobody thinks I'm struggling.

I was diagnosed with ADHD last month and started concerta (18mg) 4 days ago. I have been a semi heavy marijuana smoker for the past 3 years and I have not smoked since starting my medication. I have been noticing some side effects and I'm not sure if it is marijuana withdrawal or side effects from the concerta. I feel dehydrated, despite drinking tons of water, irritable, a little nauseous and kind of anxious. The concerta has helped with my focus and attention but my mind has been feeling kind of blank. I have 10 days left on my prescription before I see my doc again. My question is, have any marijuana smokers who have started meds experienced anything like this? I cannot get into my doc any earlier as he has no appointments available. Any insight would be great!
ef70d76a74efe35172695247ba4c0e9bde7384a45b70705f1275d95f039087c3;;;Seroquel?;;;I was recently diagnosed and put on Adderall IR (20mg 2x) daily. I started at 10 and couldn't stay awake and with the dosage adjustments, it's been a bit of a ride since.   Basically, I feel like I'm taking a different med every day. On the best days, I feel mildly better overall and slightly more productive but still have multiple trains of thought, awful judgement of time, etc. On the "ok" days, I feel mostly sleepy or nothing at all. And on bad days, I get jumpy and can't sleep. I think I can attribute a lot of this to my lack of schedule- between my job, my husbands job and our kids, my routine varies greatly from day to day. I don't get regular sleep and I definitely don't take the adderall at the same time every day. As such, I'm totally not giving up and writing it off yet because I know that proper sleep and nutrition are essential to its function.   At my follow up with my doctor the other day, I told her all of this and she prescribed 50mg of seroquel at night to help me "shut off" because the hardest part of the come down for me is the body tiredness paired with an ULTRA racing mind that won't allow the body to rest. She said it would take a little while to get used to and I would probably be groggy for a bit at first- which I'm ok with. I'll manage. I know (and she explained) that it's an anti psychotic with varied off label uses and she said she very frequently pairs it with stimulants- at a low dose.   So I did a little MORE research and I'm seeing that at such a low dose, it's basically a histamine blocker. I can't take non drowsy Dramamine without sleeping for 3 days straight. Benadryl? Forget it. I guess now I'm just anxious this is going to level me. I have kids that I am responsible for during the day- no one else is home. I can't be losing consciousness involuntarily like I do when I take allergy/motion sickness meds. Does anyone have any experience? I am thinking I'll wait and try it over the weekend when my husband will be home and then go from there.  Does anyone have any experience with the combination in general? Does it even have any mood stabilizing effects at this low of a dose?   Thanks :)

I recently went back on Adderall but I still get that "manic, euphoric, almost hyper focused energy for the first few hours after taking it.....is this a sign that I may NOT actually have ADHD, or is this a side effect of the medicine that everyone gets?

I'm noticing that around that time of the month (both when it starts and a week beforehand) my anxiety and ADHD seem to get worse (just more that I'll start feeling the symptoms when I normally wouldn't). I'm already aware about the whole "meds are less effective" thing.  In short:  1) Is it normal for my anxiety and ADHD to "ramp up" around that time of the month?   2) How do you manage it when that time comes?  3) I work in a shared office with 3 other people. Would it be more beneficial for me to be working alone around that time of the month (or in general) to ensure that I'm not likely to cause further issues? (I've already found that working somewhere that's not my office tends to increase my productivity). Alternately, any tips for helping this? My coworkers and boss are all aware about my issues (my boss also hired me knowing full well I have anxiety)

This is one of my first real attempts to talk about my ADHD with anyone outside of Health Care providers and my wife, so I'm not quite sure what direction this will take.  A little over a year ago my wife asked me if I had ever talked to anyone about my ADHD. I was puzzled. What was she talking about? I asked her what she meant and she told me she thought it was best to talk to my PCP about it. I asked a few other people and took a few of the self-diagnostics online. Everyone I asked and the tests pointed to me needing to speak with my doc.   I was quite perplexed. How had I gone 30 years without a diagnosis? In an age where everyone was getting diagnosed and medicated for ADHD, how could I have "slipped through the cracks." I remember as a child, realizing I thought differently compared to my peers. I was able to multitask my thinking process allowing me to process multiple ideas at once. "How cool!" I thought.  I had always had good grades and I was identified as gifted at an early age. I went to a decently prestigious university (those darn student loans!) and did have a problem going to class and doing required readings. But I graduated without a hitch with a useless degree in world religions.  During college, I took a side job training dogs at a national retailer. It was something I was relatively interested in so I was really able to hyper-focus on learning a new trade. Well right about the time I graduated was when the job market started to plummet. So I stayed on with the pet store as a retail manager for about a year. I was then approached by a local animal shelter to join their team as a behavior consultant and adoptions manager. I was at that job for about a 2 years before taking a job at a large animal sanctuary as a dog trainer. I was at the job for about a year before I left for various reasons, but primarily to be closer to new wife's family as we had just found out that she (we?) was pregnant. I did some work as a private contractor for a service dog training organization for about 9 months. I loved the job but required too much travel, for my wife and I having a newborn. So I found a job at a well-known animal shelter as their assistant shelter manager. I did that job for about a year and a half before taking my current role in the organization where I am the manager and lead trainer of pet training facility.  Throughout each of these jobs, I excelled in the areas that required me working with animals and training, but failed horribly in the parts that were medial and mundane: answering emails, reports, training logs, etc.   With my current position, it requires a lot of multitasking, interruptions, and mundane tasks. I am still excelling at the dog training part, but I've lost my passion for it. I am closely related to the humane sheltering world still, which causes a lot of personal anxiety. I am the only behavior consultant in my area, so I tend to be the last hope for dogs. This puts a lot of pressure on me, especially when I have to make a recommendation for euthanasia. I'm bombarded by various organizations for help with various animals that are in desperate need of help. So I always take my work home with me. Add to that the stress of basically running my own business. I haven't talked to my boss about this yet either.  About a year ago I went to see a clinical psychologist who diagnosed me with ADHD. My PCP has put me on 30 mg of Adderall XR. I take it only during my work days, but I still feel the anxiety on the weekends. It definitely helps me stay on task.   Quite frankly, I feel pretty depressed most days and anxious a lot too. I'm really considering changing careers to something with a little less stress and something I don't have to bring home with me. Maybe a job that is 9-5 or something that has a small amount of traveling. I'm just not sure where to start. I started college as a computer engineer before changing my major my second semester, but I have been out of the programming, networking, IT realm for a while.  I'm not sure what I am expecting from you all, but any advice really helps. Thanks in advance for any and all help. I'm shooting a video today to help surrounding shelters implement some basic assessments and enrichment tools, so I maybe get a little behind on my replies.  TL;DR I feel like I'm drowning with my ADHD, my job is suffering, and I need some career advice.  Edit: Grammar and punctuation. I'm sure there is more but now I'm running late.

I've heard that 10mg doesn't really do much for most people so I was wondering if I should go ahead and start it tomorrow or if I should wait until the weekend? I have only told one person at work so she can keep an eye on me if I start acting super weird on it but I'm wondering if it's a better idea to wait and see what happens on Saturday where only my roommate will see me. Thanks!

I'd yell very loudly and get scary, or go totally to the other side and not do much but tell him it was bad. (But I'd *never* hit him.)    I've been working on consistency (which is so, so hard with ADHD) and I've been getting better, but it's still hard to get proportionality right.    Today, my (probably extremely ADHD) son intentionally (if it had been a mistake, I wouldn't have been so upset) scratched our new coffee table with a toy knife. I took the knife from him, told him that if he couldn't be responsible, he couldn't have toys like that anymore, and sent him to his room. Every impulse was screaming at me to yell and be scary, but I didn't. I let him think a while, then I went up to talk to him about why damaging things isn't okay, and how it's important to show respect to each other by trying to keep things nice. He understands, and I've taken his play date privileges for tomorrow, since we had no special plans today. I also explained that, while I really didn't like what he *did*, I still love *him* no matter what happens.    I think I've figured out how to discipline my son without tearing down his self-esteem, which is rough enough in those of us with ADHD. Now I just need to remember what this feels like so I can keep doing it! :)
1b87fedd04caa9d19d25d3acee7f385db63eab40bae3709c6c502438aba28941;;;Currently on trial medication, got a REALLY important interview for university on friday. Should I go medicated or unmedicated?;;;Currently taking Concerta XL 18-mg which might not seem like much. This was just for the trial period which also happens to be ending on friday.       The course I'm applying to is design engineering at one of the more prestigious colleges, and from what I've seen theyre currently taking on the most passionate students(towards the course).      Without medication, Im just looking around, hard to maintain eye contact, and fidgeting, but I will go on and on about the topic, and keep the conversation interesting.   &gt; Ie : "so tell me about what you did in X" "So, in my college we have x and y. X is the more practical side, y is the more theory side. Now with Y, we were meeting with Z to learn about D. With X on the other hand we.............................(go on about it)" .. You get the idea    I haven't tried having a practice interview with medication, but I feel like it might make me less likely to go rambling, which can be a good thing as I would answer the question they ask me directly, no bullshit, but on the other hand this might be regarded as lack of enthusiasm, or something along these lines. I have noticed it can make me more chatty, but at the same time Ive noticed it making me quite boring and focused on one topic, refusing to change conversation topic.       I hadnt thought about this and simply thought Id go into the interview medicated to appear more professional, but since this is a creativity and STEM driven course Im not sure, and I think its a bit late to contact my psychologist, so Im looking for help here.     Thanks in advance.      TL;DR Really important interview for creativity/science and maths driven university degree. Meds make me more focused but Im not sure if that would be what is needed in this. Might appear unenthusiastic

I'm 22 now, in my first semester of nursing school. Studying with add is hard but I'm disciplined enough. It's the clinicals that are getting me messed up. It's hard to understand all the directions the instructor is giving. I keep making mistakes because I didn't follow directions. Sometimes I didn't even hear her say something because I got distracted by my own thought. Sometimes she'll say something and I cling on to what she said and totally miss out out what she's saying after. It's becoming a big problem and I will be written up if I mess up clinical again. I'm seeing my doctor tomorrow to talk about my adhd. What can I do right now to help my problem? What drugs work best? What techniques help to follow and listen to verbal instructions? How do I use add meds? What are the side effects?

Dextro-amphetamines don't really do much for me and Strattera is okay. Although I've been reading about dextro-methylphenidate for a while now and it might be the solution to my medication problem. The problem that I face right now is that I can't seem to get it in the Netherlands. It is not illegal, but it's just not (widely available) on the market. Although it isn't in our national database of medications. I've read that some pharmacies in the Netherlands make a generic of it, but all of those are unnamed in the reviews/blog posts I read and I can't seem to retrieve them through there either. My psychiatrist hasn't heard of it either, but he is willing to consider it. Now it would be nice if we can actually find a pharmacist in the Netherlands. So my question is does anyone know of such a pharmacist in the Netherlands. Or possibly another way to get it here?  ~Yami_Bas

Once i got to my answer i went back through my working and had a really hard time actually keeping up with the many stages i had just been through!    I had JUST worked it out and then my brain decided it couldn't handle it any more. I managed to come back to it and work it out again s l o w l y.    Once i got a handle of it again i know that i find the calculations really straight-forward. It was just the fact that i had to follow the train of thought in one go that i struggled with.   To be honest, although it was frustrating, i also found it vaguely amusing/curious to *feel* my attention just evaporate in to thin air!

I would get good grades (besides math) up until the 4th grade. During 5th grade i just.... Stopped doing homework for some reason, ever since then it's been an intense battle for me attempting to do work. I've never been able to fully concentrate in class. When I was diagnosed with ADD and/or ADHD my doctor asked my parents if it was ok to put me on medication to help me with ADHD, my parents were fearful of side effects and such and refused... I really really wished they said yes to the pills.  I failed middle school and i am now currently in highschool, With the living fear that I will end up as a drop out by this time next year. My grades are terrible, F's in nearly all my classes. I don't wanna keep going thru this. I keep trying to change and do work but I keep becoming Lazy and dozing off. I keep on getting more comfortable.   Please please help me.

Meanwhile, I went to visit family in Colorado last week and smoked the whole time I was over there. While it's legal there, it isn't where I live. Today I was talking with someone who had mentioned her sons doctor drug tests her each month before allowing her to refill his meds. Now I'm really worried. We see my son's doctor in 2 days. Is this common practice? Will they care about weed or only care about making sure his meds aren't in my system?
92da1a7f6800c37098e42bb25cf13d12726519d257848fb388ffffce70e2ac54;;;First day on Concerta 18mg, ADHD symptoms worsened, lots of side effects. Do I need higher dose or med not for me?;;;Hi there,  I was diagnosed with ADHD-PI last year and took my first Concerta 18mg this morning at 9.30am (breakfast was protein bar and some coffee around 8).   Pretty soon, I started noticing side effects: muscle-tension in upper back, increased urinary frequency, a feeling of disconnect from the world, decreased ability to interact with others, utter lack of motivation, a depressed mood, and most surprisingly, an even lower attention span.   I made more mistakes at work today than I've been making lately when I was off meds!   This is the third ADHD medication I've been on, second stimulant. Vyvanse was horrible for me (too much anxiety and nervousness without therapeutic effects), Strattera didn't really work. I've taken Adderall once without prescription and it was a miracle worker (however, I didn't want to tell my psychiatrist this as I don't want her to think I'm peddling for drugs). When she put me on Concerta she said the dose might be low, so I'm wondering if maybe I just need to up the dosage, or if this medication is not for me.  Has anyone suffered any ill-effects like I am today while on Concerta? Should I ask for a higher dose? If so, when? My next appointment is in 3 weeks.  Edit: I'm 30 F, 5'1, 100 lbs.  Thanks, all!  TL;DR: First day on Concerta 18mg but not feeling therapeutic effects, only side effects. Do I need higher dose or switch to new meds?
0980dde7a68e1ca4bea840820e103b3f76801928966ebee87f7472a5902483eb;;;Having a hard time finding the right meds;;;I was diagnosed November 2015 (I'm 31) and my doctor prescribed Ritalin SR 20mg which worked GREAT for the first few days then the effect dropped drastically. I had some minor side effects, dry mouth, minor weight loss. My sleeping pattern improved DRAMATICALLY, I was feeling tired around 5pm and I would go to bed around 10-11 (instead of 2-5am)  I had a follow up after a month and she decided to have my try Adderall XR instead, I believe it was 10mg the first week and 20mg after that. My concentration level stayed around he same, but my wife noticed I was more aggressive and I would get stuck on minor details. Side effects were the same but my sleep pattern went back to "regular" and I would go to bed really late.  At my monthly follow up she decided to switch it to Biphentin 10mg for the first week and 20mg after. This medication did NOT agree with me at all. The first week I thought it was some kind of withdrawal affect from the Adderall but once I started taking 20mg I knew something was wrong, I didn't feel like myself at all, I would hyper focus on everything and I could feel myself get angry but i felt like i couldn't stop it. I stopped taking it after 2 days of 20mg and went back to the doctor. At that point I was still getting the dry mouth and slight weight loss.  New prescription is 20mg of Ritalin SR in the morning and another 20mg after lunch. The weird thing is the side effects all seem to be gone (no more dry mouth and my weight went back up a bit), but also my concentration is not even at the level it was when I was taking the original prescription of just 20mg a day. I'm starting to wonder that maybe pills aren't helping me and maybe I should just stop taking them and attempt to deal with my issues on my own, any one else had issues figuring out the right medication? I've been taking the 2 x 20mg for a month now.  TL;DR: Started on Ritalin SR, helped quite a bit but the effect didn't last. Switched to Adderal XR that brought some issues so I was switched to Biphentin which REALLY didn't work out. Back on Ritalin SR but I feel like it's not helping.
ff598a1ce0498571ec15dd3903be22e110522e9ab5e33021a918b2efa54b2214;;;[Warning: Long] How ADHD ruined my life - my story of growing up undiagnosed;;;I've been thinking about making this post for days. It's long and depressing, but I really hope I can help someone else by telling it. I've spent the last year thinking about my past and how it was to grow up undiagnosed, and how painful it is being a girl who is told they are lazy and bad. I finally got diagnosed last year at 24, and although it's not as late as some of you, significant damage has been done to my self esteem. I really just want to write this out so that if people saw these symptoms in other people they know, they wouldn’t just give up on them and might give them a second chance.  Ever since I was 7 years old (I couldn’t find any reports older than that) my school teachers commented on how I was always forgetting things. My report card also always said “has trouble remembering to do homework”, “has trouble with being on time” and “has trouble with organization”. I talked to my parents about this recently and they gave me a couple of different answers. My dad said he thought it was just a phase that I would grow out of, and didn’t think it was a serious problem. My mum thought I had some kind of dyslexia that affects organization, but didn’t see it as much of an issue because I was still getting decent grades at school and had no trouble with writing.  I got to secondary school and admittedly the first year went quite well even though I sometimes forgot to do my homework or bring the right things. I remember one assignment where I worked really hard and spent so much time making a great poster, but the poster was about the wrong topic entirely and so I got a lower grade.  Then my auntie died of cancer and my parents were going through a separation within the same year or so. My parents became less supportive as they spent more time thinking about their imminent divorce and I became even more prone to losing things as I spent alternate weeks at different houses. I started getting in trouble more at school because I was always losing things. I didn’t do my homework and was often accused of using my parent’s divorce as an excuse for being lazy. I started to dread the humiliation of being called out for forgetting my homework yet again. Teachers grew to dislike and distrust me, and I ended up getting picked on by some of the meaner teachers and was given horrible reports. I started skipping school often, either faking sick or just running away from the campus. I would often hide in the school bathrooms for hours just to avoid teachers I didn’t like.  Eventually it got so bad that I missed too much school and was told I’d have to repeat a grade. I was starting to self-harm and would get drunk off my parent’s alcohol stash often and started smoking. I was 14 years old. During this time my parents got back together and thought that it would solve all of my problems. My dad decided to move me to another school where he worked so he could keep an eye on me. Everyone thought I was just acting out because of their breakup. I couldn’t explain why I didn’t do my homework and I didn’t understand why I wasn’t able to just do what I was supposed to. I knew I was intelligent and I knew I was capable but the work never got done. If I could only just apply myself more! Why couldn’t I just apply myself? Try harder - stop being so god damn lazy!  So I started at another school and things just got worse. The teachers liked me a little more as they were often friends with my dad, but the expectations were higher and it felt like a much more personal failure when I couldn’t get my homework done as I was letting my dad down. The other students in my year thought I was a trouble maker and I found it hard to make friends. One time my class was meant to pitch in together for a cake for our teacher and I once again forgot to bring in my share of the money. My classmate just sighed and said “you NEVER have any money, do you?”.  Eventually I got back into my ways of skipping school and just gave up. My parents lost patience with me and I barely spoke to them, and I was getting numerous detentions and in-school suspensions for skipping classes and forgetting homework. I dropped out of high school a year early and moved in with an aunt and uncle who lived in another country.  I went to a finishing school to study art and design to make up for the last year of high school. Being away from my parents and being in a totally new environment made a big difference. I started feeling better about myself but still struggled with handing in my homework. The teachers really tried with me and gave me better grades than I deserved because they saw my potential. I remember having a chat with one of my teachers about why I hadn’t done my work again. I told him my head just always feels clouded. There’s no sharpness. No bright spark where you know what you need to do. It’s like there’s a big fog and I can’t think through it. He gave me a look and said I might want to talk to a doctor about that, but that’s as far as it went.  The deadline for my final project at finishing school was closing in and I hadn’t done nearly enough work. My two tutors on my final project ended up having a conversation with me that I will never forget. They told me to get all of my work from the past two years and put it out on a table. Next to mine was another person’s collected work. My pile was a lot smaller than theirs. My teachers looked through everything I had done and said I had a lot of talent and I had some great ideas, but the amount I had done and the sloppy condition of my work told them that I just didn’t care. My sketchbook was bare and my designs were often unfinished. Everything either looked rushed or messy. Some of my old art pieces were ripped or folded because they hadn’t been put away properly. In that moment I hated myself so deeply because I actually cared so much. I had been so happy and had been working hard. I really believed that I was doing well. But looking at the small pile of messy unfinished work made me realize that I just wasn’t doing enough.  Luckily my tutors gave me a good grade in the end, but I didn’t feel as though I truly earned it (and deep down I know I could have done better). But I got into university, which is what really mattered, and was resolved to do better this time and REALLY try. I dropped out after the first year. After such consistent failure I was starting to research what was wrong with me on the internet. Was it depression from my parent’s brief separation and my auntie’s death? Was I just not trying hard enough, and my problems a product of bad circumstance? At first I didn’t believe it could be ADHD – half of the diagnosis fitted perfectly, but the other half wasn’t there at all. No hyperactivity, not too bad at paying attention at school, not so easy to distract (especially when playing video games). Perhaps it was depression - but I felt fine and happy as a child, and fine and happy when I was at finishing school and the problems were still there. Maybe I WAS just lazy after all – I had managed to do lots of work when it was a project that really interested me, and I had such a chip on my shoulder that it was probably just bad attitude.  I started working at a kindergarten as an assistant which went really well. I was often asked to be creative or spend time playing with the children and rarely had to do anything that required planning in advance. My boss was really impressed with my work and asked me if I could move up to teaching playgroup the next year. Suddenly everything went back to the old ways – I was late handing in work, everything was either lost or damaged and I was unable to stay organized past a week. I started feeling really depressed. How come I just couldn’t do it? I started to get a reputation again of being lazy, careless and forgetful. I felt so awful about myself that after a year and a half I was ready to kill myself. I told my boss and she took me to see a psychiatrist who said I probably just had depression and bad parenting. I was just stressed out. People were telling me again that I didn’t seem to care about my work, but inside I cared so deeply. I wanted to do better. I didn’t want to be rushing to do my planning or forgetting to send home important notices. Somehow I still wasn’t good enough.  I finally went to see another therapist who gave me my adhd diagnosis. I was given Ritalin and Wellbutrin, and finished my last school year before quitting my job. I won’t laud the benefits of medication here because honestly it’s too little too late. Medication works, I get benefits from taking it, but the past 15 years of my life were ruined from being overlooked. Maybe if I was a boy I would have been treated differently. Maybe someone would have noticed my symptoms which seem so obvious to me in hindsight. My symptoms didn’t really start to show until I was 7 years old, and even then it wasn’t causing me significant problems until my teens.  Right now my family still doesn’t believe I have adhd and just think I need to apply myself more, try a little harder. They think I have “computer brain” from spending too much time playing games, and just think I like being lazy and making excuses. I still have a lot of animosity towards them for not seeing what I see, but I am working hard at forgiveness. Perhaps I am writing it all down so I can let go of the past, but it still hurts a lot to think about my old self and how much I suffered.   This ended up being massive - sorry about the length. I'll be amazed if anyone actually reads this on this subreddit! If you made it this far, thank you for listening.

What does it mean?;;;So I grew up as a pretty hyper kid like a lot of other children, eventually being diagnosed (although potentially unofficially) by my doctor with ADHD. He suggested I start wearing one of those patches to help around the end of 6th grade. Being a kid I was scared of the patch because I was afraid it would make me different from everyone else or something so I convinced my parents that I could do better in school and that I did not need the patch. The next year I got straight A's. Fast forward to now and I am 20 years old still without medication, doing just fine. Was my doctor wrong? Did I just grow out of it? *Can* one grow out of ADHD or ADD? Anybody else have the same experience? Just curious.

(just sharing happy stuff);;;**TL;DR I have ADHD, my life suddenly make sense, it can only get better!**  I read an account online a week or so back, and thought "WTF, this is my life!" And everyone was recommending that this person got checked for adult ADHD. So, I kept reading and reading, and I identify with all symptoms of inattentive ADHD.    My life makes so much more sense now.   I am trying medication (concetra 27mg, no side effects yet), and so far it's working, for an hour or 4, 5. After that I zone out for 2 hours or so, and then I'm back to relatively normal. Well, my old normal.    I'm realizing now that how I feel in the mornings is how real normal people feel all the time. I'm amazed and relieved. I feel like I can maybe finally achieve something real in my life.    Bonus points is that I have more energy, and less appetite. Hopefully that'll help doing exercise and losing weight.   I also never realized how much tension and anxiety (physical) I am carrying around all day, every day, until suddenly it was gone for a few hours...   It'll probably take a few months before we find the exact right medicine for me, but that's ok. I know it can only get better from here on out!

I was diagnosed with ADHD several years ago but wasn't treating it for a while, then I went to get treated for it and my psychiatrist said I have moderate depression. He said I could take antidepressants along with adderall but I decided to try CBT instead and see if that worked. This was all last May when I got started with adderall.  I have been doing CBT since then and while I feel like that along with adderall has helped me, I still have mood swings a lot and I get easily angry and some days I still do feel depressed, but it's not as many days and I feel less self loathing generally than I used to. I still feel pretty unmotivated most of the time unless there is an urgent need to do something, and I feel negative a lot. I told all this to my psychiatrist and he again said I could take antidepressants if I wanted. I'm just not sure if I want to because my sister and one of my friends took antidepressants and had a bad experience. I'm just not sure if it could help or if it would just make things worse.  I'm looking for if anyone could share their experience with taking adderall and antidepressants, and what kind you took. I have tried to do some research on my own but it is overwhelming with the amount of antidepressants out there. I'm going to ask my therapist as well when I go see her in 2 weeks.
67d9fe5aea475859010f92b2af336d098e4890ddd5f5a531053b87ba5b481b0d;;;I am AuPairing an 8 year old girl who was just diagnosed with ADHD. Any Insider Tips on how do get her to do basically everything especially homework?;;;Hi subreddit ADHD!  Tl,dr: No experience with ADHD whatsoever, how to I get an 8 year old to do stuff with as little frustration and anger as possible on both sides?  So here's the deal, I am an AuPair in the USA right now and one of the children I take care of was just diagnosed with with ADHD. I kinds suspected it to be honest but blamed a lot of the problems I had with her on cultural differences in parenting and stuff like that.  Now here is the deal:  I get super frustrated because I have to say everything a million times before she listens. At some point I will usually yell at her and I hate doing that, but it is the only way she will actually get something done for a couple of minutes.   I have the most trouble with everything homework related. I am usually able to make her Reading and Social Studies interesting enough to keep her mostly focused, but I have no idea what to do with Math and Spelling.   When something doesn't go her way she throws huge tantrums. Like this week, we where on our way to the music school and halfway there when she noticed that she had forgotten her IPad, we usually have to wait for her sister to be done with her lesson so she takes something to occupy herself.  I refused to turn around because it would have made us 15 minutes late for a 30 minute lesson and she started kicking in her seat, screaming that she hates me and I ruin her life for the remaining 10 minutes of the car ride. Stuff like that happens constantly over the tiniest things.  Her mom and I had a long conversation on how to deal with everything but she has two other kids, works a ton and is about as experienced with ADHD as I am. Her strategy is usually to avoid conflict whenever possible but I guess that's where the cultural difference kicks in because I cannot stand it when kids always get it their way. I also don't see why I should do things for her that she should be and is capable of doing herself, like putting away her shoes and coat. She also has an older sister who obviously stops doing those things the second I do it for her sister while trying to avoid conflict.  I have never dealt with anything like this, I can get myself focused on pretty much anything so I have a hard time to put myself in her place.    I would really appreciate it if anyone could share ideas. What helps/helped you, especially when you where younger? How would you have wanted people to treat you?  Also I apologize for any grammar, vocabulary and spelling mistakes! I really tried but I am not a native English speaker.   Edit: also sorry that this is so long!

I already managed to get A*BB last year, but between my own hubris and the pressure that comes with being known as the 'smart kid' for my entire life, I didn't want to settle for the only uni that would take me and chose to take a year out and try for Cambridge.  *  It's taken 3 months to get a referral to a mental health professional for an assessment, and I will not get a phone call from said professional until the 19th.  *  My super religious mother confiscated my medication about two months ago and said I should be praying more and that my depression comes from not paying enough attention in church. I'm 19, not at uni (doing retakes in this gap year) and unemployed apart from volunteering; she's paying for all my tuition costs (About £3k) so I'm totally financially dependent on her.  *  Now my depression and anxiety is untreated and has gotten significantly worse, and I'm not even sure I'll make it until the 19th. I find it impossible to focus on studying and completing coursework, and I can see myself failing again. I need to get at least an A* and an A this year to get into my dream uni, but I'm not sure I'll even be able to cope once I get there.

On paper this is the perfect solution for me since I find the tedium and routine of paid employment crashing.   I got my first contract and I made many tiny errors even with the preliminary work I shared with them. Errors they caught and made clear were unacceptable. Well, i started paying closer attention which considerably slowed me down. Add to that that my distractbility went into overdrive last few days and my speed slowed to a crawl. I sought extensions which they reluctantly gave. Missed those new deadlines and have now lost a job. Two weeks wasted. Broke as hell too. I feel worthless.  **TLDR: Freelance work. Cautioned for making easy errors. Slowed down to catch errors. Lost job. Wasted two weeks of life. Enthusiasm for work fading AGAIN. 30 something year old who cant get adulthood right. Feel like shit.**

Just curious at the differences between people.;;;I'm a 23 y/p female that was recently diagnosed and started taking Adderall XR (generic) and I know everybody is different, but I'm up to 20 mg and don't feel a thing. There's still a song stuck in my head at all times and two conversations going on and I'm typing this instead of doing my job, forgetful, classic ADHD symptoms, etc. I also don't have the side effects like nausea and decreased appetite either. My friend who has had it since he was a kid says he almost doesn't believe that I don't feel anything, but honestly I don't. Maybe it's because it's XR and not IR? Just curious to see what kind of trouble you guys had to go through to figure out what worked, and what combination it was that you finally found.

I have been thinking about what went differently in the past, and brainstorming ideas for new things to try.   I believe a crucial element to success is working with other people. I do my best work when I am surrounded by other people who are working, such as in a library, or gathering with other job-hunting friends.   But that's not enough this time; I need to do something fundamentally different from (or in addition to) what I have been doing.  I am looking to expand this social accountability system, and connect specifically with other people with ADHD.  Who else would like to partake in this?   *I am imagining that the group could do things like hold a weekly competition for whoever submits the most number of applications, etc., and finds a way to reward that person.   *Another idea would be to have a "skirmish," modeled after the skirmishes seem on FAWM.org (February album writing month). A date and time is set in advance, then one person gives everyone else a song title at the appointed time, and everyone has one hour to write and post their song. What if we did something like that (but gave it more time), and make it focused on themes like a cover letter, for example?  *I also know how it feels to be stuck or overwhelmed when tasked to write about yourself, so perhaps we could help each other with that too - For example, I have an easier time with it if I speak out loud with someone about my qualifications first.  Please let me know if you're interested, and/or have any ideas for how to refine this idea. Thanks.  **TL;DR: Looking for other people with ADHD who are job-hunting to form an online group.**

My grades were mediocre from elementary school through high school, yet I could still be the answer machine for fellow students and start---then derail into absurdity---group discussions in class. As much as I loved learning, I was just constantly bored with the homework and then just bored in general.  Again, I thought and was told that I was a lazy kid/teen.  It wasn't until I started university in my late 20s that a professor helped me discover and come to terms that I have ADHD. She said I knew the material on a passionate level, but said I would derail group conversations, often going into totally different directions. She pointed out that my essays were smart, but rambling into different---sometimes unrelated---directions. Then she said that even when I did turn in homework on time, the contents of it gave her the impression that I was bored, even though she knew I was never bored on the subject (Anthropology--Primates). Then came her diagnosis, after the detailing of her having studied my behavior over the course of the semester, that I have ADHD.  I always thought (and was told) that it was a made-up mental ailment for "lazy people". I should also note that I have suffered severe depression most of my life and survived a few suicide attempts. I have always felt worthless.   Needless to say that due to my extreme unshakable respect for my professor, I took her revealings seriously and began looking more into ADHD.   I'd like to say that GI Joe was right and that knowing IS half the battle, and maybe it still is, but this knowing unveiled new horrors. I felt trapped, a prisoner of ill-sated and mentally drowsy passion. Shackled.   I loved my classes, almost in a poetically romantic way. I simply adored and practically worshiped my professors. You could ask anyone of my friends that I hung out with on a regular basis and they would tell you that sometimes I just would not shut up about my course material. On the outside, I looked like one of those overly obsessive students. Behind closed doors, with my assignments, was a blood soaked battlefield of a losing campaign.  The knowing in that it was not pure laziness erased the possibility of a placebo, which sometimes (hit or miss) would help me complete endeavors, albeit rarely. I didn't know what to do anymore and it had started to become apparent in its existence within my recreational activities. Do you know how excruciatingly painful it is to WANT to play Skyrim, but not be able to because of this mental "boredom" block that insists it would be more "fun" to sit and think about what else you could do while ultimately sitting there and doing NOTHING?! Of course you do. All of you do. That's why I have eventually found myself here. I need the support of a community.  I dropped out of university, because despite my still undying passion for the sciences, racking up student debt with mediocre to failing grades did not seem worth it and I was tired of being a complete disappointment and a waste of time to the professors---that I saw/still see as God-like---who had all the faith in me, probably more faith than most of my family and friends. It is still eating me alive.  Hello, it's nice to meet all of you. I hope we can all help each other with the burden of our mental shacklings.
e68231dacb5bc4b80e01c0fe035392c321bffac2962019451b0540706ab86427;;;Starting Vyvanse;;;I was diagnosed a year or two ago (28 now), and while the diagnoses brought me a measure of vindication/relief, I haven't had much luck on the medications my psychiatrist has prescribed so far. But I'm wondering if that's due to unrealistic expectations.  I've just started Vyvanse (taking 40 mg) and...something's different. There's a small boost to my focus on individual tasks and motivation to complete them, and even if I still get diverted easily there's a bit more resistance on some level to just careening off in new directions. But some days, like today, I feel the stimulant more than anything.  I guess I was hoping for the sort of life changing transformation some people describe with their first medication, and I'm worried I may have dismissed some of the other meds too quickly when I didn't get those results. I'm trying to be mindful now and work with the Vyvanse, rather than expecting it to do all the work.
48b90259e02b9142b8aecaebb7005f4e685fa8e80df35ad9d34bb1a6e0a82fd3;;;Sitting "oddly" helping focus?;;;Hi there, all! I'm a university student, and I've noticed that the quality of my focus on my homework really increases when I'm sitting in positions people would consider weird... even now that I'm 22. Sorry if this is a silly question, but I'm just curious.   Examples would be sitting cross-legged like you would if you were sitting on the floor, or with one leg propped up on the seat and resting your chin on it, or having one leg tucked under yourself so you're basically sitting on your foot.  I've been doing this since I was a child, and I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was about 5 years old. I try not to do it in public, but sometimes I'll stop caring if I'm under a lot of stress and *really* need to focus and get my work done at some place like the library.   I know that this is mostly associated with other kinds of disorders like ones on the autism spectrum, but I also know that stimming, or stim-like motions are used by people with ADHD too, but more for focusing and getting that need for movement out of our system moreso than for self-soothing in potentially stressful situations or to handle intense emotions. I've been tested for autism before when I was a kid, but I didn't have behaviors outside of some of the shared ones between ADHD and autism spectrum disorders consistent enough with the criteria to get any sort of diagnosis of, so I'm pretty sure that isn't a factor.  So I was wondering if maybe this was something other people with ADHD experience as being helpful and see if people have any thoughts as to why this might be if they do... or if this is just a thing I do that a lot of people would see as odd and is probably unrelated to me having ADHD.
bbb0dce3acdc44778f28cab4aaf9510c0b81dca58f2d2c556a8e9ee42f1a9f4f;;;What was your first two weeks on Strattera like?;;;I'm 39, I was diagnosed about a year and a half ago. Adderall made me feel like a zombie and Ritalin gives me palpitations and anxiety.   I have a slight heart murmur and I suffer from bad anxiety and ocd, I have a constant fear of dying while I'm on the stimulants.   I was a bit depressed because my adhd put me in a bad position business wise and I racked up a lot of debt.  I started the Strattera  and it kind of cheered me up the first week was good but it hurt when I ejaculated.   It calmed down my anxiety and helped with my depression a bit though. I'm on day 12 and my anxiety has really kicked up, I increased the dose on the 7th day from 40mg to 80mg. I feel wired with no focus and I'm getting palpitations.    I just feel really weird and shitty on this stuff, like it's not doing anything for my adhd . I asked the doctor for Vyvanse but he told me it's like adderrall and would feel the same way.    I'm thinking about giving up on meds all together, which sucks because ADHD is really fucking up my life.
2a6cf8e81a12493a85f11469f82da7a7cfeac5aa3e23236077d0b3ce44d9f632;;;Late bloomer joining the ranks with ADD;;;Good Friday afternoon everyone! Well as the title states, I am a late bloomer. I am a male of 37 years and was diagnosed in November 2015 as having ADD with a major in inattentiveness. Honestly I'm kind of proud of my diagnosis but at the same time a little frightened. It was several years ago when it was suggested that I get tested. The mother of a woman i was dating performed tests for elementary students and suggested I look into it as she felt she was seeing some symptoms in me. At that time I was in the camp that ADHD was overdiagnosed and too many kids being put on drugs for no reason. I feel bad for that opinion now. I had been in some therapy a few years later and after a test was performed it was suggested that I might be ADD. They offered me uppers or downers. I frowned upon that as I felt that they should be telling me what I needed if it were genuine. So that subsided and I just took the antidepressants they were shoveling. Fast forward a few more years and it came up again this time from my nurse practitioner. This was due what has been described as a nervous breakdown or midlife crisis. 2015 had been about my worst year on record. Hopefully it stays that way. What really drove me to get this done was a link my current GF sent to me while I was at work describing the symptoms of ADD/ADHD. I almost began crying at my desk surrounded by my peers. I was able to identify with the majority of what was listed. It was an eye opener. It kind of just made sense. It also added to my anger that all this time and potential that has been wasted because it wasn't found earlier.   Looking back the signs were there. Though 30 years ago they were often overlooked. They make sense now. 1. Teachers: He's a smart kid, he just doesnt apply himself. 2. Parents: You'd do better in school if you just remembered to turn in your homework. Why would you not turn in your homework? 3. I was told that I was advanced in school though i should have been held back all throughout elementary. I was finally held back in the 6th grade, and coasted with a C average in high school. 4. Parents always describe me as having been a bad child. My memory is different, but when i fucked up, i did so in a grand manner. 5. In adult life, I dont think I ever really listen to a conversation 100%. This is particularly hard with work as I begin forgetting the beginning of the conversation about the time we get to the middle of it and at that point the end makes no sense. I still nod and act as if I understood for fear of admitting what might appear as being stupid.  6. I dont consider myself smart, but do recognize I am intelligent. I often use the phrase "Jack of all trades but master of none". So i know a little about a lot. But never enough to be a subject matter expert. Well except for those times when 'hyperfocus' kicks in.  7.  Relationships. Thats a tough one. Heck they are tough for everybody right? I've started new methods to keep them stimulating and so far am having fun with that. I hope it persists.  Anyways, thats some of what I could come up with for myself. I am now on my second day of Vyvanse 30mg. I notice something different but cant quite put my hands on it. Yesterday was awesome as I sprung up and was ready to get shit done. I feel i crashed about 5pm. Today I feel kinda chill. Perhaps a slight buzz feeling, but nothing like yesterday.   Focus? Well I'm hoping that will come in more as I stay on the meds. So far, I have gotten a little done at work, but here I am on reddit. Well that and some youtube videos about add, and reading at sba.gov for ideas for entrepreneurship from an idea I had several months back. Though its kind of slipping away and was likely just another hair brained idea that got me super stimulated but will probably cease to exist like the others.

I realize that I need help, but everything seems like merely a struggle towards the inevitable.    I failed to get documentation to two missed tests. I don't want to have to retake the course but if I tough it out my GPA may be affected for my internship application.   I feel like the reason we struggle so much is because we strive to accomplish too many things. We were not below average at birth, so why are we having what seems to be the same problems? I believe my conditions were manageable when I had clear goals and wants. Perhaps the cause for inadequacy is because we fail to see how doing X would truly make us happier.
065c52000dee20fa4c504eb7a0ddb3655aa43d35103a4be2fbfeaf2692fef968;;;FINALLY. Waiting for my assessment date. :);;;I've been moping around here for a while and finally have some positive development to share. I spoke to the person in charge of processing referrals and they told me that I had just been diagnosed with autism and symptoms often get confused.  I firmly told them that the ADHD symptoms I described to my GP are the symptoms that most cause me trouble and she will not prescribe me medication until I have an assessment (she referred me for diagnosis). He agreed to send an email to the secretary of the department who will diagnose me and told me to wait for my appointment letter in the mail.  The consultant who I was referred to is retiring in April and so it is very likely I will see somebody else. Which makes me slightly sad, but I imagine his replacement will be equally specialised in the same fields.   I should note I am located in the UK and I actually just figured out why they raised the concern about already having recently been diagnosed Dx Having two referrals quite close together is probably quite costly for the NHS, the Asperger's assessment is already worth between £1000-£3000...
fad83ae20fd5faea1e951af72b670130bd0bbd09a91a37dd0214ac3ffb04c4cf;;;[Methylphenidate] - Fast up, fast down on controlled release capsule;;;Hi, I'm an 22 year old male. I got diagnosed with ADHD without hyper activity little over two weeks ago after seven years of wondering why I could never hold my focus and study like everyone else. I was always told I am smart, but lazy.   I was put on a controlled release version of methylphenidate with 17,5 mg of active ingredient bound to slowly dissolving starch balls that are supposed to release the drug over the span of eight hours into my system.   Me and my psychiatrist agreed that I start with one capsule in the first few days and see if I get any noticeable effect. If I don't get any noticeable reaction I can up the dose to one in the morning and a second one in the afternoon with lunch and possibly a third one as late as 6 pm.   The only effect I'm getting from the morning dose is slight vertigo and a feeling like "something is going to happen in a moment, but I don't know what it is". I don't get any noticeable enhancement with concentration. This could be because I am still really tired in the morning and the drug doesn't seem to have much effect on making me feel awake. This feeling fades away relatively quickly and I am left feeling empty and tired.   Then when I take the second capsule after 4-5 hours with lunch I start to feel the effects. I feel robotic and all my urges to distract myself fade away and are replaced with a calm feeling and almost an urge to do monotonic tasks. All my bouncy, over-analyzing though processes are killed and the world goes silent. I have never been able to study for a test for longer than 30-40 minutes at a time before finding something else to do, but in this "robot mode" I can sit still for the whole duration of 3-4 hours. Then everything just crashes and I am left with an empty mind, slight anxiety (sometimes paranoia) and I get easily irritated. However, this has not happened every single time.   I feel I could benefit so much from the medication to get my urgent tasks done for once, but the sharp ups and downs are getting really annoying. I'm also consuming huge amounts of food while the drug is active and my stomach feels empty all the time even though I was told that the drug could do the exact opposite.   I've always had a super fast digestion system. I can eat and eat and never gain kg and stuff just keeps coming out the other end. Which makes me wonder could the problem be that the drug is absorbed too fast, causing all these negative side effects? To add, I'm feeling absolutely fine always in the morning before taking the drug. I also sleep at least 8 hours every single night.
e1122128c306cd8b620e2a48c96511d72cdb59ca5dc881b2803b9e75399a15e4;;;I've been living in denial.;;;So, to put this in the shortest simplest way possible. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was about 7-8 years old. For some reason I was in denial about it, and when I was 14 I stopped taking my medication (I was prescribed Ritalin.) My happiness with my own life improved dramatically, but my grades dropped. I maintained a D+ - C- average my highschool life, but I could not possibly care any less about it. I graduated when I was 18, and decided that my grades were part of a motivational problem. So I decided I wanted to go to college, but not until I have the motivation to actually try... Up until a few months ago when I had a very intense experience with psychedelic drugs (If you look at my history, you'll notice I post a lot in r/LSD) and realized I'm now 21 years old, and I've living in denial of my diagnosis. I think it might have something to do with being afraid of people thinking I'm weird or a freak, but people who don't know I have ADHD think I'm a weirdo and a freak, so what the hell am I doing?  So I came here. To this subreddit. I don't know what I expected to come of it, but I remember seeing on the front page people talking about problems I've been dealing with for as long as I remember. Such as having an awful habit of needing two monitors with two different things happening to actually feel stimulated, or checking the make sure I actually locked my car 3-4 times, or my complete lack of impulse control, or all of the difficulties I have sleeping.  It felt like huge weight off of my shoulders, for two reasons. First of all, knowing that a lot of my strange quirks and hard to explain problems can be traced back to this disorder. It felt like I was finally armed with some kind of knowledge I could use. I had proved to myself that over the years that pretending I was born perfect is clearly not working for me, if I have some sort of disadvantage, I need to learn how to work with it, or if I'm lucky, learn how to use it to my ability. Secondly, because for the first time in a really, really long time. I don't feel alone. Knowing there's currently 45,829 people subscribed to this subreddit who have probably already posted about something I'm having trouble with, and have already come up with several solutions on how to handle them.  This is the only time I've really been able to post here, because everything I've wanted to ask or say, has already been said or asked. So I just wanted to say thank you all for indirectly helping me so much simply by coming together and not being afraid to be who you are.  TL;DR Thank you, for being you, r/ADHD  Love, alltornsuits

For a bit a of a back story, it's always been obvious that I've suffered from ADHD, and I've been "tested" and diagnosed twice now, but somehow I just stopped renewing my Adderall prescription, and moved away from home, so I can't go back to the doctor that prescribed me in the first place. I have recently gotten a new doctor close to my university though, and I had all my past information transfered to him, but it was super obvious that he was very skeptical of everything I was telling him in regards to my symptoms.   So for a while now, I've attempted to just deal with it, trying every "natural" remedy on the market, but it's gotten to the point where nothing works, and a combination of the ADHD and the anxiety it causes has taken over my life. I'm unable to study, put off assignments until literally the last minute, zone out in the middle of lectures and even regular conversations. It's killing my social life and my education.  Back to the original question then, how can I possibly get help for this, and get the only thing that's made me feel remotely close to "normal" for as long as I can remember without seeming like I'm fishing for "study drugs?"   Thank you in advance, and sorry for the essay.

So for like tests and stuff I absolutely can concentrate. It's incredibly fucking difficult and I have to take a break to daydream halfway through every time but I can do it. The problem is how fucking much fucking effort it is. It takes EVERY little bit of willpower I have to do and afterwards I actually usually pass out.  All throughout my GCSE's (final high school exams) I would skip lessons to take naps behind the drama stage after exams afterwards I would literally feel so fucking exhausted like I'd been up for days.  Since I started college I've spent so much time putting effort into studying and homework (it takes me 3-4 hours to do something it takes classmates 1 hour) that I nap for an hour when I get home and sleep for 9 hours a night otherwise I'm exhausted all the time (also severe depression and anxiety but that comes with it).  Anyone else feel like this? Oh yeah I'm unmedicated, been diagnosed multiple times by different doctors since I was six.  TL;DR Anyone able to concentrate if they expend all their willpower and feel fucking exhausted for doing so?

"You better f**in watch yourself because you are on speed, I know people Who take drugs and youre just one of those".  I really dont know what else to say. I had been putting up with his offhand remarks and disrespect for years. I stumbled home and broke down in tears. Why did i even bother coming back To say goodbye to these people before i left? No one bothered defending me. I was left pleading despite my hurts for him to not drink and drive home. I had hit my limit. I forgave him, but this was the end.  Im sorry for such a depressing post. But this is the reality i face. Who ever said having adhd and being stigmatized was easy? I figured i deserved better. And maybe many of you out there do Too. I leave this country in a few days.

dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Unusual ADD Assessment?;;;Upon my most recent visit to my GP (through Kaiser) I mentioned to him that I have had ADD symptoms throughout my entire life, and I would like to finally get it diagnosed (due to the fact that I'm now going into college  and life is getting more serious and it's been affecting me now more than ever)  He gave me a phone number to call to set an "ADD Assessment". Upon speaking on the phone with them, they said that I could go in next Thursday, and that it's group assessment. Supposedly I am getting examined along with other multiple people at the same time. Is this normal??? To be honest it kind of makes me uncomfortable...  UPDATE: I forgot to mention that she said it will be 1-1.5 hours long.
98ec584a28b3e20ce43a3a706255cd953a2adf3ac5b69251a5f7dbb34ef7843b;;;How do I ask a doctor for a psychological exam without looking like I want adderall?;;;Long story short. I got together with a friend to study for an exam. After three hours, he said that I really lack concentration and that he was like me before he was diagnosed with ADHD (or ADD, I don't know what he said, I guess I wasn't paying attention ironically). So he gave me adderall and I have never experienced such a productive stint of eight hours.  So for the last semester, I kept taking adderall maybe one 25mg (or was it 20mg?) pill per week, roughly. I'm usually a 3.4 GPA student, but my GPA last semester was 3.85, and the classes were significantly harder than the ones I previously had.  This semester I stopped taking adderall because I didn't really think I have ADHD and I thought taking adderall to study was like taking molly to party - it helps, but it's not necessary if you really get to it.  Now I'm here sitting, I manage to do roughly 5 exercises per day and I lack absolutely any attention or concentration that school requires.  But I digress. I suspect I have ADHD but I am not sure. I want to get a psychological exam done. I do not want to appear like I'm going to the doctor to get adderall or to appear like I just want to psychological exam to fake ADHD and get drugs. I feel like I have a genuine problem.  How can I ask my doctor for a psychological exam without appearing like a drug fiend trying to get adderall?   Frankly, I don't care about the drugs. I want to fix my problem, and that's it. They can prescribe me any obscure attention helping drug, I wouldn't care as long as it helps me get stuff done.

I've had depression in the past as a young adult. Since then I've had general anxiety issues.  I feel like a lot of the depression symptoms have gone over time.. One thing I've noticed that has crept up over the last few years is I've become more anxious about tasks that need to be performed.  It's been hard for me to plan and execute things.. I feel like I have ideas and things I want to do that I see as a priority but they somehow get "lost" in all the other things.  When I have to prioritize and make decisions, I freeze up.. the anxiety manifests itself in anger..  When i'm overwhelmed with tasks at work, it gets to the point where it's like in the movies when you get that ringing in the ears and people are talking to you but you're in a fog and can't hear them anymore and your brain wants to shut down.  It also get extremely exhausted thinking about all the tasks that need to be done.  When my wife talks about stuff that "needs to be done around the house" or "how much we need to clean", the anxiety comes out as anger.   My memory is shot.. It's hard for me to remember dates and anything prior to yesterday.    I plan on talking to a professional about this, but wanted to get your takes on it in the interim.

82fc9aca8fc8aacab918463b66d98dfe855edc8b21b91334bd6071c219f3b3a7;;;My parents never told my school I have ADHD, so i never got the help i desperately needed.;;;I have been on Medication since the 8th grade. I am currently a Senior in High School. I have always had problems with finishing classwork. I have failed a math class and 2 spanish classes in my 4 years in high school. I tried to do homework, but I would either forget or not remember what I was tought that day. I constantly zone out in class no matter how hard I try, at one point I was taking so much Adderall, I was losing weight due to the side-effect of loss of appetite.   I recently read my school handbook, and It was stated that "all students with learning disabilities will be given extra help or class time if needed." Of course I never got any of that. All my teachers probably just thought I was a lazy bastard who sat around with a blank stare all day. When I asked my Ignorant parents about it, they said that they never told the school because they thought the school would put me in class with "Special Ed".   At this point i fucking Lost it. I told my mom (Who is a religious nutjob) That she will never understand what it's like. You know what her response was? "Maybe you should stop listening to the devil telling you to stop focusing."   I am beyond livid right now. If my ignorant parents would have told the school 5 years ago, I feel like I wouldn't be put in a situation where I am barely passing High School, and facing 4 years of community college. All i needed was that little bit of help, but I never got it.
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;ADHD Diagnosis Question;;;Soon I am going to get diagnosed by a psychiatrist on whether I have ADD or not. If the psychiatrist asks me whether I have used/abused any drugs in the past, should I tell the truth or just blow it off?   I have never abused any drugs, yet I have used some, primarily being Cannabis. That being said, I haven't smoked or drank since last year, only because I haven't had any desire to and I have been more focused on other things.   My only worry is that by mentioning any drugs I have used in the past, perhaps he/she would be more reluctant to prescribe me medication.
a0d1e6c40a07ec32da7ec5406c3699902b1cd029f02b97630769961dd86040e2;;;Been Prescribed Dexedrine – Starting Meds for First Time (NERVOUS!);;;I saw a psychiatrist for the first time yesterday, and I was prescribed short-acting Dexedrine (dexamphetamine). He told me he is starting me at 5 mg which is a dose he typically never prescribes cause “I'm so petite” (I'm 24 / F).   He came up with a medication schedule for me which starts with a half a tablet today, and another half tablet tomorrow morning, and another at noon. On Sunday, I'm taking half a tablet, 3 times a day. On Monday, I'm taking a full tablet in the morning, half at noon and evening, and so on.  I find it ironic this psychiatrist is a fast talker which is a bit hard for someone with ADHD to keep up with--but he handed me a pamphlet for Vyvanse which confused me. Is Dexedrine and Vyvanse the same medication then? (From my internet search, they're different meds).  He did mention if Dexedrine works for me, he will switch to long-acting, BUT this medication will only help with focus and attention regulation – But not issues with executive function which includes procrastination, motivation, decision making etc. He said he will add something later on to the regime in the next few weeks. I thought this was interesting, however he didn't mention which medication he's thinking of.   Today I took half of a 5 mg tablet about 2 hrs and a half ago. I don't feel anything, and I'm not really surprised since it's such a low dose (2.5 mg from half the tablet).  Since it has been awhile since my last meal, I felt a bit light headed so I'm eating a full meal now. I may be a petite girl, but I LIKE food and NEED to eat 3 meals a day. I don't want this to be my last meal before side effects kick in and I never want to eat...  My main concerns regarding side effects with stimulants are: loss of appetite, weight loss, heart racing, increased anxiety, any sort of mental/mood disturbances and change, and changes in libido and sexual side effects.  Are these side effects unavoidable? Is it inevitable I will experience them, or will it vary from person to person?  I find it interesting that it says to NOT take this medication if you have anxiety, tension. etc Should I expect my anxiety to worsen as I take more of this medication over time? This psychiatrist knows I have been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder – but he is prescribing me to it anyway, and I want to trust his professional judgment (but I haven't been having great experiences with doctors lately).  I don't know, I'm just very nervous about taking medication. I put off antidepressants from my family doctor pushing them on me for the past year.  Anyone have any experience with Dexedrine and how it worked for them?

"Well, we all procrastinate."  "Man, you're lucky. I wish I had extensions/a note taker/Adderall."  And then I saw this fucking meme that said, "I used to have ADHD too. I healed when I saw my dad taking off his belt."
aaffe2c1aab22e1a5388820d87daa6a129b379000c49eaa3ec4babe01bb3e63d;;;ADHD medication: Dexamphetamine, Ritalin, or Concerta? (AUS);;;Last week I went to see a psychiatrist to talk about my lifelong ADHD symptoms, and next session he'll basically be diagnosing my subtype (which based on the DIVA 2.0 he gave me to fill out at home, pretty certain I fall under primarily inattentive) and starting me on a medication plan. He gave me a sheet listing four different medications that he prefers to prescribe: * Dexamphetamine * Vyvanse * Ritalin * Concerta  I pretty much crossed Vyvanse off my list though because in Australia you can only get it at a reasonable price ($30 a month) if you were diagnosed at the age of 18 or prior, so it would wind up costing me $113 a month (which sucks because my brother is on Vyvanse and it's really helped him). Whereas I can get a reduced price on the others.   I'm leaning towards Concerta given it is extended-release, especially because I'm a full-time Uni student and have a lot of work to get through, but my boyfriend has been on Ritalin since he was 6 and found that to be really useful, although I've heard it can be rather "punchy".   I know that everyone's experiences differ and sometimes you need to try a few before getting onto the medication that is right for you, but regardless I would like to get a feel for what might be best suited to me prior to beginning my treatment.   **So, what are people's positive/negative experiences with Dexamphetamine, Ritalin, and/or Concerta? You can also tell me about other medications that you've found really useful, given I don't *need* to stick to the meds he prefers to prescribe**

Now that I'm turning 33, it's safe to say this disorder is my version of normal.   I stopped taking Adderall after high school and while I miss being able to focus and get work done, I don't miss the way it made me feel.   Now that you have a bit of back story, I'm wondering if anyone else has the same problems I do. For the past year or more, I have felt like I'm losing my mind. I can't remember anything, and it's not your typical, I can't remember the answers to this test I studied for.  Last week, I needed to call my boss, but had to scroll through my phone contacts because I couldn't remember her name. Just yesterday, I was trying to tell someone about the new trailer for Civil War, but I couldn't remember the name of the movie.   This happens all the time, and it seems to be getting worse. I'm experiencing panic attacks on a weekly basis over trivial things that I'm forgetting. I'm afraid to talk to anyone about this, because I don't want to admit I may have a serious problem. I'm hoping this is something that others with ADHD experience, but I'm not sure.

Need some help finding a med that doesn't make me feel like I'm going to explode.;;;**Diagnosis:**   ADHD at age 13, no medication. Medication started at age 28, after being re-diagnosed with the [Quotient Test](http://www.additudemag.com/adhd/article/8454.html). I ended up falling into the &lt;1 percentile, in almost everything, which means that my ADHD was, and remains, atrocious.  **Medication:**  1. Tried Adderall and Adderall XR and a combo of both. Made my symptoms better per Quotient test, but left me jittery as fuck.   2. Tried Vyvanse. Started at 20mg, ended at 90mg. Only side effect was a dry mouth. Quotient test proved that 90mg did NOTHING, so back to Adderall.  3. Still hated Adderall. Put on Concerta.  4. First hour or two on Concerta I feel like I'm going to have a heart attack. It's bad. Really bad. Like... I'm afraid my heart will jump out of my chest bad. After that initial scary bit, I am able to concentrate for the majority of the day.... However, once it hits 4:00 or so, I'm ready for a nap. (Luckily, I'm a substitute teacher by trade, so I am done for the day by then.)  **TL;DR of Above:**  Adderall, Concerta work for me but I feel jittery and want to explode. The Vyvanse, she does NOTHING.   **Requestion:**  (I accidentally wrote the above and I like it, so it's staying.)   Now I'm wondering, is there anything I can do to make my life better? Is there a medication that won't make me feel like my heart is going to come out of my chest or my teeth will tap themselves to death?   **Final Thoughts**  I recently told my therapist that my ADHD without meds is like... a jar stuffed full of cotton balls, with the lid forcing it closed. Every thought is pressing, and trying to get out, and trying to take out one cotton ball is impossible because they all explode out whenever you try to do so.   Living off meds is tough for my brain.  Living on meds is tough for my body.  I just want to feel better.  Help?

Next appointment is a few weeks away and it's playing on my mind a lot. Just looking to vent a bit really.

fc74bc3492a51cb90508afff5ca02afefd0a6b55e8f55f3c351d71c8a58c9aa6;;;Things that have helped me explain ADHD to the ignorant, misinformed, or misunderstood positively and with substantial success...;;;I originally had this posted under a different thread in response to a comment however had a few messages that said I might want to repost for others to see as it was helpful.   A few things that have helped me explain to some who don't understand but actually want to or are curious enough about it include:  The cocktail effect - psychologist describe the cocktail effect in an effort to explain how the brain can subconsciously filter out relevant from irrelevant stimulus. For instance, when somebody goes to a cocktail party, even in the midst of all the noise, the clinking glasses, people talking, music playing, and almost insurmountable number of audible and visual distractions, somebody from across the room at a audible level not much louder and sometimes even quieter than the rest of the noise going on calls out your name, and amidst all of that somehow you still hear them and your attention and has been grabbed! This is because the brain is constantly filtering out relevant from irrelevant stimulus subconsciously and alerting your conscious self when something requires your attention. Now imagine that every noise, every single glass clink, every word spoken, every bump into a table, every lyric to a song, your brain deciphers, sometimes more strongly than others, everyone of those things is saying hey "insert their name here"!   Secondly ADHD is described as a disorder of impulsivity amongst many other things. It's one thing to be constantly distracted and pulled away from what you're doing, however those who have ADHD don't have the same ability cognitively to return to the task that they were originally involved in. It is often something that is simply outside of our control at times. This is important to understand as simply a lack of attention span or having trouble concentrating does not simply constitute for ADD or ADHD, but it is the fact that once distracted you don't go back to what you were originally doing regardless of whether you're conscious of the fact that you're doing that or not. People with ADHD tend to live in the now and struggle with understanding and being motivated by goals and consequences, and for this reason is often perceived as a behavioral problem.   Third, and often not discussed or understood fully but very very very well-documented is ADHD's affect regarding emotions and the impulsivity that can swirl around them. We simply tend to react impulsively, wearing our emotions on her sleeve's, and before we realize that "hey buddy, were commin in hot here..."  the damage has often already been done. Where as other people would normally never act out those things and me feel those emotions in the moment but quickly pass and don't really have much of a regard for their true feelings as logic and reason tend to catch up fairly quickly, we're just along for the ride.   Lastly, when it comes to hyperactivity, hyperactivity is normally scene when you're very young as a child, sometimes as early as in the womb, but often starting to see symptoms around The ages between five and eight, and often peeking in the early to mid teens. When were considering the H in ADHD, it's really referring more to an internal hyperactivity. Although we may not look at on the outside, on the inside we are bouncing around like a handful of superballs in a dryer.   I love analogies. If you approach somebody who makes a comment or asks a question and ignorance with the understanding that they're probably saying this simply because they just don't know any better, it helps tame some of our impulsive reactions to it and allows us to teach any fun constructive manner. And this is where the magic happens. This is where people become interested and engaged. People tend to make jokes when they're uncomfortable. But if you're open with them and show them that there's no reason to be uncomfortable and you're more than happy to explain it not only for their benefit but for your own as well, this is where you can make new friends while in turn educating them and inevitably those around them. In fact there is been a few occasions where upon explaining this and giving them knowledge in a more digestible format, the person I was talking to you had a holy shit moment and realized that they in fact might have something that they didn't believe they ever did to begin with.   As you can see by my original post, impulsive emotions still come out, however if you change your own mindset you can curve those impulses to be positive or constructive. It just takes a lot of extra work for us because instead of simply acting the part or doing steps A, B, and C, we have to radically change the way we think, the things we believe, and in turn, the impulses better reflect those internal presumptions.   Hope this helps!  TLDR: Analogies are the shit!

Last year I decided to make an experience abroad because I've found this occasion after my graduation when I was still looking for a job in my country. It can be said that this was for me the first real experience abroad and most of all away from my parents. The first months were really tough because of my lack of practice in the use of the english language, but I tried to stay committed and I started to stick with a plan that I devised on purpose in order to overcome this weakness. It wasn't easy, I started to read a lot of books in english language and day by day I managed to improve my abilities. However, I realized that I have struggled a lot in order to maintain my concentration on a single book, in fact instead of being a pleasant activity has been really perceived as a duty that has to be done. This gave rise also to a series of issues like depression and anxiety that weren't allowing me to sleep a proper amount of time, and being able to be functional especially in social contexts. I should say that I wasn't a social animal also when I was in my country, However that was something that wasn't concerning me that far. In the workplace I felt always really frustrated not only because of the linguistic gap, but also because people around me were able to handle all the tasks in an easier way than mine. Up until now I didn't manage to have an assessment for ADHD, but I guess that I should actively looking for it because it's something that is keeping me down the more the time is passing by. The question is: How did you discover that you were dealing with ADD/ADHD?
bb41dc5a7ec91c0a24a332a9954775486ac905ec8fdf18125d2ba88e61125007;;;How I know Strattera works for me;;;Back when I was unmedicated, sometimes I found it hard to tell how bad my symptoms were, because I had no frame of reference to how neurotypical people experience things within their own brain. Also, with drugs like strattera, progress takes place over such a long period of time that it's hard to notice that things are getting better.  I had a "lightbulb" moment in the car this morning about just how much progress I have made. Let me tell you what my morning was like.  ~8:00 woke up (I usually wake up at like 6:30am for work, so this is a good amount of sleeping in for me) made some toast, took meds, got back in bed and surf the internet.  ~9:00 parents wake up. I let them take over in the bathroom because they have somewhere to go. Spend some quality bonding time with my cat. start thinking about what I need to do today.  ~10:00 get up. shower, dress. Separate laundry.  ~11:00 Put a load of laundry in, leave for Costco. I have a written list of things I need to get, but I am also able to keep a mental list. my brain used to be like a sieve when it came to remembering shopping/to do lists. I get to costco and didnt forget anything at home (like my card, wallet, or house keys.)  ~12:30 Go Home. On the way, start thinking about what I want for lunch at work next week, and what ingredients I need to buy at the grocery store tomorrow and what I already have in the house.  Put cold food away. switch laundry. Now i'm sitting here writing this.  Before it would have taken me until 4pm to actually leave the house.  Idk. this is just a small snapshot of my life, but i never thought life could be this easy

Diagnosed as kid a couple times, but parents didn't believe in it / didn't want me on drugs. Have anxiety, social issues and memory problems most of my life. It comes and goes from time to time though in severity, but a lot of times I feel like I'm not really paying attention to my own life.  I've been off and on anxiety medication throughout my life due to poop related issues when I get anxious, but they only help that particular symptom. Getting to the conversation with my doctor to get anxiety meds was incredibly difficult for me. I'm the type of guy who is afraid to ask for any of the "fun" drugs because of judgement.  Lately I've been experiencing super fuzzy days where I feel like I'm completely disconnected. I've been trying to learn some front end stack coding and it seems to get really bad once I start getting deep into it.  So, how do I start? Do I go to a therapist or a doctor? I haven't been to my GP in years, I'm kinda bad about going to doctors/dentists and so on because it acknowledges something is wrong, if that makes sense.  When I bring it up, will my doctor be able to look up any past diagnoses and will that help?  The only time I ever really brought it up after my family doc who did my young diagnoses, the doctor was immediately dismissive (I stopped going to him later for similar reasons, but it kinda left me with this uneasy feeling towards bringing it up, which seems pretty common based on my reading)  Thanks and sorry for the text wall.

Help!;;;I haven't been diagnosed with ADHD, but I'm pretty sure (even though everyone thinks they have ADHD nowadays) I have it. I'm going to a mental health clinic soon.   My Mom is depressed over the fact that I'm turning out to be a loser rather than a success/hard worker. I just sit on my computer all day. She used to be sad over the fact that I dropped out of college. Now that I've got a job lined up for 5 months from now, she's sad over the fact that I sit on my computer all day (tv, videogames, google, etc.) , and I don't help around the house. I also don't currently bring in any money. I'm supposed to do the tax return, but I've been taking months to do it. I rarely do chores.   I've been trying to get over whatever this ADHD-like thing is on my own, but I can't. I've been trying for years.   It's hard for me to talk about ADHD with her. I got sort of obsessed with it. She doesn't fully believe in ADHD. If she did, she wouldn't believe that I have it. She think I'm lazy or spoiled. Hell, I'm having trouble believing I might have it. It feels like cheating to give the blame to something other than myself.  Is there any way I can help her before I visit a shrink? Can I convince her to be happy even though I am having trouble? Thanks. :)

I have so far lived an empty and lonely life without accomplishments, filled with self-hatred, cynicism and negativity. At this point I feel that’s what I am destined to be, a bitter &amp; lonely man who will never amount to anything. I wish I could be positive and happy but when your life has only consisted of failures it seems logical that you become bitter, maybe it’s just a bad excuse. I have never been able to finish things I started. For the second time I’m about to flunk out of university. I spend most my days procrastinating and playing video games as a form of escapism.

While they have girlfriends, apartments/houses and well-paying jobs I’m stuck in a downward spiral, having to struggle for rent and food.  It’s not like I’m contemplating suicide, I just wish I could see the light at the end of the tunnel. At the moment everything feels hopeless and every attempt I make seems futile and the motivation to even try is long gone. I don’t really know where I’m going with all this. I guess it just feels good to write my thoughts down.

Towards the end of high school i didnt like that i had to rely on my medication so i stopped , but after my grades dropped drastically i started to take them again for my final exams and managed to get a decent pass and make it into university.   Now im in university and im at the point where if i dont take my medication i know that if i dont start taking my medication regularly im going to fail my course but i dont like that i have to rely on the medication to make me 'normal'. As it stands right now its 4:30pm on the day before i have my part for 2 of my assignments due and i havent started any of them because ive procrastinated all week. So this is something that i know if i dont get on regular medication soon im not going to accomplish anything in my adult life once im in the 'real world'. Ive tried researching alternative methods and tips on dealing with it, but i just cant see how breathing techniques or checklists are effective when ive tried and failed.  tl;dr i guess my question is how do overcome this and get my life on track. I need to get better but i feel like i cant surpass this by myself without the medication, and even then i feel its barely enough.  EDIT: thanks for the advice guys, if i dont end up overcoming this soon ill probably go back on meds like you all suggested. however for the mean time ill see if i can make it without

Dr. Barkley is just amazing. He explains adhd with a passion that helps others get a very small taste of what we go through every goddamn day. And, every one of his videos brings me to tears and makes me laugh because he truly understands what I have gone through and what i am currently going through. I wish the world was filled with more people like him.   If you ever read this Dr Barkley, thank you so much for the work you have done. You can not imagine what this means to me, to us.
3f3a7623ca46af215df12aec63594d41b1c1aade1cd9863ed9445a6cc60725fc;;;I'm okay now but everyone else around me isn't. (Basically, how do you deal with over sympathising with people who you know are going through what you've been through);;;I'm in my second year of university. I went through the ringer last year (getting here, not being able to grasp the work as quickly as I used to, no discipline then depression came along because of my constant failings no matter what I did)  but then I got help, I went to a psychiatrist, got diagnosed and on medication. I started meditating, making friends, going to lectures and working again.  I still have issues hyper focus when studying/writing tests so I miss out on important details and under perform and I have developed huge avoidance issues as coping mechanism of what happened last year (Currently not doing my huge computer science assignment that is due on Tuesday).  But I'm fine, my medication isn't a miracle drug and does have downsides but I force myself to get out of bed and go about having a day, even if I don't get work done, I force myself to do something (non-zero days but not really).  BUT the thing is, it seems that all my friends have suddenly started acting the same way I did before I got diagnosed. (I know they don't all have ADHD) and they all love coming to me about it because I'm understanding and give good advice because i've been through shit and I'm still the funny, happy one. It's extremely touching to know that i'm the person they think of when they're feeling down but fuck it's a lot of weight to carry.  No-one has specifically told me anything but I know where it's going. It's hard to know the dark places they're going to end up even though you try and stop it (I spend hours hanging out with them and pep talking them).  I want to help them and be a good friend (Also largely because I wish I had that) but I can tell, I can fucking tell that being around that much negativity is going to undo all the work I've done to better myself since last year.  Also, now i'm scared to tell my friends I have ADHD because I'm scared they immediately jump to that.  **TL;DR:** Friends are going through shit I went through, I want and try to help *a lot* but I can tell it's going to negatively impact me. Where's the balance between being a good friend to them and being a good friend to myself?

And I can't seem to focus on anything because of the anticipation.;;;TL;DR: The anticipation of potentially getting meds in a few days is getting me so excited I can't focus at work. Any tips on patience?  After several months of talking to a psychiatrist, and him confirming that it is very likely I have ADHD-PI, we were looking into medication options. But my blood pressure was too high at a measurement he took! I panicked for a while, thinking I may never be able to get help with this, but I was also pretty sure the blood pressure is due to elevated heart rate from anxiety (which is mostly ADHD induced). I bought a blood pressure monitor, measure it religiously at home morning and evening, and I am actually in the normal range unless I am stressed out or anxious (which happens often during the day, particularly in the presence of people I'm unfamiliar with). So problem solved. I should get my meds in a few days time, when I see my psychiatrist again.  The problem: that's all I can think about (barring a few things I am hyperfocusing on occasionally), and it is really affecting my performance at work. I end up staring in space and zoning out more often than not, which is bad, since I have some deadlines coming, and it's still a fairly new job that I don't want to mess up.   On the one hand, I keep imagining just how awesome it would be to be able to control what I focus on (oh the irony!), wondering what aspects of ADHD it will help with (memory? time perception? emotional regulation? impulsivity?), and fantasising about how much easier some everyday tasks may become. On the other hand, I worry that something else may pop up (psychiatrist still not convinced about blood pressure issues, or some other health issue), or that the meds may not work, or that the starting dose will be too low to help me in any way, or nasty side effects, etc etc.   My focus had been getting a bit better in the past few months, through mindfulness, exercising and a better diet, but it has been feeling worse than ever this past week.  I guess I mainly needed to rant to someone who would understand what this feels like. But any advice or tips are also welcomed!

Every time the exact same thing happens and I try to rationalize why and resolve to do things differently this time. In the past, I've had an almost charmed life in regards to this. But I have a sinking feeling my luck is about to run out.  I've been procrastinating. On a lot of important things, but primarily it's the ten page paper I have to finish in less than five days which I've done no research for in a class where I barely have a C. I can't bullshit my way out of this one, so now I have to read three full biographies in less than four days and finish a ten page paper.   I can't help but hate and loathe my own laziness and the self indulgence that led to this situation which I'm sure many of you have also experienced at one point or another. I know negative thoughts are bad for me, but I can't shut them out.   Getting this all down somewhere does help a little, but I still have this massive problem of my own making to deal with. That doesn't even take into account the presentation that's due five days later in another class I've been neglecting. And then it's finals time.   tl;dr I'm pretty fucked and it's absolutely my fault.

I started having heart palpitations once I took the 50mg so a couple days after we decided to go back down to 40mg, but after 4 days I started having palpitations once again. I feel that my dosage simply was too much with the 40mg, but my doctor decided to switch me to 30mg of Vyvance. I'm just really concerned that my focus will suffer because of the switch. Adderall seemed to really diminish my ADHD symptoms significantly and I'm just really nervous about how Vyvance will effect me.   What experiences have others had from the switch? If it doesn't work well for me should I go back and tell my doctor to lower my dose of Adderall?

Beginning was great, as usual. Setteled after a little while but still working good.  Started out with a few of the more common side effects like loss of appetite and very cold hands and feet. Also seemingly for the same reason that I get cold hands and feet my genitals shrinks visibly, like if i took a cold shower. I am also not able to get it up, even at the lowest dose that has any other noticable effect on me. If im lucky I can get it up as the med go down a bit but Its not really hard enough to do anything usefull with.... The shrinkage, stress and anxiety of loosing the erection midways makes it more or less impossible anyway. One also very unfortunate side effect of the meds is it gives me increased libido, this together with not being able to actually do anything about it makes me extremely frustrated and irritable sometimes. Most of the other sideeffects dissapeared when I hit that magic dose but not this one :/  I have no problem getting and maintaining a normal errection around 30-60minutes after the drug passes my system but by some sick perverted reason a side effect of the drug that im also experiencing is decreased libido when not taking it. Also I have various problems with sex due to my ADD (Loosing focus, anxiety, soning out etc) wich leads me to not want to engage in sex then either.  I dunno if things like viagra or stuff like that is an option or if its safe together with stimulants. Id rather not be dependent on something like that to get rid of sexual tension when I need it. Sometimes I just need to masturbate before seeing someone or going to a dinner etc so I wont be wound so tight that ill lash out because of small little things.   So, wondering if anyone out there have had simmilar problems on methylphenidate and have changed to lisdexamfetamine or dexamfetamine with success. I know this is a side effect with both drugs wich is why im uncertain if there is any point in switching. I also looked into strattera but I would imagine it would be worse in this regard seeing as its a pure norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and I am almost certain that the lack of blood flow is due to increased norepinephrine activity.  TL;DR Ritalin shrinks my dick and makes it floppy like cooked spagetti, any point in trying vyvanse or anything else or do I just have to live with it?

Currently on adderall - 20mg, instant release (i think)  first day was great, i'm now on the third day and i'm feeling weird.  my skin feels tingly and i have goosebumps a lot, i feel like i have too much energy in my chest and i need to scream or something.  i've been feeling absolutely exhausted by 2-3pm too.  right now my arms feel really weird and i'm kinda dizzy  is this kind of just something that'll go away once i get used to the medication?  i took the ACTs and it helped a lot, but just being at home it feels like too much and i don't know what to do.  my doctor that prescribed it is my primary care so i'm looking for an actual psychiatrist, but there's long wait lists.  tl;dr feeling weird on adderall and i'm not sure what to do about it
232101b85281c2b9ba8d2622690bfb0a496ff3a992b6d2eb2d10b0a7e149d5a3;;;Does how one reacts to stimulants show whether or not they have ADHD?;;;I am going to try my best to make sense. Whenever I think I might not be ADHD I think about this.   Do people who are not ADHD react to stimulant medication like people with ADHD do?  For example, I take my Adderall every day. Of course at first I had that honeymoon phase, but never felt hyped up or even stimulated really. Since its been 5 months I normally can't tell I've taken it. My appetite is fine and I'm obviously just more relaxed and not all over the place. (And my grades have improved tremendously... But that's beside the point!)  If someone who doesn't have ADHD took Adderall/Vyvanse every day for 5 months would they have the exact same effect? Does this mean I might not be ADHD just bc my doctor diagnosed me with it there really isn't a way to know for sure? I had a nurse tell me she can tell I have it because I'm more calm on stimulants but would this happen to someone who didn't have ADHD?  TLDR; does every day stimulant use have the same effect on people with and without ADHD?

Always polite, A+ in every subject, never got in trouble, etc. Got to college, everything crashed. Failed some classes, studying got way harder, below average grades, you know the drill. Ever since I've started college I've hard a really hard time concentrating in class and memorizing shit. Id read it over and over again, highlighted, made cue cards, nothing works. Got diagnosed with depression a month into my first semester(~1 and a half year ago), but refused to take any meds. Generally got better, but I still have frequent mood swings/anxiety/panic attacks/depressive episodes, more so during exam periods (like now), and I get into the cycle of (Can't concentrate -&gt; hard time studying -&gt; fail exam -&gt;depressed about being stupid and failing my exam --&gt; can't concentrate). I'm tired of this shit. I googled my "symptoms" a couple of days ago, and had a "Holy Crap" moment when reading about ADHD. The constant figiting, zoning out when someone talks to me, being disorganized, procrastination... Now I'm lucky to have very supportive parents, but when I told them I suspect I have ADHD their response was "you can't have ADHD you were an excellent student in high school" and "if you had ADHD, you wouldn't be so good at sports" ( I do LOTS of sports. Lifting, competing in martial arts, mountain biking...) Sports are pretty much the only thing I can do for hours. I can't even read a book without stopping at every page because I absolutely have no clue what I just read, or I need to move around. So this might be ADHD, or might not be, idk. But only good can come out of me seeing a doctor.
13e1751c2d5a692598b04bbae5cd62ed6beb4f89cc8147db3159d7231edc48f5;;;What does being diagnosed ADHD: Unspecified, do or not do for me vs. being given an "official" diagnosis?;;;My next appointment is a few weeks out, and I intend to ask my doctor to ELI5 when I get there. But I guess I'd like to hear from some experienced people if it "matters."  I am a 30/F who decided I needed some extra help. Had my results evaluation last week. The psych very confidently diagnosed me with GAD. He also said, "You definitely express and exhibit ADHD symptoms, but you hold down a demanding job and you say you are capable of cleaning your house. You're borderline. ADHD: Unspecified is for this kind of situation, where I'm not prepared to give you an official diagnosis." I am continuing with therapy and starting a low dose of Intuniv to try to help with both acronymns.  Came home and looked it up, and the definition of ADHD:US is pretty much exactly what he said, but I don't understand it. Seems like if you don't qualify for a diagnosis, you shouldn't need a not-quite category. But if I really do present with symptoms, what does hedging his bet do for him/me/a diagnosis? Is it an ADA thing? When I read about ADHD in women, it really resonates with me. I wonder if I accurately represented myself. Just confused I guess. Does it matter?  TL;DR diagnosed with ADHD: Unspecified, which he termed "unofficial," does having an "official" diagnosis matter any more or less going forward?

Mine are more on the financial side, but even then I feel like I might be better off without meds.  I was diagnosed about six months ago and have never been medicated.  For me, the best treatment - first and foremost - has been knowing exactly what's been going on with my brain these past 33 years.    I'd always known I was different from "normal" people.  I saw the struggles I was having keeping up with what everyone around me seemed to just naturally have a handle on... and that bothered the shit out of me.    Now, knowing what I'm dealing with, I keep this thought in mind: I'm a round peg in a square peg world.  There are things that I simply HAVE to do differently or else I'll never get them done.    We're amazing at finding shortcuts so that we have to deal with shit for the least amount of time possible.   Some people think of it as lazy, but I'm training myself to see it as being resourceful.    I'm terrible at keeping up with dishes and laundry and cleaning.  Instead of constantly trying to fight myself do tackle that huge stack of dishes that shows up in the sink every night, I downgraded and threw a lot of them/gave stuff away.  I will never again have more than three plates in the sink, because that's all I have.    Little shit like that.  It's all in your frame of mind and how you perceive your problems.  For the most part, there really isn't anything in our day to day lives that's changing, but simply the way we perceive and react to it.  The perception is the "easy" part.  The reaction, fuuuuck.     I'm still trying to get a handle on the rage fits - which have been much more sparse - because Im focusing on taking the physical triggers (tunnel vision, burning head sensation) and using them as reminds that when I start to feel this way, it's time to slow the fuck down.     Find, or make some circular holes that you fit in to naturally instead of forcing yourselves in to square ones that you could probably force yourself in to, but at what cost?

There's gonna be a little backstory here, but if you just want to get to my question it's at the bottom. I was diagnosed with ADHD by a professional around my sophomore year of high school, and took vyvanse (with relatively disappointing results) up until the end of my junior year, when I stopped completely, thinking I didn't need it. My senior year was relatively easy, but I've been struggling now that I'm in college. I'm a second semester freshman, by the way. A couple of times this semester, I've taken a 15mg adderall tablet in order to study or write an essay, and the difference has really been like night and day. The dread and procrastination I usually experience changed into a genuine joy in the intellectual activity I was undertaking. Because of this, I've been thinking I might actually benefit from a prescription, and that vyvanse may not have been the correct medication for me.          **On to my question**: If I go to a doctor seeking an adderall prescription, will I need to be re-diagnosed with ADHD, or will he or she be working off of the previous diagnosis I have from a few years ago?
0e165adfcb8fa7fefc9e79a786fcba9cf4d89c97b6f3005b2b4619ea6af45edf;;;Issues with University (Not Legal? Discrimination?) Looking For Advice &amp; Help!!;;;Hi Everyone! So I have been wanting to write on here for quite some time as I've read so many awesome posts, and I've seen a ton of really helpful advice. So now I'm hoping that some of you awesome people can give me some advice on what I should be doing to go after this as I feel like i've been getting pushed around a lot in the last two years because of my ADHD.  I know attention spans can falter so I'll put the bullet points first:  --University was scanning and grading scanned copies of all tests that used accommodations. These tests were very distinctly different because of the scan quality, so much that it was clear to see who was using accommodations in the class from across the room just from when they hand the exams back. All three exams so far for Calc have also had questionable grading where I've had to go in and meet with the professor and get the grading changed. The last exam had 10% added back to it due to "incorrect grading". I met with the Department head regarding this issue and they have now stopped this method and they tried to explain it but all their explanations have had major faults in them. The following in parentheses is what I presented the Department Head with in my meeting-- (Examinations were conducted in a manner that singled out individuals that have used accommodations by contradistinguishing those individual’s exams from all other exams. This was done so by creating unique identifying characteristics on the exam that were unique to only individuals that used accommodations. This not only created an environment in which discriminatory circumstances could have taken place during the grading of said exams, but also created discriminatory circumstances in which students with disabilities would have their status of possessing a disability publicized in an imprudent fashion.)   --Math Department fought the Disability Coordinators suggestions and my requests for accommodations. Stated last semester that the accommodations I was asking for "Fundamentally altered the course" although no evidence was given to support that. I finally got the accommodations I originally had wanted for Algebra for Calc by knowing my rights and demanding that I get them.     So the long story...  So I'm in my Senior year, less than a month away from graduation. I was diagnosed with ADHD in college and have been using accommodations for the past few years. In the past i've primarily used only the extended time on testing but when it comes to math classes I've struggled with the way the course is taught but also because of my pretty severe ADHD.   At the beginning of last semester the Disability director &amp; I met with my professor and the Assistant Department head about getting accommodations because I've taken college algebra 3 times and have been unable to pass it due to the way the course is structured. At that meeting instead of it being helpful as I was hoping, it quickly became almost hostile as the Assistant department head accused me of trying to "Fundamentally change the course". When I explained why some of these accommodations are necessary she stated that "She knows better how I learn than I do" and that I shouldn't question the methods they choose to run the course. I told her that if I wasn't able to get the accommodations to pass the course, I would elect to instead take the CLEP test to test out of the course. She scoffed at this motion eluding to the fact that if I couldn't pass Algebra 3 times I wouldn't pass the CLEP. Fast forward a few months and I took the CLEP--- &amp; I passed!   Fast forward a little bit to this semester &amp; I'm taking Calculus... And the best part is I'm doing fairly well so far! At the beginning of this semester I wasn't receiving the accommodations that I needed but because of the meeting I had with the Math Department last semester I didn't realize I could receive them. I've read up a ton on my rights and about three weeks ago I scheduled a meeting with the Assistant department in which I came prepared this time and I laid the law down and I got the accommodations I was requesting (and needed). Since having these accommodations my weekly quiz scores have went from 0's &amp; 2/10's to 9.5/10.  Following the meeting it was clear that the Assistant department head was not happy because I respectfully put her in her place in the meeting. She sent out an email to my professors and the department head that even the Disability coordinator thought was "Clearly trying to create a false characterization" of me as a student that was lazy and complaining because I wasn't doing well.  Since then I've met with the Department Head and had a very good meeting with him and he has so far been a great guy but I still feel like what I've went through has been clearly wrong and that I should pursue it otherwise it will happen to others and nothing will change.  I tried to keep this as brief as possible but I wanted to provide enough information for you to know whats sorta been going on. I would love to hear some advice or what I should do going forward as I'm new to all of this!  Thank you Guys!!  TL;DR: Math Department at University was discriminating against students with disabilities by possibly grading exams biased because of accommodations, as well as fighting accommodations in the first place.

How do you guys manage to have healthy eating habits?;;;Hey everyone! So, the title pretty much says it all. I was diagnosed with Adult ADHD a few months ago and just started taking a low dose of Vyvanse for about a week 1/2 now. It's helping quite a bit (not a miracle pill, to be sure, but I'm at least recognizing now when I'm doing incredibly absent minded things and feel like my thoughts have slowed down a bit), and I haven't really had any weird side effects, but, the eating thing is driving me nuts.  I basically forget to eat most of the day/have no appetite/when I am sorta hungry nothing is appetizing.  As a result, at night when the medication is wearing off, I find myself famished and pretty much snake-meal-ing a ton of food into my face. Then I feel gross &amp; full yet strangely still sorta hungry.   I just lost close to about 20 pounds  over the last 4 months through healthy eating habits and exercise (only 55lbs more to go until my goal weight!) and I am concerned that I'm going to now develop super unhealthy eating habits that will somehow prevent me from continuing my progress. I know thats a weird thing to say while you're on an ADHD meds since most people loose weight on them, but I haven't felt like I was pigging out on food like this for a very long time and it can't be all that good for me. On top of that, I also work a super physical job as a stage hand with a sorta weird schedule.   Tips on how to eat like a regular human would be good!

Personally, there were just a lot of things I wanted to try because they looked fun, and as a kid the only way I knew how to try things was to join a class or group for it outside of school.   As a side note I think this is part of why I didn't get diagnosed until about a month ago (I'm 23) - my life was so scheduled between school and extra-curriculars that it probably made me look like I was a high-functioning human being even though I was mostly doing everything because, well, it was scheduled, I *had* to show up, right? I never did anything in my spare time and I had absolute shit work ethic in school but I could get away with it because I had very little spare time to begin with and grade school was easy for me. University was just way too hard though; I felt like I didn't have enough time to work on assignments for the first time in my life (turns out I mostly did well in grade school because I actually had time in class to do homework, unlike in uni), so I started dropping activities, and then the number of courses I was taking per semester, but none of it helped my stress at all. The more spare time that came into my life, the more I ended up wasting all of it away, until finally I started suspecting something was actually wrong with me and started researching ADHD.  Anyways, in case anyone's curious, my current extra-curriculars are piano and accordion lessons (I've been in piano since I was 5, accordion since I was 15), accordion orchestra (yes, you read that correctly), dance classes (since I was 10) and a weekly video game league (for the past 2 years), and I ran a game club at my university this year. Oh and I have a part-time job.   To me, this feels like almost nothing - before I got to university, I was also in my high school marching band for 4 years (for context - where I live, high school is 3 years. I was given special permission to join the marching band while I was still attending junior high at a completely different school). I played field hockey on my high school team for 3 years as well. In junior high, I was on almost every sports team (each team runs at a different time of year so they dont conflict with each other, but I spent most of each year with practices morning and night), plus I was doing dance competitions almost monthly on top of classes twice a week (+ piano/accordion lessons). In elementary, I sang in the youth choir at my church, and did a year of tap dance before I switched to Highland dance.  And never forget 2014, when I was working 4 part-time jobs at the same time while in school even though I didn't strictly need to..... I also volunteer at the local comic expo every year.  I'm 100% sure I'm forgetting a few things tbh but yeah.....   **tl;dr:** I'm infamous among people who know me irl for being That Person With Too Many Hobbies and I was curious as to who else has also had that experience!

I stay up late at night not because I have insomnia, but I know going to bed is a good idea, but I lack the motivation to go to sleep.  Doesn't help my meds should have worn off by bed time so I can sleep.   Epiphany / rant.

I don't know if this is the right place but I'll try anyway.   For those who don't know I've recently been diagnosed with adult ADHD. Going by my past I've had the traits all my life, I just learnt to deal with them, hide them. I thought they were normal. I'm on dexamphetamine and it's doing a great job.   I had a back issue where I was prescribed Tramadol and Lyrica for back pain. All was going well till one day I ran out of Lyrica. I was on 150mg a day ( 75mg morning evening ) and on them for well over 3 years.   This is the fun part, if you'll call it that. I ran out of lyrica one day and I was thinking about getting of them anyway so I thought no was as good as time as any. First 2 days were fine, 3rd day was the start. On my way to work I started getting panic attacks, my anxiety was up, my mind was a mess. I called in sick and went home.    My fiancée was at home and now I wish she wasn't. I absolutely exploded at her with rage. She said I had pure hate in my eyes. It was all verbal, nothing physical. After apologising profusely I could not think straight and spent the rest of the day in bed.   Next day I forced myself to work. Stayed 1/2 hour,  I was totally confused and went home. I was crying at nothing, paniking over everything couldn't think straight. I went to the doctors pleading with the GP to prescibe me lyrica. Lucky for me he didn't commit me but prescribe Lyrica to my relief. I took double the amount to get it back in my system. The next day I was fine again.   Since being diagnosed with ADHD I wondered if there was any link. I found someone who posted having the same experience and they mentioned something about the brain being flooded with glutimate from withdrawals from lyrica. I started searching about glutimate and ADHD. I found some information but I lack the focus/concentration to read it and remember it.   So I'm hoping someone might know.  I'm still on the lyrica, to scared to stop it until I know what's going on but I'm off the tramadol.

Not sure if it matters,  but my son is on Concerta with a straight Ritalin booster at lunch during the school week. He generally does not take his medication on the weekends.   My son is generally a sweetheart, and somewhat well behaved,  quick to have anger outburts, (which are definitely increasing with puberty), and is very anxious all the time. He also is a food hoarder.  And he sneaks food all the time.  This is where I am struggling,  and reaching out for advice from other folks with ADHD to see if anyone has advice!  I know that the sneaking food is an impulse thing,  and common. My brother was the same way growing up.  My parents were never able to figure out a way to stop it.  I'm at my wits ends with it.  He's even started stealing money,  which he used at the little store he catches the school bus at.  I'm having to lock my room when I leave for work now.  Short of putting a freezer/fridge in my room,  I'm stuck! He has foods that we have told him repeatedly he can snack on whenever, just eat them at the table.  But that's not what he's taking.  Ice cream cones  (which are a treat in our house), blocks of cheese (I can't even buy blocks of cheese anymore), granola bars, anything sweet... I just had a Costco size box of gum disappear that I know I will end up finding in his room when I tear it apart to clean.  We've tried taking away toys, taking away events, video games,  etc... nothing seems to make a difference. And he's not doing it to be naughty,  he's not stopping and thinking about the consequences before he acts.  I'm worried about these tendencies as he grows into an adult!   Any advice is welcome, I'm all tapped out!  ***EDIT***  My main concern is not the healthiness of the food itself, we don't have much junk itself in the house.  He has plenty of healthy food options available to him that he can eat whenever he wants.  My concern is the impulse to sneak food into his room consistently.  It's not the food items, it's the sneaking in general.    TL;DR 11 yo son sneaks food he's not supposed to have into his bedroom.  Fresh out of ideas on how to stop the impulse sneaking.

It started when I had troubles learning in school and my mom took me to a doctor who diagnosed it.     They said that unfortunately in my childhood they couldn't see that I have ADHD because I have a above average intellect and I hide this problem with it.     I got some papers that I can't get grades from math etc...     I don't know really what to do because they said that I can't really recover fully because I got diagnosed too late so I will probably have adult ADHD too. I know that this can get worse and all these things but I don't know what to do.     I think I have severe depression with suicidal tendencies too and I just feel like I don't deserve to be alive when I'm a genetic garbage.     TL;DR: I got diagnosed don't know what to do next.

I'm really scared by posting this question because I don't want to seem like someone who doubt about adhd. I have it, take my pills and do my things but I do have something in my head and needed to see what other thinks about it.*  I was thinking the other day about the fact that my pills help me coping with long hours of work on the computer and it got my to a question...  *What happen if we take a world adventurer and suddenly change is job to being an accountant?*  My guess it that he will show some symptoms like inattention mistakes over the month…  I was told that ADD people have irregulated level of dopamine in the body. I agree on that but I was asking myself if there is there any thought/theory out there about level of dopamine in link with activities/lifestyle?
ac4bb0e597284b33012dd8ddaf0fcab7d3b961f597cbc95b856c0bf9cafbcbc6;;;Stopped medicating because it took away my real personality;;;I'm 22 and was diagnosed 6 months ago with ADD and I've been taking 15 MG once a day for 6 months now. It seems that whenever I get out of work all I want to do is play video games and that's about it. Also my girlfriend and other friends have notice I'm not my self anymore.. I'm not funny or charming like I used to be.. so basically I stopped taking my medicine and I'm back to normal. My girlfriend loves who I am again and I do to...    The point.. should I try new meds or just stay clean off of them? And has anybody else experienced this "loss of personality" from adderal ?
311260b7fb8aa18443ff83f14c2eb888ba3801c8447ada7ea6fcd23736573008;;;New to meds and treatment;;;I had informally been diagnosed (by every teacher, guidance counselor i ever met) as early as second grade with ADD but was never reccomended treatment because I always managed to pull off great test scores and ok grades (though not without lots of epic battles with my parents). It has always been something I just kind of lived with but never really dealt with.  Now I'm all grown up and as it does, life has become vastly more complex. Two young children, getting a house ready to sell, moving etc has become a whole lot to manage, even with the coping mechanisms I've developed. It created enough anxiety that, with the support of my wife, I finally talked to a doctor about it.   Now I am on my third day of meds and holy crap... I haven't felt this good ever. I spent the weekend being super productive, calm, focused etc. My frustration threshold is immensely higher, I am getting along better with everyone.  I know that its not possible that it will always be like this, but I honestly didn't expect the drugs to do anything so I am really impressed with the results.  I know am really starting to take the issue seriously and am wondering what else I could or should be doing as far as treatment. I have seen a bit about cognitive behavioral therapy and exercise being really beneficial.   I also am wondering a lot about diet and meds (I'm on a starter dose of Vyvance), particularly since I have had basically no appetite. I asked my doctor about that and she didn't have anything to say about it. I can afford to lose quite a bit of weight so I'm not concerned about force feeding myself for the sake of eating, I'm just wondering if there are any diets, foods or eating habits that make the meds more or less effective?

I'm thinking about applying to be able to get extra time and/or marking on the booklet to keep my train of thought. I've been diagnosed for 9 years with bi yearly medchecks for my adderall so I think I'm good in that regard but I haven't had an IEP or 509 plan in school due to teachers being able to work with me when I can't focus or finish a test in time etc. Anyways I'm just looking for advice about how to go about it etc. Thanks!
b80bff774210afb73469eea0646f167b7b0a6c1756d7a97203819c0a0c269477;;;After six years of taking adderall daily I have decided (with my Doctor) that it's time to quit. What can I expect?;;;I've been taking 30 mg of Adderall daily for 6 years. I started taking it after I was diagnosed with ADD and it helped a ton. I'm sure most of you guys understand. But the side effects have definitely presented themselves more and more especially in the past year. My anxiety levels have really spiked, I'll find my heart racing at times for no reason, inability to sleep, reoccurring bouts of cystic acne well into my 20's (this isn't a listed side effect, but I've read what seems to be hundreds of posts stating that adderall and acne are definitely connected, my Doctor has even said there may be a connection). I also hate to think that my metal capacities are only what they are because of a pill I'm taking.      After talking with my Doctor we've decided to try tapering off my dosage. This is my last month on 30 mg. Next month it will be 20. If all goes well the next month will be 10 and so on. While this seems like the best way to do it, I am slightly concerned. When I forget to take my pill for the day I become the most lethargic person in the world. While on the meds I wake up everyday at 4:30 to workout, I'm the first person to work, and I can work all day, then I go home and can focus on my own pursuits all night. I eat healthy, I read a ton... I'm just really happy with where I am as a person, and I don't want to lose that because I had to stop taking adderall. Does anyone know how long it takes for your energy to return to normal levels (if it does at all) once you've stopped with adderall? Does anyone have any advice about how to deal with life post adderall? Thanks a ton for any advice you can give me.
7e389e72db732facd97e9edaa584d6a0b317a35b7443f50b81ec14de59a5644f;;;Should I tell my future employer about my prescription before I take the drug test?;;;I take 60mg Methylphenidate CD every day, I have a valid prescription, and I have to take a drug screen.    I have been offered a part time job from the place I've been doing my internship at. They want to hire me on full time after I graduate on May 8th. I have been avoiding talking to them about my ADHD diagnosis, but in order to gain employment with them, I need to take a drug screen.   TL;DR: Should I email my boss before my drug screen about my medication and therefore inform her about my ADHD? Should I bring my prescription to the drug screening place? Or should I stay quiet until it shows up positive?   Any help would be greatly appreciated!   **Edit**: I took the drug screen and I was clean for everything! I guess the Methylphenidate CD was in a low enough dosage. Before I took the drug screen, I told my employer that I was concerned about a prescription showing up and she told me that if anything shows up then the technician will contact me and I will give them the pharmacy's phone number to confirm. Thank you for the advice!

They want another evaluation!;;;In January my psychiatrist suggested I get tested. My ins doesn't cover it so I went to a local university where I have been through three separate evaluations, starting in February. Two weeks ago I had what I thought was the last appointment. They told me a report would be written, it would be approved by the professor, then I would have another appointment to come discuss the results. I have provided school records from kindergarten to college, surveys from my sister, ex husband, self, and a close friend. I took a lot of assessments. Lots of shit.   Today I got a call from them saying there were some missing pages from my surveys and I needed to come redo one of them. They also want to do some other evaluation because I had a previous diagnosis of anxiety.   I'm a 37 year old female. I have never identified with anything more intensely than I do with the symptoms of ADHD that I have been learning about over the last few months. I'm so frustrated and feel like nobody cares.   Edit-- My psychiatrist appointment is today, in about five minutes. I don't have the report of course but I'll see what the doctor says. Does anyone else ever find that you have a ton of things to tell your doc and then when you get to the appointment you just sorta space out and can't pull together anything you wanted to say??
a8cf63d48efa42b6755270fd79cc26ab71802add9fa0ba0d39f2498fd419213c;;;I think my ADD is ruining my relationship... me[28/f] bf[32/M];;;I just got tested for ADD about 8 or 9 months ago and i've been trying out medication. I started out with low doses of ritalin and now i'm at 20 adderall xr. It helps me focus for work, for sure. My relationship is definitely not getting better though. I would like to believe that its half my fault and half my boyfriends fault.   I am VERY forgetful. I never pay attention. One example would be when I go to the grocery store, even when I take my medicine, I forget to look at the dates of the bagged salad. I just buy it, and later I find out, it expires the next day. Those little things I dont look at. i just go through the motions. That is wasting money.  I need to pay attention to the little things. Listen, I also was raised by friends, cousins and never had 2 parents giving me chores, or helping me with things in daily life. I just went along, surviving. I never was taught how to cook, clean everything or grocery shopping, I just taught myself. My bf basically things i'm useless because he's had to teach me normal things a person should know. Like changing the sheets once every month or 2 months, or dusting anything..  He does get on my case a lot, and we end up fighting because he is mad I didnt pay attention. I used to make a list when I went to the store and I would just forget to look at it. Im getting better, where I do get the things he asks for. I've been cutting up fruit that we get.. instead of just letting it sit there.   I do think at times its me being lazy plus ADD. I WANT to do the right things but my brain is just on this 1 way track and I dont come off it to check things, double check, triple check. I just go along with the flow. I HATE IT.   Now I feel like why should my bf even try. He could get a girl that grew up in a proper home that cooks great, cleans great.. maybe she wont be as good looking haha but least he wont get mad at her for dumb stuff. I'm just frustrated and I feel like he is lowering my self esteem but its me that is fucking up. I cant figure out how to just do what i'm supposed to do. I dont need him yelling at me for not putting something away, when he could just do it, and not get mad at me about it. Thats where I mentioned half my fault and half his. There are times where he shouldnt tell me that I messed up, just to tell me and get mad just to get mad.   He says he doesnt want to baby me and lie and say everything is great or that I dont mess up. I feel like he doesnt get it though, he is sort of baby'ing me by scolding me about little things. Its half a realtionship issue and half a LIFE issue.   Anyone have this problem where its hard to adjust to adulthood and owning a house and just functioning on a daily basis?   I take 20 adderall xr and then a 10mg at 2pm. I feel like it helps in the morning but thats about it. It enhances my attention but doesnt help at all times and I dont want to rely on medication either, I want to better myself.    TL;DR very forgetful, any tips on how to become better at adjusting to adulthood and managing a house &amp; relationship.

I'm at college now and I honestly don't think I'd still be there without it, so needless to say it is working. But the problem is when I come home for summer (like I am right now) my mom always has things for me to do, which I have no problem with. I'm living in her house so it's totally fair. But the problem is that a lot of these things I just end up not doing or forgetting, and she blames me for it which I guess is correct, but I can't help it. For example, a few days ago she asked me to put some pictures from my phone onto a flashdrive for her. It took me 5 days to do because I just kept forgetting. It isn't like its a hard task, I could do it in 5 minutes or less. Its just that once she's done ranting at me about how it isn't done yet, it is out of my head and I dont think about it until the next time she gets angry. I try to tell her that I'm not putting it off because Im lazy or anything like that, but that I just keep forgetting/dont think about it. This makes her absolutely furious. She says Im using ADHD as an escape to get away from responsibilities, and at this point I'm starting to believe her. Maybe I am just lazy?? But the thing is it feels as though its impossible to get these things done, like theres a wall there blocking me from doing it or something. Idk how to explain it...she makes me feel awful when I try to tell her what its like for me to deal with these tasks she gives me and she just tells me to stop blaming it on the ADHD. She doesn't understand why I can't complete these seemingly simple chores, and frankly I don't either. Does anyone have any experience with dealing with parents and how to explain to them in a way they will understand? Thanks for reading this wall of text and thanks in advance for any answers.

I can't focus on work. As a matter of fact i just finished watching my coffee maker, watered and feed my dogs and procrastinating work at this moment. I used to have a better support system with my wife at my side, but she's been going thru hard times mentally as well. Almost all of of my family's daily lives depends on my ability to function properly. It become quite stressful!  When i was a young dumb teenager i thought i didnt know who i was as a person cause i had been on medication my whole life. So i irrationally decided to quit taking my med and talked my parents into going with it. Yeah i've struggled these past 15 or more years without the meds but i've always been able to manage it on my own with my SO support of course.  But with recent life changes, i feel myself slipping daily and my chores are building up while my motivation goes down. I have no ambition! The only thing keeping me working is my employees that depend on my to keep work coming in and my clientele that keep demanding me to work!   We'll i'm starting to lose focus again and need to change task. Ill cut this short. Life has been really hard on me the past year but it has also been really rewarding! I'm debating on going back to the Dr. and getting meds again so i can function. But i have a hard time doing it because...well just cause u know... :(  My first post here, sorry if i broke rules or any of that mess. I just really wanted to get this off my chest. If i could i would write more but i need to try and work now!
c128a5d26d7a8f6cefb2ab647bc98ed3c569f3592dc7bd07617eadf1bf5e9036;;;ADHD COFFEE!;;;I was recently diagnosed with adhd as an adult 24. I always had problems since i was a kid and had depression among some anxiety. Finally went to get a good diagnosis and turns out it was adhd causing everything so he prescribed me Ritalin LA 20mg once daily. My question is I love coffee, always have. It has always helped me focus on tasks and wake me up. I am concerned that with my medication the coffee will have negative effects on me. Does any one have some advice on the topic?
a157c82afc19b101ce8e0e408adf5366038fb387048dde7da3e6a25afbc6edbd;;;[Question] How do I stay on the same workout plan for more than 1-2 weeks and finally start to gain weight?;;;Stats: 178cm/22 years old/77kg  So far my lifts are still novice 1RM (92kg squat, 117.5kg deadlift, 72.5kg bench and 60kg overhead).  I've been lifting weights for over two years now on and off. But I'm tired of lifting weights and working out, and I feel like I'm going no where. My main factors are:  1. I don't see results fast (no carrot no work - just like no reward from doing homework). 2. I have trouble keeping the routine and the longest I've been on a workout plan/routine was 3 weeks. Else it lasts 1-2 weeks before I change something in the program or change to new program.  3. I had a bad appetite prior to getting diagnosed and getting meds, but now it's not nearly there at all. Before meds I used to eat because it was work and without eating the required calories I would have wasted a workout or another day of not growing/getting rested, which would halter me even more.     What I've tried:  - Simple and really detailed workout plans &amp; diet plans.  - Atleast 15 novice &amp; intermediate programs (had most succes with BigButBoring and RPT)  - I've calculated my TDEE almost twice a week to see if something wasn't calculated right. I've tried lean gains and 24 hour fasting and I've tried dirty bulking which only made me fatter.   So my question is: How do I keep myself on a program for more than 1-2 weeks and finally start to gain some muscle/lose some fat? I've tried so many things and I know I gotta track my progress over weekly gains instead of daily, and I can do that but I start losing motivation after a week or two of doing that.

Is it the psychiatrists who can give me a prescription for meds or is it the psychologists?

I have 0 extracurriculars, but more than 300 service hours at the same place. I also had a semester long internship at OSU (the college I want to go). Does this seem like a terrible track record? Will colleges not want me? I had a car accident this year, and my meds were changed, and I had some small personal problems that they won't know about. Also I might get c's in 2 high school classes this semester.   TL;DR 20 A's, 2 B's, &lt;-high school classes 1 B-, 1 C-, 1 D+ &lt;-college classes. No extracurriculars, 300+ service hours. Could colleges want me still?

I have severe anger where I physically destroy things. For example, I purposely kicked a hole through my closet door. I've also purposely smashed several of my cell phones. I've physically hit people, etc.. I'm pretty reckless in that sense.  I don't know if that type of anger is more typical of bipolar, I guess.  I'm just trying to learn about ADHD anger, as I've been diagnosed with both ADHD and bipolar.

I'm an art student at CSU Channel Islands, and for our senior Capstone my group members and I created illustrated children's stories about issues related to identity and self esteem.    I chose ADHD as my focal point because we wanted to each write about a topic that was a part of our own, personal identity so as to remain more authentic and representative of our subject matter.  As a woman who was unaware that I was ADHD until I reached my twenties because of inattentive symptoms going unnoticed, it's important to me that ADHD children learn to feel accepting of themselves in spite of the difficulties they face. I want them to know that there is nothing wrong with them just because they struggle with things that some other children may not.  All of our stories are completely free to download as PDFs, and we're simply looking to spread them around in hopes that they will reach parents and children who they will be meaningful to.  If you're interested in taking a look, provided below are some links to the stories as well as social media accounts for them!    I'd love to hear any feedback if you have some. :D I was in quite a bit of a time crunch to meet deadlines for this project, (and my ADHD was certainly no help,) so it may not be perfect, but I've sunk a ridiculous amount of hours into this thing and would be grateful to anyone who feels like sharing it around.  &lt;3  Thank you!  ............................................  ♦ **Head in the Clouds; My ADHD Story-** [**[x]**](http://www.lulu.com/shop/s-grandfield/head-in-the-clouds/ebook/product-22656630.html)  Synopsis- Lia has always breezed by in school, but lately her habit of drifting off and daydreaming in math class has been earning her lower grades than she’s been used to.

This person was very patient when i myself am going through stuff (i never met anyone as patient as this person my whole life); i want to give back and do the same. I wonder if you guys can drop me some tips on how to take care of the likes relationship/friendship-wise? How do i deal with the persons highs and lows? This person is also already off medication and mood stimulants; i feel like it takes a great deal of effort on their part to stay focused without the stuff, or is it true or not? Is it okay for me to constantly bug this person to bring things to attention and remind them things they have to do or not? Also do you have any tips on what food/diet is best for their health? Thank you in advance!

I had to pay £88 for the prescription from Boots, wondering if anyone gets it on the NHS as an adult OR if anyone has a private prescription and gets it cheaper somewhere else? I think someone said it could be £60 at one of the supermarket pharmacies.   I'm also confused because it's used for treatment of ADHD in adults but the leaflet inside is only directed at children ("if you take too much medicine tell an adult!", that kind of thing). Same goes for the literature online.   I'm aware GPs will prescribe methylphenidate on the NHS if someone has an ADHD diagnosis, but I'm not sure about Elvanse?

Sometimes it's hard to remember the positive and it can feel like things are rarely good.*  **We win every single day.**  *We challenge you to write down your wins and see if you feel better looking at the list later in the week. Don’t worry if you miss a day or two or three! Do what you can. Even writing them down one day is a win.*   *** #####The Science Behind Win Wednesday * Scientists think our brain has a built in negativity bias by reacting more to a negative stimulus causing painful experiences to be more memorable than positive ones.    * In effect, our brain is like Velcro for negative experiences and Teflon for positive ones causing us to need a 5:1 ratio of positive to negative interactions to level the playing feild.  * By keeping track of the good you stop positive experiences from slipping away and allow your brain to gather and store the positive. and this slowly changes how your brain is wired over time.  * Much of this information comes from *The Buddha’s Brain* by Rick Hanson. Here is a PDF of his [*Positive Emotions and Taking In the Good*](http://www.rickhanson.net/wp-content/files/PositiveEmotions.pdf).  You can find more at *[rickhanson.net](http://www.rickhanson.net)*  Win Wednesday is a chance to focus on our accomplishments for the week.

As is often the case, the benefits were immediate--I was finally able to reply to emails, do chores, pay bills, and study all in the same day. Needless to say this was just a starting dose, and at my next appointment two weeks later I was bumped up to 20mg XR, then another two weeks later 20mg XR plus 5mg IR later in the day. While the IR bump helped a good part of the time, it sometimes made me a little irritable and extra sensitive to noise, so I tried taking 30mg XR with no bump, and found it gave me the perfect combination of long-lasting and smooth. I'm going to bring this up with my doc at the next appointment on Monday, but it's a bit discouraging that it seems like I'm playing a game of cat and mouse with my tolerance, and I'm wondering how long it takes to find what "works".   tl;dr: Have been on adderall for 2 months, have had to keep upping the dose.

I was diagnosed last month after having a really rough month to the semester. I'm 19, in my sophomore year of college, but my mom always suspected I've had ADHD. After the interview the doc said "well I haven't gone through the numbers yet, but I can tell you have a lot of ADHD." I ended up maxing out all the scales.  So I went to my psych Monday, she (very reluctantly) gave me a prescription for 10mg Adderall twice daily. I took the first pill yesterday, and within half an hour, I felt like a new person. I was able to read an entire article without skipping around to different paragraphs, I sat through all of Civil War without wanting to get up or look at my phone, and I could talk to my friend and stay engaged in the conversation.  I feel great. I realize it's only day two and I'll probably have to make some adjustments up the road, but I'm just so happy that I know I can feel like this.
03f6f979aa0111e1f7a18b9a9ec32e1d5c1adefbd2659c1ada8f770478577dff;;;Bupropion, Seizure, and Alcohol question;;;Hey guys,  A couple weeks ago, my psychiatrist prescribed me Vyvanse 40mg, Bupropion XL 150mg, and Naltrexone 25mg. The Vyvanse is for BED and ADHD-PI. The Bupropion and Naltrexone is for obesity treatment. I'm 25 years old and this is my first time ever getting an ADHD diagnosis.   I understand that it takes a month or so for the Bupropion to build up in your body. If someone has a low enough seizure threshold, do they experience the seizure in the beginning of their bupropion treatment? Or do the seizures normally begin once the medication has built up in your system?   I'm asking because I have to go to a party this weekend and I don't want to come off as a Sober Sally (peer pressure is awesome) but I'm a little concerned about risking a seizure. I also have my cousin's wedding in mid-June which will probably involve some moderate to heavy drinking. For the record, I'm not an alcoholic but I like to have a little fun every now and then.   Not sure if relevant but all the common side effects of the vyvanse wore off after the first day of taking it (dry mouth, fast heart rate, etc.). I began taking the Bupropion/Naltrexone 4 days after starting vyvanse and those side effects also went away after the first day (Irritability, tiredness, depression, GI issues, etc.).   Appreciate the help.

I've met wit ha GP today who prescribed a small 20mg dosage of Vyvanse for the first few days and then a ramp up to 30mg for the month and we will have a follow up in a few weeks to see how the medication affects me.  Only a few hours in I feel so relieved. I read the honeymoon period is temporary and I will embrace that feeling for now but I am finally able to think about *nothing*... I wonder if this is something common with Vyvanse? I am able to completely focus my thoughts, I can have clear and concise thoughts that are not obstructed by negatives thoughts or replaced by a thousands of ideas. But the fact that I am able to close my eyes and just relax and not have rushing thoughts in my head is such a relief.  I don't feel a huge improvement on my motivation, but I do feel a huge difference on my focus with just a small dosage. Just wanted to share!

I like to tell people about what ADHD is really like. And I was wondering if there are some things you guys would like me to make sure people know.;;;I'm not asking you to write my material. Just some points to bring up. Things like,   1). ADHD isn't just about seeing a squirrel or something shiny.   2). It's like not having a filter. My body is like a bad older brother that makes me do stuff to get me in trouble. My Brian is like should I draw a penis on this wall? By the time I decide it's a bad idea there's 50 little dongs on the wall.   3). Appear lazy. Not on purpose.   4). Medications and why we need it.   This isn't my finial material.

I was diagnosed with ADHD-NOS when I was 17 (diagnosis made during an updated psychological evaluation for accommodations for college) I have not taken medication, but have been to therapy (for anxiety) and  I have developed good coping mechanisms and my grades are better than they've ever been, things are going well, but I have had some issues: I am studying music performance in college, and I am very frustrated that I am not able to focus as much as I would like to in ensemble rehearsals. I miscount rests because I am not paying attention and feel like I am in a constant mental "cloud" and make careless errors even when I have practiced my parts obsessively. Though I have improved immensely musically while in school and am a strong musician, I feel like I am not performing at my true potential.  As I've played in more advanced groups recently, I notice how focused musicians need to be for rehearsals-- so many strong/pro musicians have this amazing mental sharpness and focus that I can only dream of emulating and I feel like is completely hindered by my ADHD. As an aspiring professional musician, I have been considering medication recently for this purpose.  But, almost everything else in my life has been just fine and I'm coping with my symptoms well, and it feels so strange to medicate for this one (albeit very important) part of my life. I am just very frustrated, I would never want my career plans to be hindered by my symptoms.  Any thoughts/advice? I would really really appreciate it!!

Besides that, this has been legal (diagnosing and prescribing treatment to adults) only since this january (and the prescribing only since June). Also, my psychiatrist subbmited my file to some kind of councis to decide wheter or not should I get Strattera for free and they declined it because "I haven't been following any adhd treatment for the last 2 years since I am an adult." (I'm almost 20 now). And so even if my doctor had good intentions, well, my country is broken and so my only option is to leave as soon as possible and move to a country that is more.... SANE. (which I would have anyway but it would have been nice to start the treatment now).  TL;TR: Doctor wants to prescribe me strattera, I don't want it, I want concerta.  Ok guys, thing is, I've taken strattera when I was a child, since I was 8 years old up to 13-14. It wasn't doing any good for me, only possibly for my mom since she didn't have to come to school anymore the trouble I ould have cause.  Strattera was bringing me down, TOO down, I mean I went from the adhd kid who's always causing trouble and is violent and such, to the guys who's almost always sleeping in class, and I was just, not responsive, I kinda had deppression symtoms.  If only it would have fixed the thing that (now) matter's, the mental processes, concentration, motivation, all things that left untreated will surely wreck your life. It certainly did NOT.  Basically I was a "good/quiet boy" but I couldnt focus for sht, I start my homework late, like 8 or 10 in the evening and finish it ALWAYS past midnight.  My mother didn't care about this, she only cared about not being shamed for my behaviour. And so, she didn't report these symptoms to my psychiatrist and I think she probbably didnt even think they were symtoms of a thing.  At about the age of 13 my psychiatrist stopped my strattera treatment because she thought I was cured... Yea, thing is, where I live, ADHD is treated with ridicule and disbelief (by the general populationd AND the psychiatrists), and on top of that there is also a general phobia of medication in my country.  After that I have lived untreated untill now, I'm 19, 20 next month, and I've been seing a new psychiatrist who I belive is one of the fewest open-minded (or better said, not ignorant) psychiatrist in my country who has given me for the last 2 months bupropil (and I've also done cbt) and next month she wants to give me strattera...  Now, she has been very understaing and nice to me but I really don't want to take strattera again, I'm aware that it might have different or even better effects now that I'm an adult but I really don't want to take this medication, I am really frustrated right now that I'll go the same road or actually now that I'm an adult I'll go a VERY bad road, probably the same it would be if left untreated. I'm affraid to straght out ask her to not give be strattera but concerta instead (I would have preferred adderall but that's not available where I live) because I could be seen as a junkie or just some guy seeking to get high. I'm aware that she probably want's to try to treat me with a non-stimulant instead of a stimulant as it would have less sideeffects, but I'm in a really bad spot in my life and I REALLY can't waiste time trying a medication that will take 4-6 weeks to start having effects instead of taking a medication which effect's I can observe immediatly.  How should I proceed in my attempt of swaying her (medical) opinion? What would be the most succesfull way of changing her mind?

A doctor had the sense to send me to a psychiatrist who performed several tedious tests.   I filled out the questionairs, I took some IQ tests, I sat in front of a computer for 20 minutes and pushed a button every time I heard or saw the #1 and poof!   I have Adult ADHD.   Which makes sense I guess because my mom was told by several teachers when I was a kid that they thought it was ADD but since it was the 90's my mom didn't believe in ADD and ignored them, and enrolled me in dance class, and told me that I was smarter than how i was acting and to smarten the fuck up and pay attention..ha ha ha   Also my dad's parents were told he had an issue, I don't think they called it ADD but did tell them to go on pills to deal with his inattentiveness and rambunctiousness . Since it was the 70's his parents really didn't believe there was an issue and bought him some drums instead.  good times.   Anyway, here I am diagnosed and on a prescription of 30 mg of Vyvanse per day.  Only issue: EATING! Some of you have probably been on vyvanse.  Here is what happens: I am hungry 25/7, like tummy rumbling ravenous, hungry to the point of feeling like I am gong to throw up.   However, despite my body ques that I am super hungry, I can't bring myself to eat anything...at all and not like ones of those    "*OMG guys I can't eat all the pizza I used to I can only eat two slices instead of five! #sohungry*"  It has been a day since I've eaten anything at all and this week since Monday I can tell you I've eaten 2 pieces of toast 2 eggs and one granola bar. Since Monday... and it is now Thursday that is **all** I have eaten.   I know I am so hungry but when I look at food my mind goes...*meh no thanks maybe later. *  Now I am **not** a small girl. I was 240 lbs, 6 months ago, did a keto diet went down to 180 lbs, so I certainly have the extra fat on me that I am not in danger of wasting away for a while.   I have also been taking  a plethora of vitamins because they are supposed to help with the ADHD and keep me from having this dreaded "crash" I keep reading about on Vyvanse.  I sleep fine. I don't get tired irritable or dizzy like I normally would if i skip a meal. I have energy and productiveness, and  feel great. My blood pressure is fine.   Essentiall,y my body doesn't seem to be giving a shit that I don't want to eat anything. I know this isn't healthy and eventually it will become a real issue. I've dropped 6 lbs this week.  Anyone who has experienced this, any tricks on getting yourself to eat something? when I do eat food, I have to resist the urge to spit it out because it is making me feel nauseated. GIVE ME YOUR TIPS AND TRICKS!!!   **TL;DR holy crap sooo many words!sorry!! How do you make yourself eat on vyvanse? also apparently medicated me talks like a 15 year old girl...I apologize.**

I am considering going to my school's accessibility services to ask about accommodations, but I learned my college's counseling center now offers something called "ADHD evaluation" for like $200. I did not have to pay $200 for what I did with the school psychologist. He had me fill out some paperwork and had my sister and best friend also fill out some paperwork. So I imagine this "evaluation" probably involves some actual testing.  I don't know if I'll be required to go through that for the accommodations or not. Their policy is really unclear about it. But if I do need it, well, I'm kind of nervous.  What happens during the testing? Do you like play a special game on a computer or something? Does a psychologist or psychiatrist listen to you talk? How do they determine whether you have ADHD or not?  It makes me nervous because I know there's no completely accurate, foolproof "test" for ADHD, and I've always been somewhat unusual. I've always been a high-achieving student and I actually do pretty well on tests. So I'm worried that they'd just see me doing well on whatever tests they have and decide that means I don't actually have ADHD or something. If I could just take them home with me and let them watch how I live and do things I think they'd get it, but no one ever thought I might have a problem as a kid because my academic performance was above average, and I'm worried that it'll be the same way with this evaluation, whatever it is.   So yeah, I don't know what to expect if it turns out I do need that. :\

But usually every friday and saturday i start work between 5-7 pm and end around 9-12 pm so im pretty sure my dose will be worn off by then if i take it at 9 am.

He is a veteran and was diagnosed with adult ADHD while he was in the military, but he's unmedicated. Now he's out in the civilian world and just scraping by financially and socially.   I didn't realize how bad things had gotten for him until last week when his car was reposessed. He recognizes that he's at fault and accepts full responsiblity (and, to his credit, he remedied the situation relatively quickly and got his car back), but I'm worried that he's not going to take the necessary steps (trading in his current SUV for a less expensive car, moving to a smaller home) to get his life back on track.   We separated for a variety of reasons, some of which are my own issues -- but his ADHD symptoms, including extreme financial irresponsibility, didn't help. I bugged him for years to see a professional, but I always got the "Alright, I'll call someone tomorrow." Eventually I stopped asking.   I realize now that I need to be more proactive with him. I love him and I want to see him reach his full potential. He's incredibly smart, funny, and just a generally wonderful guy, but his life is a mess. If you were in his situation, how would you want to be helped? Should I make a therapist appointment for him, or is that condescending?   **tl;dr**: Adult husband has ADHD and won't help himself. What can I do for him?

I just now (at 28) had someone look at my chart and symptoms and instead of prescribing me anti-anxiety and anti-depressant medication went, "Oh. Here, try some Ritalin instead." Before I was on Lexapro and Wellbutrin and felt *horrible* and have been through a song and dance of different medications that have mostly made me feel like crap. **The excuse my ex-psych gave me for not prescribing stimulants was that they made autistic people "aggressive and violent" and made anxiety far worse.**   **Turns out it's the total opposite.** I am far, far less irritable, more patient and calm, and face challenges or hangups way more easily instead of just getting frustrated and giving up. I have virtually no anxiety now.  The last three days really have been incredible. **I've gotten so much work done**, caught up on my sculpting commissions, drawn more than I've drawn in the past six months in the last three days and generally have just been creating my brains out. It's incredible. I finally have the capacity and drive to just do the things I want or need to. Store? No problem. Laundry? Done. Writing? PAGES. **This is important because I make my living through art and I've been at a standstill for ages.**  **I am so scared this will go away.** I'm scared that the medication will stop working at some point or that this is just a "honeymoon" period and next week I'll be back to endlessly cycling between reddit and Facebook in a totally unproductive haze. It's like **Flowers for Algernon**; what if I just go back to the way I used to be? What if this is only temporary. I've had periods of burst creativity fade into nothing before.   **tl;dr** Finally got medication (combination of 20mg Ritalin and 300mg Wellbutrin) after 4 years. Scared my productivity, self-discipline and creativity will go away again and leave me miserable and anxious because I can't create anything. Halp.
64ce1bcf31df57696edda1c6383976e6ff336c7f0df536ba851cc5af3632ca63;;;Ritalin suddenly started making me anxious, can't focus, brain stuttering -- what gives?;;;Well guys I am back again, trying to understand the newest problems associated with my meds.  I was diagnosed two months ago with inattentive ADD.  I was initially put on Ritalin 5mg 2x daily. I was doing swimmingly, everything was peachy, and then about two weeks ago I was switched over to Concerta 18mg. It was horrible. It didn't metabolize properly, so I was grouchy and tired all the time, with no ability to focus or do anything.  My psychiatrist quickly switched me back to the Ritalin 5mg 3x and when I reported the following week it wasn't helping, she upped to 10 mg. I have been growing continually more anxious throughout the past week. My brain feels like it's stuttering. I was supposed to write a letter to my psychiatrist updating her on the situation, but I couldn't get it together to string it up for three days. My sleep is also way more erratic. In this case, I was worse on the Ritalin than off, because today I have not taken any and I feel loads better.  I have my next appointment on Monday and I don't think I am going to take any Ritalin before then. I am very uncomfortable with the idea of continuing on Ritalin.  Has anybody else experienced this? Could the Concerta have caused this?

I'm going to come in with a treatment maintenance sheet with my diagnosis, medicines I'm on, ones I don't respond well to, and explaining my my anxiety and depression. After you were diagnosed and had to switch doctors, what sort of questions did the new doctor ask you and what did they make you do before they were willing to recognize your ADHD and treat it? Thank you so much.

My fiancée knows, my parents know and my boss knows. That's it. It's not that I'm ashamed. It's that I don't want to feel like I'm making excuses for who am and the flaws I have; I also feel like people won't understand and may dismiss it. Is there anyone else that keeps their condition to themselves?

I still have this issue post meds.;;;Before i was diagnosed, I always used to have absolute hell losing everything. my parents packed me 20 sharpened pencils each day before school because they knew i'd lose it all. I'd also lose so much of my stuff on a daily basis and if I was very lucky I'd find it in a few months somewhere. It also always used to drive me **ABSOLUTELY FUCKING BERSERK** when my parents used to organize for me because they'd put everything in locations without telling me making it even harder to find anything.      Nowadays with meds things are a lot better, but I still have a habit to forget to put things where they're supposed to be at least a few times a day, and it's still annoying.

b364ce436c8eb9d3e512d44397f05b587fb37fa0f625792774f4cdd405f5d3d0;;;Continuation: How I Became a Happier and More Productive Man After an ADHD Diagnosis at The Age of 27;;;Hello,    I have gotten some questions regarding my [previous post](https://redd.it/4n9uou) and will try to provide more information here.     **My intention for writing this post is to help others by sharing how I've come to manage my ADHD and Social Anxiety the last couple of months. I don't claim to be right or know all the answers. This is a learning process for us all. Hopefully this post paves the way for intelligent discussions on how we can all learn to manage our symptoms better.**    ##Medication - I started taking medication a year ago and finally reached a stable dosage after five months. I am currently taking Vyvanse. I was honest with my Psychiatrist when I noticed that the FDA dosage limit was insufficient for me. She was understanding and provided me the appropriate dose. **Medication is the foundation of my ADHD treatment, but it’s only the start. Medication is a tool that allows me to focus, which helps me become aware of myself, which helps me direct my focus on my priorities and interactions.** - It's challenging, but possible to live without medication. After reading the first couple pages of "In Search of Lost Time" by Marcel Proust, you can experience what I believe to be his ADHD symptoms. He wrote one of the best literary works of art, but went to great lengths to remove distractions - i.e., nailing cork board around his entire room to muffle out distractions.    ##Health: Moderate Alcohol, Sugar, and Caffeine Intake - **I do not drink alcohol and I refrain from sugary drinks and caffeine.** I am human and have the capacity to enjoy pleasures, but I force myself to remember the effects of pleasures like drinking alcohol or sugary drinks. **One cocktail can negatively impact my focus for a week.**   - I do enjoy an afternoon tea and biscuit, but I have to be conscious of the amount of sugar I am consuming and be aware that my focus, actions, and decisions can be impacted by the effects of sugar.  - **I drink tons of water, but grab a gatorade whenever I feel unusually dehydrated.**  - **Visine is a must for me. My eyes tend to dry up often. I carry a small bottle in my office bag and keep a spare at home. I have 20/20 vision, but was able to get a prescription for reading glasses to prevent my eyes from straining after hours of reading.**   ##Food: Crucial for the ADHD Mind - Vyvanse suppresses my appetite and have learned to be very cautious with my food intake. **I found that routine works best.** Just like your mind, your body will adjust.   - **Protein is a must. It provides a steady source of energy.**   - **In terms of calories, I try to split my meals with 50% of the calories consisting of protein and 50% consisting of carbs. Chicken, fish, brown rice, quinoa, oatmeal, potatoes, etc.** Again, your body will adjust.    - **My usual day consists of:**   - **7am:  ~a cup of cooked oatmeal** (Two packets of the lower sugar instant oatmeal, or a packet and a half of the 10g protein oatmeal.)   - **11am: ~a chicken breast and ~2 cups of brown rice** (I honestly go to the same restaurant, at the same time, and order the same food every day.)   - **6pm: ~40 grams of protein and ~2 cups of brown rice or quinoa**  - I’m a small guy and currently only swim on Saturdays, so I usually consume 1,500 calories a day.   - When I notice my blood sugar drop in the late afternoon, I grab a small bite at a coffee shop or I'll have a Soylent (I keep a stash at work).   - **The body will adjust if you train it to only eat when it is time to eat.** I believe the French follow this belief. This mentality allows me to focus on my priorities until the time rolls by to eat.   - My boyfriend is well aware of how food also affects my mood and executive function, so he prepares me food when my blood sugar is obviously low (when I show signs of frustration/irritation). **I’ve explained to him that decisions become extremely difficult when my blood sugar is low, so he needs to take the lead for me during those times because I won't be in the right state of mind.**   ##The ADHD Mind: Conquering Your Mind Requires Patience and Persistence  - **The ADHD mind is a wild beast that must be tamed. To tame the mind, we must first become aware of our mind and constantly be on guard. The experience of restlessness, disrupted sleep, impulsivity, anxiety are all things unconsciously created by our minds. Since our minds create these experiences, we have the capacity to control our mind and do away with our restlessness, disrupted sleep, impulsivity, and anxiety.** I achieved this by being mindful, daily meditation, Stoic philosophy, and by constantly bringing my focus back to the present.  - **I grew up in a home full of people with ADHD, bipolar, and schizophrenia - all undiagnosed. I viewed and lived with the belief that the symptoms listed above were normal. I now believe that these emotions disrupt our lives because of a lack of mental discipline. Through a lot of hard work and mental effort, we can learn to slow down our minds.** I am now able to feel my anxiety as it arises. When it does, I say “this is anxiety.” and return my focus to my task at hand. Lingering on that feeling or emotion removes my focus from the task at hand and only worsens the anxiety. **The ADHD mind finds stimulation by feeling these disruptive emotions. We must discipline ourselves on how to prevent these emotions from taking over our life.**   ##The Sleep Paradox - I prefer a **cool, dark, and quiet bedroom.** My mind is always on, so any noise or light will prevent me from falling asleep. I use a blind fold and ear plugs. **I have always suffered from insomnia, but lately I have been able to fall in a deep sleep within a minute by calming my mind.** I find my comfortable position and focus on my breathing.  - I’ve noticed that **my ADHD symptoms are worse if I get 8 hours of sleep,** so I force myself to sleep no more than 7 hours. I created repeating calendar events on my phone to remind me when to shut off screens, when to start my night routine, and when to head to bed. I could work until 2am if I don’t set a reminder.    ##Attention: The Latin Origin of the Word - When we think of the meaning of attention, what comes to mind? I recently found out that the word **‘attention’ comes from the latin word ’attendere’ which means to “stretch/turn toward.” It’s as if the Romans wanted to convey the effort required to pay attention.** And the Latin word for “to notice” something is literally “to turn one’s mind.”  - **Attention requires effort, but most that effort revolves around conquering our distractions.**   ##Academic Journals - I don’t have a particular preference, but have been able to find some good material on Jstor. Reading academic journals might not sound exciting to many, but look for things that interest you. **I find reading on ADHD symptoms interesting because it helps me discover how my mind works and how I can better manage it.**   ##Talk Therapy - I highly recommend talk therapy to those who need more guidance. Personally, I have found it difficult to find a good therapist. I have a very generous insurance plan and it was still a challenge. My boyfriend currently sees a private therapist, so that is a possibility. Honestly, **I found reading academic journals and listening to academics more beneficial than therapy.**  - **I would never discourage anyone from seeking talk therapy. Try it for a couple months and see how things go.** - Neuropsychologist Evenlyn Miccio at Kaiser Permanente in San Francisco is an amazing person. She does a lot of work on ADHD and loves talking about it. [She gives weekly workshops in SF.](https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/ncal/provider/evelynmiccio/about/professional?ctab=About+Me&amp;to=1) - **Neuroscientist Nora Volkow has also done impressive research on ADHD, dopamine, and addiction.**    ##Reflect and Learn from Past Experiences. Learn From the Experiences of Others, Too. - **Pay attention to people that you admire and identify their key traits.** My company's CEO is a complete bad ass. **She is always calm, friendly, rational, and an amazing speaker.** - My boyfriend and co-workers thought it would be weird, but I typed up a list of questions that I wanted to ask the CEO and **sent her an email expressing my desire to interview her. I attached the list of questions as a symbolic gesture that I was prepared and would not waste her time.** Of course, I had to make sure that my email and attachment were free of errors and formatting was spot on. (If you plan on emailing your CEO, make sure you read the business writing book listed below.) - **I learned a great deal from the CEO in those 30 minutes. I could not believe how insightful and honest she was.** - The CEO had gotten her Bachelor's in Philosophy, so **she was a great fan of the Stoics** and was well aware of how she embodied Stoic principles. I'll have to create a different post on the advice she passed down to me.  - [Get the Most Out of Informational Interviews from HBR](https://hbr.org/2016/02/how-to-get-the-most-out-of-an-informational-interview)    ##Improve Your Communication: Take a Business Writing Course (or Read HBR's Guide to Better Business Writing) - **Just like a tidy and organized workspace puts us in a better mood, I believe that mindful writing does the same.** - **Business writing helps me focus on the message I want to say, and helps me say it in the clearest and most concise way possible.** Perfect for those ADHD and great for those without ADHD. - It helps you, the writer, to carefully consider your audience. **Business writing allows you to present the information in a format that is easily understood in the quickest way possible.**  - My posts have been organized (to the best of my ability) in a business writing format to help those with ADHD to easily navigate the information.

I started at 18 mg and when it was adjusted accordingly to fit my needs, I was taking a total of 90 mg of concerta and 10 mg in the middle of the day to keep it going longer. I always had horrible comedowns that resulted in aggression and depression and horrible headaches.   I stopped for a couple years (because I just couldn't handle the feeling of the comedown), and in that time, basically got nothing done and goofed off. I decided I needed to take it again.   I've been taking 54 mg, and the decrease in appetite was expected, but I manage to at least eat 1200 cal a day at some point. What I need some advice on is how to reduce the effects of the comedown, I get very irritable and just all-around indifferent to anything going on around me. I get a bad headache, and somewhat blurry vision at some points. I feel like doing something but almost as quickly as I think of it, I hate the thought of doing anything. My SO that I live with doesn't like how I act when I comedown, and I try to be as positively interactive as possible, but it's a huge internal struggle for me. I don't know what to do, and any advice would be greatly appreciated.
e67c5f75d115f8b71edee2ca37373fb5b737aa4cc1ff4d9a105696f7bb190eaa;;;Psychiatrist is trying to cut me off from Vyvanse because of negative side effects, what do I do?;;;Hi all. First time poster, long time lurker.  A bit about me so it can help you understand what's below: Female, 23 years old, 5'6", 120 lbs.   I was diagnosed with ADHD in December at the age of 23 after being in a psych facility for 2 weeks because of increased depression. After tons of experimenting with dosages, I found that Vyvanse 70 mg is the most effective for me when it comes to concentration and getting work completed. In that time, my anxiety has increased greatly (panic attacks once a month), my heart rate randomly goes up to 125+ bpm at times, shaky hands, getting high blood pressure, weight loss of 15 lbs in 5 months (this I'm okay with). I am also taking Lexapro 10mg for depression.  Today, my psychatrist decreased my dosage to Vyvanse 50 mg and increased Lexapro to 20 mg in the hopes to trying to ween me off of it. She also wants me to consult a cardiologist to see if I need to be completely off of Vyvanse. I do NOT want that to happen because I've never felt so much like an adult until I got on Vyvanse 70 mg. I get so much done at work and even got a promotion! What can I do?  TL;DR: Psych wants to take me off of Vyvanse because of stupid side effects but I've never felt better (mentally) until I got on it.
e0146e5ee263781340b4dc0d5537217e2cbd8961d18ef79d93faef2def9b72f1;;;[rant] first day off meds tomorrow at work since starting.;;;Okay so here it goes.  Went through a rough patch, had no idea what the fuck was wrong with me, after some late night self-loathing/googling realized that I might have adhd. everything I do totally clicked.  called lots of psychiatrists. a month of looking later I finally had an appointment with a psychiatrist. we talked. "yep that sounds like adhd, call this guy to get tested, here's a scrip for adderall" (I assumed primarily hyperactive/impulsive).  start on adderall (small dose, 10mg) and it's life changing. never felt this calm in my life. start killing it at work, start understanding my relationships from new lights, and start just becoming more grounded.  I don't have to go to the bathroom every two hours to stand up.  I can actually just stay seated.  I'll remember to get up and eat lunch when I'm working as opposed to just getting sucked into what I'm doing.  I once didn't eat for two days because I was so absorbed in everything.  The only problem, XR wears off on me around 3.  Tried a 5mg IR booster, didn't feel anything.  Tried a 10mg booster, the crash was so unpleasant.  Switched to concerta.  It slows me down in the same way adderall does, but doesn't actually calm me.  Stop taking it, because it stops working really quickly.  By the end of week 2 on it, sitting at my desk I notice my leg is jittering like fuck.  I'm a really jittery person, but when I take adderall, so much of that goes away.  Concerta *sometimes* helps with that.  Take the TOVA test as well as a super long questionnaire from the other doctor. Fast forward a few weeks to this morning.  My results on the tests were consistent with a diagnosis of "mild ADHD-Predominantly hyperactive/impulsive", but they also deduced that I could have an anxiety disorder.  My psychiatrist said that she was surprised that it wasn't more severe, and she wants to stop trying to figure out the situation with medicine until she understands what *exactly* is going on with me.  So she won't prescribe more meds.  So, tomorrow is my first day without meds at the office.  I'm really fucking anxious (heh), because the adderall helped like crazy, and while the concerta didn't work as effectively as the adderall, it definitely helped... I'm really afraid I'll stop performing well, fuck everything up, and fall right back into my rough patch....  What should I do in this situation?
826aa2e09ed322bc86b8e58ffd515c6832d2d1f658bc4dbbc7e26b9f01bc8763;;;Doctor diagnosed me with depression again instead of referring me to psych like I asked;;;For my entire life I have been unable to focus and study, or read a book without perfect ideal conditions. I find myself always making organizational leaps in my life only to never fulfil them or ignore them after a week. Instead of doing the important things I need to for work, life or advancing my life I would instead, take a nap or suddenly feel the need to scrub the whole kitchen at 3:30am.   I just reciently realized I should be legit tested for ADD/ADHD. My partners mother is RN who has it and she advocated me seeing the doctor to get a referal to get tested.   Previously in 2012 I was diagnosed with depression and prescribed wellbutrin. This was after college ended and I was doing nothing but working a job I despised. It was horrible and I hated everything more once taking that drug. I felt like I was always looking through frosted glass. I stopped taking it.   I made the appointment and went, asking specifically to get a referal to get tested for ADHD/ADD. He and I have never met before as he's the new doctor to the staff. He asked me what symptoms I presented with leaving me to scramble with words and panic. I just kind of threw sentences at him, trying to recall specifics. He stopped me and told me he thinks I have depression and would like to give me wellbutrin again. He told me I needed to lose weight and work out as it will help with that. I just sat there and cried. He knew me for all of 10 minutes with no questions or testing and decided my future for me.   How do I move past this? I'm not going to take that damn medicine again, and I can't see a specialist until I get a referral.   I'm considering calling to make a office appointment with him and talk further. I want to write everything down before going in so I'm not scrambling or panicking.

I have a weird case in that I have found a few drugs that work for me, but the side effects greatly overwhelm any good the drugs have.  I have stuck it out for weeks hoping side effects would go away and they never would.  I metabolize drugs very slowly. A 2.5mg dose of Adderall 2 times a day is more than enough for me. However, even at this ridiculously low dose, I am too dizzy to function, and get no sleep. I can't drive, I can't go running, I can not do any type of workout what so ever (among other more tolerable side effects).  Imipramine and it's family of drugs (non stimulant) also work for me, but hilariously, have the exact same effects of stimulants on me. Can't sleep, too dizzy to do anything, dry mouth, headaches, etc...  I have been diagnosed and tried to help 5 separate times in my life by 5 separate doctors, and every time I hit the side effect brick wall and am given no other drug free options.  The two things I am trying to really figure out are sleep and focus. Good sleep I am sure will help with focus, but after a sleep and narcolepsy study, I have been told I sleep "poorly" and there is no diagnosable medical reason for it...  Ugh.

I talked to my dad about going to the doctor to get more medication but he doesn't think I need it. He just thinks I'm a lazy high school kid. ADHD has seriously affected my life. I've tried meditation and binaural beats to help with it but have been unsuccessful. I don't know how to explain it to him. Any tips?

This may sound a little weird but here is my situation (followed by the question itself).  I moved in the UK 2 years ago and am originally from Switzerland. My native language is french but I only speak in english since I moved here, apart with a few friends and my fiancee.  The thing is, despite the fact that I speak english quite well (I guess/hope), I struggle so much to retain information.  Typically at work, I have to write absolutely everything or else, I simply don't remember it. Same for the products we sell, I had to work a lot more than my colleagues because I simply didn't remember some characteristics of said products.   So, do you thinks this is ADHD related, or it's something that is perfectly normal for someone who doesn't speak his/her native language ?

Pretty much since I stopped growing and finished highschool. Getting my meds back in North Carolina was super easy because I had been going to the same doctor since I was diagnosed as a kid. 3 months supply of Concerta? "NO PROBLEM! I know you're not abusing." Plus my mom was always the one who handled the medication. All the names, doses, pickup, etc....  Now that I am married and have moved to Virginia, the past two years have been such a headache. Seems like no matter what documentation I provide, nobody wants to prescribe me the meds I need until I go to a psychiatrist. Finally make an appointment with psychiatrist for a month later...Doctor has moved. Make another appointment for a month later....Appointment canceled. Make another appointment for a month later (a month is always the soonest they can get me in.) Meanwhile, I'm going from "emergency refill" to "emergency refill" giving me JUST enough to get me by, all the while being met with skeptiscm as to why I have had to get so many. All of my backup, emergency stashes are dwindling and I hate not having the peace of mind knowing I have a few extra days if I run out...The people that abuse the medication really make it tough for the rest of us to get what we need.

It can be frustrating for a parent, teacher, and peer to have to work with someone like myself who was diagnosed with ADHD. Some control over the child is necessary in early stages of life so that the child gets proper supervision and guidance. Anyone who has ADHD is naturally resistant to most forms of control and it's not because we are rebellious or bad, but simply because we don't always listen and the cause for this is not in our direct control. The natural response anyone gives when they are frustrated is a need to acquire control; to do that someone may resort to any measures they deem necessary such as shouting or hitting. When someone gets frustrated they exert their natural need for control on any possible source of that frustration such as children, especially the ones with ADHD.  A source that frequents the feeling of frustration will cause anyone to want to avoid that source and/or show frequent signs of irritation. It's not wrong to feel that way and it's not insensitive, it's how everyone feels when they're mad but can't do anything about it. People avoided me and acted irritated around me because I am a source for their frustration despite myself not really knowing why. This frequent treatment and isolation created a false idea that something is inherently wrong with me.   "Perhaps I'm stupid?" "Perhaps I'm ugly?" "Perhaps I'm just a bad kid?"  These thoughts frequently crossed my mind on a daily basis and eventually this manifested itself as a form of social anxiety. I had no real idea what was wrong with me so I looked to what other people had to say about me and took it as truth.  What I didn't understand then (but I fully understand now) was that everyone has their own insecurities and problems. A popular way for people to deal with their insecurities (children and teenagers especially) is to transfer those insecurities onto someone else.   "Perhaps I'm not tough enough?" The typical solution many of us subconsciously make is to make ourselves seem tougher by bullying someone.  "Perhaps I'm not pretty enough?" The typical solution many of us subconsciously make is to make ourselves seem prettier by making someone else feel ugly.  "Perhaps I'm not smart enough?" The typical solution many of us subconsciously make is to make ourselves seem smarter by making someone else feel stupid.  You get the idea right? It's a coping mechanism called "transference". My developing social anxiety made me vulnerable and this made me an easy target. I was a transference sponge - soaking up everyone's insecurities, believing every word of it. Their insecurities became my insecurities. My self-confidence plummeted and my self-loathing skyrocketed.   So now I'm almost 22 and I've never had a girlfriend, never loved, and never learned to be myself because I've always thought something was wrong with me. I have trouble sleeping because my mind is always racing with anxious thoughts and I've developed an eating disorder to cope with the loneliness of isolation -&gt; which made me fat -&gt; which worsened my loneliness.  What I know now that I wish I knew back then was that the only thing that was actually wrong with me to begin with was believing that something was wrong with me. That paradox is the sum of my childhood.

At first I thought I was very unlucky. Then I started thinking I was making bad career choices. Then I noticed the only common factor was me, and started blaming myself.  (And now I think it's probably ADHD....while still feeling like it's my fault / responsibility)   &amp;nbsp;   Thing is, I've lost all motivation. I quit my last job a year ago and I've been doing a little freelance work here and there, but mostly I'm just whining and feeling stuck / like crap. I went back to my parents' place but it's not going very well, and I can't blame them for wanting me to "wake up" and "get on with my life".   &amp;nbsp;   I feel like there is no job out there that will satisfy me, ever. I see hurdles and frustration everywhere, which is why it's so hard to get started. I understand it's more of a mindset problem than an actual career issue, which is why I'm posting here... Could also be a self esteem / confidence problem. After all my past failures, how can I possibly believe that there's anything good out there?  &amp;nbsp;   **TL;DR: Every career option looks frustrating / not worth the effort / full of red flags.**  **Have you ever faced similar issues? Do you have tips on finding your groove again?**   &amp;nbsp;  I'm open to reading millions of books / watchings hours of videos / working with a coach (so if you can recommend one &amp; they work with Skype that'd be awesome).

Yesterday was the first day of summer. It was also the same day that my mother, who is not a doctor, decides to "detox" me. Yesterday, I woke up at 11 am feeling fine, with a just a slight headache. 3 pm was when things started going to shit. The headache became throbbing and my body started aching and I was sweating. I told my mother that I was in pain, and she said, "you need to take a break off of this stuff, your too skinny." When I asked for a small dose to take the pain away, she got mad and said, "you sound like a junky!". My mother comes from a family of addicts; her dad, my dad, and her siblings are all addicts/alcoholics. Because she is the only "clean" person in the family, she sees herself as superior to the rest of us. However I am not a junky. I have diagnosed adhd and use adderall to feel normal and function in day to day life. She knows nothing about "detoxing". She holds the meds and locks them up, just like she locks up the alcohol cabinet when my grandfather visits. I have been awake all night sweating, tossing, and turning. I am going to discuss with her a more gradual tapper plan today. I am 18 years old for christ sake! This is under no medical supervision, how is this okay?  Edit: Thank you all for the strong and rational information, It is very helpful and means a lot.  Edit: Last dose taken 30 hours before real pain started. Low dose (10xr or 15ir) a day for the last 9 months.   Edit: Thank you all, Mom researched about stopping meds abruptly and apologized, she admitted she was ignorant. I told her this was illegal and now I am going to gradually taper. I feel better now, as I took a dose this morning.

I am 42 years old an just diagnosed(epicrisis is not ready) I am on my 4th or 5th week on Ritalin. Started out with 10mg daily and now on 40mg daily.    Often I have these moments where memories and things from the past pops up and it is  clearer than before and it feels like I can make better sense of it all. I could try to give some concrete examples, but I feel like it have to wait for now. It is overwhelming, but not in a negative way. There is just so much.  Not sure if anyone understood this, but can this be an effect of stimulants like Ritalin?

I've made two really amazing and important friendships in the last year.  I met these people and just clicked immediately.  We seem to just 'get' each other.  Our conversations are amazing and we never run out of things to talk about.  What I have come to find out is that they too have ADHD.  Is this why we clicked like that?  Why we seem to think about things in the same way and have many many shared interests?  Even someone I chat with at work, I can talk to all day and I never knew he had it until he told me about it a few weeks ago.    I was initially in awe of meeting these people because of the level of comfort and understanding we had with each other.  Has anyone else experienced this?  Regardless of why, they will continue to be a big part of my life going forward.  I just find it fascinating is all.

Sorry for the rant, but I want to know how the hell do you stop yourself from hating these habits of yours?   **TL;DR: I have a LOT of really annoying habits, and I'd love to know how you deal with them, and try and stop yourself from doing them?**

I am applying for a pharmacy tech position because I: 1) want to pursue a career as a pharmacist 2) I would really find it helpful to gain experience in a pharmacy setting &amp; 3) it's a job that I can find myself staying interested in and actually doing at my full potential.       The problem here is, I never applied for such a position let alone applying for a job online. I've had multiple jobs under the table as a younger teenager, but I want to start establishing a stable career. I have no idea how to effectively write a cover letter to an employer. And I am putting too much thought into it as well that I haven't wrote a single sentence yet.        I've googled for some advice on writing a cover letter, but how do I best convey *myself*: an 18 year old boy, with a deep interest in pharmacy, with no past experience in a pharmacy setting.       I'll take all of the advice I can get for where I stand now, how to write this cover letter effectively, and how to increase *my* chances of being hired. Thank-you.

I see it everywhere, even more than the usual CBT, and apparently it helps them sooooo much. But i can't do it, it's dreadfully boring and incredibly hard. I don't feel anything, no equanimity ([Learned that word from this post, very helpful](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/4n9uou/how_i_became_a_happier_and_more_productive_man/)). No level ups or anything visual like that. What is the fucking point? It's really frustrating, i can't do something that will help me, but isn't that ADHD in a nutshell?   What do i do. I don't wanna miss out on this thing.

At what age kids are old enough to understand this condition?;;;I'm a 27 yo mother of 2 kids: 4 and 5 years old. I'm gonna bring my youngest to a specialist this summer to diagnosed (or not, but I find he seems to have the same problems I have) if the father gives his autorisation.  I will see a psychiatrist next week for a plan of medication for myself and I've been thinking if I should talk to the kids about this condition. I receive often questions such as "mommy, why you NEVER remember this or that??" Because as a single mother, I ask my kids to remind me some of their stuffs (like I need cream because my skin itshes or where are these exacts toys in the house)  Anyways, I'm not sure if they are old enough but I'd like some experiences from other parents:)
a1f16262ea83a0689dc073537ae85a18375cf03286a220ea2114d9eb3f47fb41;;;Are these emotional regulation issues ADHD-related or BPD-related?;;;I am looking for a new therapist (old psychologist did not seem to get me at all). I was thinking of getting one that specialises in ADHD (since I've been diagnosed with that by a psychiatrist), but lately I've been reading about BPD (borderline personality disorder) as well, and I relate to what people are saying about it quite a bit (unlike a lot of other disorders I've been reading about). **I am trying to determine which kind of therapist to go to first** (I will switch of course if it doesn't work out).  I guess my question is how common are the following among other people with ADHD:  * **no real sense of identity**. I often feel like there are 3 different people living inside me, each pulling in different directions. Some days I feel like I want to focus entirely on building my career, other days I just want to go out partying in a self-destructive binge, and in yet other days I just want to be entirely altruistic and focus on helping other people. I don't feel like I belong anywhere, and whatever I start doing, I want to be doing something else  * **black and white thinking**. I often become "infatuated" with a person, to the point where they are perfect and I see no flaw in them. I want to dedicate my whole life to make them happy, since they are the most amazing person ever. It gets to the point of obsession. Then they do something to disappoint me, or reject me because I become too needy and clingy, making it obvious they aren't as perfect as I imagined, and my whole life feels shattered. I tend to withdraw in self-loathing rather than lashing out at them though (unlike many BPD people).  * **intense emotional outbursts**. The way it works for me is that if something bad happens, it's as if my brain can only focus on memories of other bad things happening, forgetting any good things I may have going for me. The initial slight negative emotion spirals down uncontrollably until I start having suicidal thoughts and self-destructive behaviour. The opposite is also true for happy feelings, making my life feel like quite the rollercoaster. It is different than bipolar, since it isn't a cycle, and is always triggered by something real. It's just that I can't regulate my emotions and just say "stop it, it isn't so bad, it will pass"  **How often do you experience something like that?**. General tips on how to choose a therapist also welcomed.

This morning, I wanted to make coffee so I got the coffee container out of the freezer and did the usual making-coffee stuff like people do. But then I couldn't find where I set the lid that goes back on the coffee jar. I searched the kitchen. Knowing me and where I might have set it, I looked through the dirty dishes on the counter and I looked in the food cabinets. I found it on top of my fresh vegetable pile in the corner of the counter.  By that time though, I was already making my breakfast (of course, I had thought about making coffee so stopped making breakfast to go do that). But I couldn't remember where I set my plate with my  half-made up breakfast sandwich. Found it on another flat surface in the kitchen.   And then I wanted to have my phone so I could look at my messages while I eat and couldn't remember where I set it before I started making the coffee.  This is every day for me. It's like I'm just floating about life and then every once in awhile I stop to think about where I was floating a couple seconds ago because I hadn't been thinking while I was floating.   I always thought this was just part of my personality but now I know it's a symptom of my ADHD. I don't know life to be a different way. This is how I've always been. It blows my mind that there are other people out there who don't have to try so hard to just get up, make coffee and have breakfast. While we ADHDers have already run a mental marathon before noon.  Honestly? You know what I'm doing now? I thought about ADHD Reddit right after this realization this morning. And now, I'm here at my laptop with half my breakfast still uneaten on the plate in my lap.

Sadly I can't access the paper, but the abstract shows the results and findings. Maybe someone with access can find out more.  The conclusion says that childhood maltreatment ("emotional and physical neglect, physical and sexual abuse and witnessing family violence") is significantly associated with ADHD symptoms in adults.   This might be helpful for pre-diagnosing yourself or for any doctors looking to find further indicators.

When I picked her up in the afternoon, I was having a nice conversation with the day care owner when I spotted the bag. I said "OH! That's mine," and grabbed it. We all had a little chuckle about them wondering who left it there all day and then it turned topic into me informing them that I'm ADHD and not just ditzy and that if I ever forget something or get confused or whatever, that's the reason why.      The owner seemed shocked that I, a grown woman, was recently diagnosed as ADHD. She then said in all seriousness that I should "play brain games" to cure it.     I paused. Then I decided that I literally had no time to educate this woman on something clearly more complicated than she was expecting and just smiled and told her I was "already doing that."      And then I laughed and laughed all the way home. Sometimes you just have to accept that people are, understandably, uneducated about ADHD and there aren't enough hours in the day to take on that task. Oh boy...
5726ae8de3635b060c9a319c47a361a687b7a0541cdaddac975df8dd821780df;;;Taste in Music (or comedy etc);;;Hey, definitely don't think these things are down to ADHD particularly but just curious if there's much correlation  In terms of music and comedy and such, I tend to find myself quite different to most people. I dont like the majority of comedy and consider a 'good' sense of humour to be refined rather than liking everything. I very rarely laugh when I find a TV show funny. I tend to prefer situational humour in cartoons.  With both music and comedy, I tend to like them based on whether I agree with the lyrics/words, whether I think it is 'clever' or whether it is 'technically good'. I used to like metal, but mostly because I felt like it took the most effort... similar to classical. I was appreciating it in quite an abstract way. As such I really enjoy genre mixes too.   But as for that natural feeling a lot of people get with music or comedy where they cant help what they like, and relate to things... notsomuch. took me AAAGES to relate to stuff which was 'silly love songs' or very 'down to earth'. i had to be on various drugs to understand most dance music. music rarely ever reminded of a situation or person, unless the lyrics were very descriptive of an exact thing.  The music that my body does really go towards is stuff that I HAVE to pay attention to. quite loud stuff, quite fast stuff, stuff which hits a certain pitch. like breakcore, or babymetal, or even aqua, or just stuff that goes DUNDUNDUN on my head and takes over and you can only mime or move along. often a lot of friends cant stand the things i would listen to in a music session, even if they have 'eclectic' music tastes. they might find one of the bands clever, but they dont really see what links them together except for the ones where i simply agreed with the lyrics  i really struggle with soft music. i like plenty, but i find it 'boring'. its 'background music' and whilst i can find stuff I like, when someone wants to show me their music I get bored and tune out because I cant listen to this kind of music without doing something to entertain myself  on the other hand, with the (lyrical) kind of music i like, or headphones, i am incapable of doing something alongside like studying, or having a conversation. though the very fast bassy stuff can be good for housework.  how about you guys? anything 'weird' about your music taste?

While I recently worked very hard to get the habit of training regularly ( https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine ), eating very well, running and sleeping 8 hours a day, I still feel that I am not ready to become who I would like to become.  I am in my thirties and I am ashamed to say that I have not achieved much. I did start many things, but I am still working in a shitty minimum wage job that I hate and I cannot concentrate in order to learn about my world. I don't really understand economics, my history is lacking, I don't get science... I know a little bit of everything here and there, but nothing that allows me to understand the world the way I'd like to understand it; it frustrates me very much.  I never really did simple tasks like paying bills on time, doing my taxes... I am a mess.  My question is the following. Is there hope for me? Is it possible to become someone I like with so much bad habits? I feel powerless and I see this diagnosis as a possible salvation to get me out of my torpor. Am I too old to become more educated, to have a job that I like and am proud of?  Any similar real life stories would greatly inspire me.

All phrases that have been used to describe me.  I ran across a study that found those with ADHD/ADD were, on average, 3x's more likely to commit suicide than those without it... but for girls who are hyperactive, it's 9x's more likely.  I'm 25 and I always feel like I have normal amounts of energy, but people comment still on my energy level. I started exercising more, it took me an hour of low-intensity strength training and walking 6 - 7 miles to even feel mildly tired...  Yesterday my friend introduced me to a girl who has ADHD and is obviously hyperactive, and I was like "damn at least I'm not as bad as this chick, she is all over the place."  Later my friend and I were talking and she was all "yeah I think you two are comparable... actually maybe you're a tiny bit worse."  (She didn't use the word "worse" but still, that's how my poor bullied brain interprets it.)  Gaaaaaah I feel like I will just always be looked at sideways as weird or "taking up too much space," or else working so hard to control myself that I stop having any fun at all. I *like* to talk. I am not a good listener. When I am allowed to talk as much as I like, which is not very often, I feel amazing afterwards... but nobody is really willing to put up with that all the time. Of course not. I certainly don't like to spend time with people who talk too much!!  I have been feeling much better about myself since I got diagnosed and have realized I am not just a raging crazy person, but this is one area I'm still pretty insecure. It's really hard not to feel like you must be selfish and/or unsupportive when you have to struggle so hard to listen to people and would so much rather be talking. I lost the most important relationship of my life because of this problem. At the time I didn't know I had ADHD, so things might have been different if I could have explained, but I also find that explaining doesn't seem to help most people--they just don't get it.  Tips? Advice? Commiseration? Have you found a way to navigate social situations successfully, outlets for your hyperactivity, or places where you really feel free to let your freak flag fly without fear of backlash?

Diagnosed with Childhood ADHD and been unmedicated for a decade.;;;This may be a bit lengthy, but I feel I must provide some context.  As a child in elementary school I was diagnosed with ADHD. After some trial and error in finding the correct medication and dosage, my performance in school and behavioral problems were both corrected with near immediacy. Before treatment I was completely inattentive in class and spent my time doing whatever I wanted, which was usually being the class clown. Afterwards I was the #1 ranked student in my middle school and stopped acting out entirely. Quite an astounding change.    However, after consultation with my doctor my mother decided to wean me off my medication in eighth grade so that I would not be dependent on it in high school. Seemed a logical conclusion to me at the time and I was quite confident I could handle it. I had always been quite a good kid, never daring to step a toe out of line while I had been medicated. That year I nearly failed school, and skipped two months of class before my mother found out what I was doing. Somehow I managed to pull through with D+'s and C-'s and make it to the ninth grade. Before that year I had been the sort of child to hide anything less than an A grade out of shame.   Things went all down hill from there as very difficult events occurred in my life. My parents split, my mother lost her job, we moved from town to town, and state to state. We went to California to take care of my dying grandmother and then back to the state of CT. I couldn't keep up in school due to constantly changing classes. I had no friends because I was constantly moving, which in turn caused me to be very depressed, quiet, and angry. Cold silence has a tendency to atrophy any compassion others would feel for you. In my case it seemed to make me despised... quite a vicious cycle. We were very poor and could not afford new clothing or good food. I had a bad accident that tore one of my internal organs in half which was a huge financial burden. So after that we were constantly living under the threat of eviction. For a very long time I considered killing myself, and I never did speak to anyone about it out of fear of being labeled some sort of psycho who needs to be on watch. Blah blah blah sob story.   Fast forward a decade. Here I am today, Buddhism is my saving grace. I truly believe in the teachings of compassion, patience, and love he passed on. Since the eighth grade when I quit, I have always been a believer that medication is a crutch and I should rather spend my time sorting through my problems and resolving them without it through the teachings of the Buddha. If I cannot come to terms with my issues without it, how can I say I have truly dealt with my problems. How will I ever come to face them if I am reliant on a substance to function properly?   However I was always bullshitting myself. I never stopped medicating. I just turned to marijuana instead. After noticing negative health effects about a month and change ago due to excessive smoking, I have recently mustered the resolve to cease my use. However without that safeguard in place it feels as if my mind is running rampant. I have absolutely no motivation. The thought of taking a phone call or making plans with someone gives me anxiety and is something I avoid at all costs. Working more than a six hour shift has become hell for me. I hurt my back recently and am in quite a bit of pain but cannot afford a doctor. I legitimately consider a bullet to the head most days, and am afraid to tell anyone for fear of adding to their burdens. The few people I am close to, four, all have enough on their plate as is. I am so tired, so deeply terribly exhausted of this life and am reaching for a rope somewhere...fucking anywhere...Just something to grab onto. Maybe I should really be letting go instead..I dunno anymore.   So I have been considering trying to get back on medication. Thinking that maybe it is not a crutch as I thought it was, but something I genuinely need to function in society. However I don't know what to do. I am terribly poor, and break even after buying food, paying rent, and bills. I have a $5000 deductable for medical insurance and there is no way in hell I can shoulder that burden. I don't know how to go about even seeing a doctor about my problems without incurring great debt. I have so many doubts and questions. What are the long term dangers of medicating for ADHD? Perhaps ADHD is not even my problem anymore?  I match up considerably with the symptoms of Bi-Polar depression. What if I do go to see someone and they label me as some drug seeker and don't want to help? How long will it even take to get help? I feel like I am at my wits end. I live in seclusion now, I never talk to my family nor even my closest friends. My mental condition gets worse by the day. I don't know what to do.   I am just looking for some advice.

a8d16b6abd92015b7e5668daea5806bdd6eb14550e5cbc2daed5452ffcfceb8f;;;(Rant)Why adhd support, quizzes, etc. pisses me the fuck off.;;;Okay, I know I'm going to receive hate for this, and I really am not trying to put down anybody. However, I've noticed over many different places (like this sub, news sites, etc) that the support and ''diagnosis'' of ADHD is NOT helping the people who actually have it. Let me preface this by saying that I have been diagnosed correctly very early on by a specialist through intensive testing and examination, meaning that I actually have it. Now, here's what I need to say: THE ADHD COMMUNITY PISSES ME. THE. FUCK. OFF. Why? Well, there's the notion that ''oh I get distracted'' or ''my mind is on a million other things'' means that you have it. NO, it really, really doesn't. To the people like me who actually have this horrible disorder, it goes beyond distraction. It goes beyond being able to delay gratification. It's that we get distracted, and we CANNOT bring ourselves back. There's literally a disconnect from what we are trying to focus on. There's distraction and then there's ADHD. I've tried typing a way to describe the disconnection but it's so hard to describe. But finding a discussion for people who actually have it can be hard, because it gets buried under mountains of issues everybody experiences that get labeled as ADHD. I see ''20 things only people with ADHD understand'' and I'm like ''well now that everybody has it, it's sort of pointless and plus your video does not represent us.'' Wait shit I actually lost my train of thought because I wanted to type something else but I just can't remember anymore because I was to busy reformatting this thing. I hope this makes sense because I know it's disorganized but I need a place to rant. I know people are looking for support and I'm not doubting that you have it. But because the majority of people get a one-and-done diagnosis, I more suspicious. Again, I'm not directing any hate at you guys, I just need to tell people about this. Fuck this is disorganized.   TL;DR - Overdiagnosis has lead to people claiming ADHD is why they do certain things. To people that actually have it, it's annoying to see. Post is disorganized. Why am I even trying.   edit - I wrote this at 3:30 am so I wasn't thinking clearly. Here's a comparison of what im trying to say: Imagine you have a population of 400 people who all decide to go to Alcoholics Anonymous. Out of that 400, 300 occasionally have a drink, but the 100 left are heavy addicts who need help from AA. However, they're voices are silenced by the 300 average drinkers who compare themselves to the alcoholics when drunk. They mistake they're behavior when occasionally drunk as the same as being an alcoholic like the 100. They make lists, videos, and more for the 300 who aren't alcoholics furthering this notion that they are the same as the 100. And what happens is that it becomes harder and harder for the 100 real alcoholics to sort out they're problems, because now every has similar symptoms. This is what I feel happens with ADHD. Hope this makes sense :)

There are lots of complications involved with his academic performance, but the hardest factor for him seems to be his ADHD. He was diagnosed over a year ago and is on a "lighter" medication since my family was worried about Adderall affecting his personality. My brother is a wonderful person and excels in many things, but has never done well in school. He is great at sports and is more often than not, the best player on the team whether it's soccer, basketball, golf, or even dance. He is very social (although he has been a bit quieter since he started taking his medication) and is one of the more popular boys in his grade. I am so proud of him as a person and as my brother, but it really makes me anxious seeing how poorly he does in school. He fails at least 1 class a year since starting school and often barely skims by with C's and D's. This past year he was supposed to fail both Math and Chemistry, but his math teacher let him pass with an F. Most teachers are extremely lenient with him and give him ample time and opportunities to make up late or missing work, including turning in all missing homework from the year and the very end of the term (I've never heard of any teachers doing that for anyone in my grade). However, he just seems to purely lack the motivation. It seems like he doesn't feel the pressure of possibly being expelled from school due to poor academic performance (and we get a personal letter from the principal every year saying that they want to keep him, but it gets more difficult every year as his GPA doesn't approve). I have studied with him personally and seen him ace exams if I take the time to teach him things step by step and making sure he understands them, but now that I am away at college and both my parents are extremely busy/ never home/ have always relied on me as the oldest child to handle all things for school and their extracurriculars I am worried about his school work when I go back to college. The only help he's gotten from my parents is payment for a tutor. However, even with the ADHD-trained tutor his grades have remained poor. Whenever my parents address the issue with his grades he seems to "shut down" and escapes to play video games or watch tv rather than study for things he clearly needs to. I'm not sure if he feels that it's too late for him to even bother trying anymore (although the teachers give him every chance to bump up his grades), that he isn't smart enough (which could be understandable considering that my other brother and I have always gotten very high grades and he might feel like he can't keep up along with all the other pressures of being the youngest child), or if he just doesn't care (which would really concern me). During some of our deep talks, I've asked him why he doesn't feel the need to try his hardest when he has so much to lose because he loves his school and his school really does love him. His reply is always "I don't know" or something similarly vague and dismissive. I understand that school is so much harder for him because of his ADHD and that it must be very trying considering other things like music and sports come so easily to him, but I would really appreciate your guys' feedback from a point of view that he can relate to and experience that he hasn't had and learned from in the importance of doing well in school and methods that have helped you. With college applications right around the corner I would be so grateful for advice or thoughts about how I can reach him to try his very hardest to do well in school this coming year and that with the right work ethic, he can turn things around. Sorry for the rant, but I love my brother, I believe in him, and I am so worried about his future/college.

Personally I've always done well in school, completed my work and aced exams. Right now I'm a student at a top uni not having trouble with my work or focusing when meeting a deadline that is close (like most people).  However, I feel very absent minded and often go off track. For example when I am coding I can start thinking about something completely unrelated and forget what I was going to do just seconds before. This happens very frequently. When I'm driving I have to actively focus, or the car in front of me could stop and I wouldn't notice even though I'm looking straight ahead.  No one thinks I could have ADHD because I don't have trouble with courses.   Was anyone in a same or similar position?

I was diagnosed with ADD by a neurologist when I was in high school and was prescribed Concerta. I didn't took Concerta for more than a year because it made me feel very anxious (very shaky hands, felt like my heartbeat was higher but didn't measured it so I'm not sure about this, I just had this uneasy feeling and often needed to get out of class to go for a walk to calm myself down).    I am now on my last year of university but I'm struggling a lot with school work. I can't read more than one/half paragraph without my mind wandering off for example. I really think I need to go back to medication so I can use my full potential, and I've made an appointment due tomorrow to see my neurologist once again.    I was just diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (seeing a therapist for this) this year, so I don't want to be taking Concerta again because I feel as it will worsen my anxiety disorder. Any advice?    Does anyone here has GAD/other type of anxiety disorder and can take medication for ADD without much of a side effect that will worsen your anxiety?   What about medications that are less known to give the sides effects I had on Concerta?   Thank you to anyone replying, I highly appreciate it :)

I've always laughed it off until now.   SPECIFICS:  I look back at most of the issues I have had in my life prior to all of this and realize that many of my struggles are probably derived from this. One of these is just in general becoming a non-talkative person because I have always had trouble focusing on what I need to say rather than what I am thinking about simultaneously. It's like I have two brains going at the same time. I actually have a fucking LOT to say, but I just can't get it out because it's too much info to spit out at once. My mouth can't move that fast lol. I've set up a psychiatric evaluation, so we'll see if this is what it is. This is only one example out of a plethora of personal struggles that I have always battled with.  QUESTION: But I was interested especially in those of you who were adults when diagnosed, what specific situations you had trouble with before realizing that it was ADHD or ADD? The things you just dismissed or battled yourself with?

The doctor has put me temporarily on Concerta XR which was effective for a few weeks but is now not working for me at all.  I just started a new job and, while I can work thanks to hyperfocus, I can't communicate with people, meditate, read .etc because my mind is constantly running with thoughts. All the work I've put in to be organized and have a healthy life is falling apart due to my need for new medication.  I'm worried my depression will return because basic tasks are becoming overwhelmingly difficult again. If anyone has any advise I would greatly appreciate it.  TL;DR: Urgent ADHD medication support in the UK - what are my options?

She keeps telling me to "train it away" or "work with it". I keep saying that I can't control it, I'm not doing it on purpose and she keeps telling me to stop blaming my diagnosis because she knows other people with ADHD and they don't do it.

Medication has really helped me a lot. But ever since I was diagnosed my father's wife has been increasingly judgmental and patronizing to me. She repeatedly wants to start discussions with me about ADHD, suggesting it's a behavioral problem and something caused by my (and everyone else diagnosed with it) being "immature". It's not just that she doubts I have it, she says it doesn't exist. Recently I confronted her about this (after she sent me a pseudo-scientific article supporting her claim), and told her how telling me my mental disorder is simply bad behavior is hurtful and ignorant, and now she is the victim, even though I swear on my mother's grave I was being respectful. How do I educate her and help her realize how she can't go on like this while still staying on her good side? This is my first post on Reddit, so I'm sorry if my question is confusing and all over the place.

Recently, since I'm now able to support myself, I went to the doctor and was put on meds. This was a month or so ago. At first it was life changing. I was able to actually work on the things I was supposed to be working, instead of just the things that interested me. The only side effects I noticed was a strong lack of appetite and an urge to smoke more frequently. Now, about a month later, the effects seem to be much weaker. I can still focus more often than before, and I'm not at my pre-meds level, but I feel like I'm still way below what a normal person should be. Also, for some reason I've started having an appetite again. I've noticed that if I don't sleep as much and as well as I should, the meds seem to not work at all and I'm hungry all day.  Is this normal?

I'm 20 now, started therapy and meds last year. Things have gotten really bad lately, and I had a hunch that what im going through is not just depression. I was diagnosed with (high score) ADHD.   So I told my mom. We haven't been on great terms lately, but I had to tell her this. She told me she has it too and was on Ritalin all throughout school. We tell each other everything, and she didn't mention this!   I had to try so hard in high school and college just to get by. I have ruined so many relationships. I feel like she set me up for failure for not getting me help sooner.  I am so relieved that I know now though! I don't have to feel so useless and dumb.

Afterwards, she started getting ready as we were all going to go out. She asked me if I could go to my place and pick up two things for her: Her skirt and chapstick.  I obliged, walked over, and gathered up the stuff. I then realized that earlier I prepared some hard boiled eggs for work tomorrow, and they were still shelled. "I should probably de-shell these" I thought, so I did. Afterwards I put them back in the fridge, and walked back over to our friends house.  As I walked in the door I realized I forgot the skirt and chapstick.   So now I'm back home, writing this post. This time I will not forget them.   Its funny how small things like this are a really solid reminder of how ADHD functions.
1e4971158e89009a0cd0217c68d25ec7d84e4a1eee748fe8e3305a8db02bcc5a;;;Longterm diagnosis limbo;;;Ive always had mental health issues with anxiety depression, addictions, PTSD, intense mood swings, insomnia and eating disorders.   When I was a kid I was kind of a weirdo daydreamer, really really quiet and always humming to myself at the same time. Ive always been hyper sensitive, I remember bursting into tears when I was six because my brother and dad were playing a game of risk, I woke up and sat with them to eat my banana, and the tension and intensity of this game made me BURST into tears. This sort of stuff is regular behaviour for me throughout my life.  When I was in grade three my teacher spoke to my mom about how I was always getting up and wandering around, humming to myself and daydreaming. She suggested I be tested for ADHD and my mom took me to a child psych where I was put on a month long 'blind ritalin test' where i took a placebo some days and ritalin others, and my behaviour was monktered to see if the ritalin helped me. During this time the same teacher had taken to putting me with a desk in a school supply closet, and forcing me to work alone with the door closed in there. I complained to my mom about the buzzing in the closet, and she noticed i was always tired and sick feeliny from the meds, so I was weaned off or whatever and my mom met with my teacher who she refers to as a "looney toon" and determines that I must not have ADHD because the meds made me ill.  My child shrink told my mom I was exceptionally intelligent and bright for my age and that there was nothing wrong.  ADHD doesnt get mentioned as a diagnoses again by any of my innumerable doctors and psychiatrists. Im 27 now and have had an extremely uphill battle, dealing with hard drug addiction, alcohol abuse, and trying to navigate my mental health and nail down a diagnoses through it all.  Ive been on like 17 different psychiatric medications to deal with anxiety depressions and mood swings. Last year was one of the worst years for anxiety of my life. I moved from my hometown to a big city with my incredible partner of six years, began school for Special Fx makeup, and had an emergency surgery to remove my gallbladder. It fuckin sucked. I realized myself getting agitated in class with noise and distractions, I was exhausted from working and going to school all week and having just one day off. My emotions were pouring out of me and I began to self medicate with alcohol again after having been a non heavy social drinker for a long time. My grades began to slip, I was always hungover and overwhelmed with my wildly demanding cosmetics retail job. I went to a walk in clinic and described my symptoms to a dismissive rude dr who wouldnt let me finish any sentences. He referred me to the mood disorders clinic and within a week I was in for my first meeting with a psychiatrist to access my history. Right away I could tell she wasnt like interested in being overly supportive even though a lot of the history I was sharing was super triggering and causing me to disaccociate. I went in not wanting to start any meds without subsenquent visits, but she insisted on prescribing me ZOLOFT (or sertraline) and I do have a lot of gratitude for that.  Once I began to treat my anxiety things started to ease up and become a bit easier, I still had a lot going on but it helped me navigate my way towards graduation, and gave me the bravery I needed to quit my shitty underpaying job to focus on school. Zoloft was the most effective med I have taken and I started taking meds on and off when I was about 18 or 19. Ive had prozac, paxil, ciprolax, effexor, gabapentin, ativan, clonazepam, celexa, and a multitude of sleeping pills. Zoloft was the first one that made me feel the weight of my anxiety begin to rise and give way to ambition, motivation, and a life with less fear and more happiness.  Over the past few months Ive been really noticing a lot of ways that I struggle that the zoloft is not helping like at all. I forget important things, I forget little things, I forget everything. I have always had trouble having consistency in my life. I have no sense of budgetting and have never had extra money because of my lack of foresight. I get overwhelmed and aggrevated very easily when things arent working, or I dont understand something. I have specific little pilea all over my house that my boyfriend cant touch because its not a mess! its my pile. I have awful sleeping habits, and when i get on track i always seem to lose momentum and become distracted. I havee trichotylamania and have been ashamed of it for years. Sometimes the world is so overwhelming feeling that i literally just nap so i can give my brain a rest. My closest friend is my age, is an incredibleperson who I bonded with immediately after meeting, and she has ADHD. I was talking to her about what i was going through and she super gently and respectfull recommended ADHD as a potential diagnosis. She provided me with a ton of links and resources and prepared me for how difficult getting a diagnosis would be.   I was eating up all the material she sent me because I was having this huge fucking epiphany that I have ADHD like everything felt so relateable. some of things I eead about people and by people who struggle with ADHD hit so close to home that I couldve wrote it myself. I was hurtlingm towards dealing with this and had to wait for everyone around me to catch up. I made another appointment for a group medical visit which, for me, is every bit as awkward and uncomfortable as I thought it would be.  I spent weeks eating healthy and doing yoga, I even started running because the sweet endorphins calmed my brain for. few hours so I could get work done. I kept my research up throughout this time and def got obsessive nd hyper focussed on learning everything i could know. When my group med visit happened I brought my notes with me and while their were two OTHER people in thw visit with ADHD the psych seemed really dismissive, like he thought i just wanted an adderall prescription to flip or something. He brought up my confidential history in the meeting with people I had just met. He didnt do that with anyone else, only me. He brought up really personal stuff about abuse and then told me he thinks my main problem is anxiety. He upped my dosage of zoloft and gave me one questionaire for ADHD that we filled out together after the meeting. I found him really creepy at that time and was super angry.  I couldnt imagine suffering another day without medical support for ADHD, or atleast someone who would listen and respect me and trust my own knowledge of my life.   I talked to my friend about i and she was really diplomatic and told me that hes probs just trying to rule out anxiety as a main cause. The day I upped my meds I went crazy clwaning and decorating my apartment, but after that it was more of the same. I feel like now that im aware that my forgetfulness isnt just a quirk, but a real symptom, I forget more. I lost all motivation to exercise and do yoga, and have been sluggishly dragging myself through the motions of life. sometimes when I have to walk to thw store to get bread it makes me so overwhelmed and overstimulated that i feel exhausted from it. My aggrevation is so hard to control, but ive found if i take a lot if ainulabts like coffee and energy drinks I function like 15% better than usual.   I have a group medical visit coming up that im super nervous about because its with a new doctor and i feel like Ill have to please my case again. Ive decided that if the dont begin to diagnose my ADHD ill request a referral to a ADHD specific psychiatrist and hopefully access that treatment ASAP   TLDR; mental health stigma sucks and I wish this lack of diagnoses wasnt so stifling

I didn't want to post in r/relationships because they don't have the insight like you all do.   Basically, I'm curious how you and your non-adhd partners stay in a healthy relationship? I feel like I'm being taken for granted a lot and that I'm possibly investing way too much time and effort and money into something that's never going to change. I don't want to call this quits and give up if it can work but I'm really struggling.  I've been with my partner 1y7m, I'm almost 29 he's almost 25. We moved in together way too quickly.   Like 4 months in too quickly.  He doesn't make as much as me so I've always cut him slack on rent,  he's not even on the lease (yes I know I'm really stupid). Still, he is consistently running out of money and asking me to help financially.   He doesn't really clean or cook and I pretty much have to plan everything in the household.  I don't even think he realizes how much work I put into making sure we have a nice life. And he complains about his job and how hard it is and how it sucks without even thinking about how much I work.  It seems really ungrateful/rude.  Now I'm no saint. I have anxiety and depression myself and I've definitely taken some of my unhappiness out on him.  I started seeing a therapist and upped my meds and it's TREMENDOUSLY helped.  I don't remember a time where I've felt this ok about life personally.   I've started to ask my therapist about adhd and relationships and what's ok and what's not.  I don't think she wants to comment because she's never met him.  I've asked him and told him I really need him to make to an appointment with me but he always forgets to ask off of work.   He FINALLY made an appointment to see someone after I got angry with him and told him how I've been feeling but it isn't like I've never communicated my feelings about these issues before! I feel like I talk to him about this one a month.  It is so frustrating.    What are OK boundaries for me to make so I'm not being too hard on him with his ADHD but that don't make me feel like I'm his caretaker/being taken for granted?   I do have resources from my therapist and I'm going to look into but I'd love the perspective of people with ADHD.  TL;DR He has adhd and I have depression/anxiety I feel like I'm being taken for granted but have also lashed out at him because of my issues. I've been working on mine but he doesn't seem to be improving.  What are healthy boundaries I can make so this relationship could even have a chance?

What should I do?;;;I am majoring in computer science and mathematics, which require fairly demanding curricula. I'm supposed to graduate in Spring 2017.  My dream employer emailed me a few months ago and asked for my résumé and academic transcript presumably for consideration for an internship. But I never bothered responding because I wasn't comfortable sharing my transcript. My transcript is now *slightly* better than it was then but it's still atrocious, mostly because I wasn't even diagnosed until a year and a half ago.  A lot has happened to me within the past few months and I want to move away and start a new life. Late Friday afternoon, they called me, emailed me (again), and sent me a message on LinkedIn. They seem almost as interested in me as I am in them. To work for them would be the perfect reason to move away. So I figure that I might as well furnish my transcript. My expectations are low but my hopes are high.  My question is how I should submit the transcript. Should I explain what I've explained in this post and hope that they're understanding? Should I simply stress that my résumé is more indicative of my capabilities (which it definitely is)? Or should I not saying anything at all (unless asked)?  **TL;DR**: My dream employer wants to see my battle-scarred academic transcript but I'm not sure whether or not I should send an explanation with it.

I had it pretty bad and am thankful my parents got me help. I stopped getting treatment sometime after college.  I have been considering finding treatment again because I still struggle and have issues in my social life. I feel like I blurt out stupid things sometimes and can't follow conversations as well as I like and this causes me a lot of anxiety. I interrupt people and it's awful. It's weird but work is the only time I don't feel burdened. I'm able to focus cause I have to. It's my personal and social life that is a mess. I'm always disorganized and messy and find it hard to keep track of things.  My question is how hard do you think it would be to get treatment again? I have Kaiser so I don't know if anyone has used them before either.

Behind on rent, grades slipping, hitting myself, addicted to weed, no meds...;;;I don't even know where to begin describing how much I hate my life right now. The title pretty much hits all the main points.   I was a raging alcoholic but 3 years ago finally got sober and lived in a recovery home for a while. My dad passed away and left me some money so I was able to get a car, get my driving permit (I had a DUI a while back), move into my own place, and get back into school to pursue computer science which has always been my passion.   I started smoking weed and not taking care of my mental health almost immediately. I developed this really weird relationship with weed where I let the whole day slip away so I get pissed and flush it down the toilet, resolve to quit, then just get more the next day. I've probably spent $200 like this in the last month. Weed ravages my attention span, but when I *don't* smoke I can't pay attention anyway so I hate just sitting around not high feeling like I'm stuck in mental limbo. At least when I'm high I feel like I'm enjoying myself. That is, until the end of the day when I realize I didn't do a single thing I should have and I'm cursing myself and smacking myself and telling myself what a lazy piece of shit I am...  I need help and I need to start tomorrow. Like, no more fucking around. I'm behind on my rent because I lived off my inheritance all last year, smoked weed and barely got by in school, and never bothered to go to my 2nd hearing for my license so it expired. I was financially ridiculous and made horribly self-destructive decisions. I could theoretically make plenty of money from home if I stepped my programming game up but presently trying to focus on projects is so, so incredibly frustrating. In the end I just spend the whole day arguing on the internet, smoking weed, playing video games and jerking of. I hate it, I really do, I'm so desperate to get out of this rut.  I have an exam tomorrow I haven't studied for, a speech Tuesday I haven't started, and if my student loans for summer semester don't come through tomorrow then my landlord's probably going to start the eviction process. I know I need to make an appointment at the health department but I'm worried they won't do anything effective since I have the history of alcoholism and drug abuse. I don't abuse stimulants when I'm not drinking, in fact I have a friend that gives me Adderall here and there when we work together and I never take more than 10mg because I hate the way being too geeked makes me feel.  I just needed to get that off my chest but once again I should have been doing homework, I just sat down to do it and realized I forgot to eat and couldn't focus and started crying and wanting to hit myself again. I feel like a total weirdo and I feel so depressed about the way shit is going. I don't know how I'm supposed to take an exam tomorrow with no preparation and worrying about getting evicted. The shittiest thing is I'm an A+ student when I'm on my game I'm just really fucking not taking care of myself right now

I find throughout the day i can either be extremely hyper or extremely sleepy. My thoughts are still racing through my head, i am just not wanting to move all the time.  I know that is not exactly on track to my initial question.   Are you 24/7 hyperactive?   Do you go on a roller coaster of energy throughout the day?  and in general do you see any of your symptoms change throughout the day?

I also have severe anxiety, and I take some benzos for it. I started taking some Ritalin shortly after being diagnosed.     - So far, I take 30 to 50mg a day, and it works really well.    - The thing is, I haven't drank a drop of alcohol in about 2 years now, because I was afraid of mixing with the meds. Drinking a beer or two with benzo was fine, I've never had any real side effects. The only thing I noticed is that I was getting drunk faster. I'm not really into being completetely drunk, so it was fine, I learned how to control myself and just drink a bit.   - Now that I'm on Ritalin, I'm curious to know if I can drink alcohol. I'm talking just a bit, like a small glass of wine, or a beer.    -  **TL;DR: I'm on benzo, and I started taking Ritalin, can I have a small glass of wine once in awhile?**   Thank you.   -  **edit/update:** so I tried drinking a very small amount of alcohol (small light beer), far enough from my last dose of ritalin. I didn't felt really drunk, but sleepy instead. Not even happy or joyful (like I used to feel when I drank). It's kind of a good experience though, I was "missing" alcohol for a long time, but now that I know how I react to it, I don't want some anymore. Thank you all for your help!

Not just "kid's stuff"?;;;(will try to condense this post as much as possible)  Hi! I have a 7-year old nephew with a medical ADHD diagnose, his parents are not giving him any medication.  He now and then does things that seem like typical 7-year old stuff (testing, pushing, and breaking the limits of what is allowed by his parents) but now and then he does things that his parents (my brother and sis-in-law) say are not usual kid's stuff but part of his diagnosis. I was hoping this sub could help me understand this so I can act in the best and most constructive way the next time a situation arises.  Example: yesterday we were in the yard of my countryhouse, having coffee and snacks, when my nephew climbed up on a big, wide plastic outdoor box where I keep the sunchair cushions. I told him he is not allowed up there because his weight and bounce will eventually crack the thin plastic lid and rain will seep into it in the future.  He knows this, and then he still climbs up and says "Arknell, look where I am standing now!", grinning, which I take as a direct provocation. I tell him to get down, and he just giggles and stays up, I tell him a second and a third time while looking straight at him, then I walk over and take him down.  He climbs up again 2 minutes later, and this time I say much firmer (but not in any way yelling) "You can't do that" with my bass voice, and I grab his arms firmer when I pick him down, to make him understand I am serious. I don't squeeze his arm hard, though. I don't want to instill fear in him.  What always happens after he has been firmly removed from standing on the box is that he starts fake-crying (I know it's fake because it's the kind of crying where he peeks through his fingers and wants people's sympathy, and starts cry-talking and making up his own narrative, that he was allowed up there and that I was a big dumb meanie who threw or pushed him down off the box, basically he is lying his head off, like all kids do. Like I did at that age).  Now, my brother and his wife tell me afterwards that my nephew gets sometimes get fixated with things, and if he gets stressed and nervous as the situation escalates, it makes him want to keep doing that thing even more, which brings the situation to a head one way or the other. It can set off a crying-and-screaming spell that lasts a long time, though my nephew so far has had no tendencies of rage tantrums where he breaks things, to the relief of us all.  I foresee this may become a really frequent source of bloody noses for him on the schoolyard five years from now, if he provokes kids older than him that have no sense of responsibility or tolerance, and will deck him flat.  Anyway, what can I do to handle these situations better? My nephew can get into these mental states where a totally frivolous thing (his younger brother got a taste of lemonade before him, even though they both received their own glass), and then he rants and cries and screams in the living room about not getting poured lemonade first, for about 20-30 minutes.  I am very open for information, knowledge, and tips, I want to be the best kind of uncle to my nephew.
2d2f946de18cf0718e90a0d8a4beefd23b52230533a50c6a5986e785d38b5432;;;Hi, could you give me your advice. I can't get my normal medication in my current situation. Have you had any success with **legal** alternatives or methods?;;;Hello /r/ADHD.   I have been diagnosed and treated for ADHD for 14 years. My ADHD diagnosis has been confirmed several times by multiple psychiatrists as I moved throughout my life. With my medication I was able to get an engineering degree from a top university. From there, I was able to skip a masters and get a doctorate in less than 4 years. During my doctorate, I published 5 papers, presented at a world conference, applied for a patent, wrote a 300 page dissertation, and even found time to learn some french on the weekends. Afterwards, I accepted a job offer to work in France as the project leader on a multi-million euro project. But this was the normal me - the me on my medication.   Here is the problem. ADHD medication is highly controlled in France and the French health care does not acknowledge ADHD as a real issue. I have spent 2 years in France talking to doctors, psychologists, a neurologist, and none have done anything to help. Without my medication I am useless. I haven't published anything, my research is a mess, and my lab notebook is non existent, and i honestly feel like i am failing my current employers. I am not the same person I was.   So, with that said. I am willing to try anything to help same my job, career, and personal life having gained 60 pounds in these two years. I have heard about sleeping more or lower sugar intake but have you guys had any success with anything?Maybe no coffee? Tons of coffee? Teas? Exercise? Vitamins?  Anything at all. It must be legal, I am looking to save my job, not looking to get deported.   And please don't say talk to your psychiatrist. They have told me they cant help me.

So a few weeks back I was diagnosed with ADD and had to sort out a few affairs up at university before I was willing to come home and start my course of medication. I've been prescribed Atomoxetine and Ritalin and I'm fairly sure the issues I'm experiencing are a result of the Ritalin but.. well.. here goes..  About an hour or so after taking the Ritalin I feel incredible. Like a completely different, far more productive human being than I've ever been before. But after a few hours I feel awful. Like a true sense of rage over the smallest slightest issues. Furthermore (while I manage not to) I get the urge to break down into tears over the slightest issues as well as delving into really quite dark thought patterns. Is this common? Is it something that will fade with time?  Thanks guys  TL;DR Started taking ritalin for ADD. The comedowns are so brutal I'm not sure whether it's normal or what to do.

My therapist now has prescribed me Concerta. In school I was always an underachiever. And outside of school I struggle to watch movies, books, tv shows, play, etc. It was always a big effort to do/enjoy anything. Whether in school or in my free time. As a result, I can feel quite down about myself. Not being smart enough, being uninteresting, etc. But I'm hoping that will change. How have your lives changed for the better after your ADHD diagnosis and treatment?

I don't know why I said that to myself because when I thought about it I realized that I have made so many changes ever since I started Adderall my life is completely different since I started. I've become a totally different person and have improved in almost every way I can think of but it still feels like it's not enough and that I have barely accomplished much. Just shows that we really do crave change and it feels as though there has the be a huge change all at once. Instead of wanting a huge change though I realized that it's not one huge change that is gonna happen. it's all tiny changes that will add up to a huge change

Once you interact with him and understand how his brain works you realize it's just very extreme ADHD but a lot of people don't know what to think at first because he's off the hook.

Curious if y'all had any experience with something similar.

For example: -You have an addiction such as Internet, video games, social media, or porn. This can zap your dopamine levels and cause ADHD like symptoms. -You are deficient in vitamins or other hormones. -You don't eat healthy and don't get the proper nutrition for your brain to function properly. -You don't exercise enough. -Etc Etc.  I'm not saying this applies to any of you, but maybe it does.   Maybe instead of medication to treat the imbalances of chemicals in our brain, all we really need is a lifestyle change.  I really don't want to be taking adderall for the rest of my life. This is why I'm going to be creating a case study in a few weeks. Doing a complete lifestyle change and not taking any medicine.  Let me know your thoughts. Has anyone else changed their lifestyle for the better and gotten ride of ADHD symptoms?
db5a3bb77265c725f833d935542c60d9ae3d336e0ca0ebe10652fb436938cec5;;;Diagnosed a few months ago, only been given Concerta in increasing dosages, still doing nothing. Is it worth it to continue taking higher doses?;;;Hi! I was diagnosed with ADHD-C in late May this year, after realising I had symptoms throughout my life. My doctor gave me 18mg of Concerta to start off with, which I took for a month. It did nothing, no side effects, no anxiety/appetite/etc changes and no benefits. Then I went up to 36mg, which I finished 3 days ago - again, no difference at all.   At this point I went to my review appointment and told the (temp) doctor I wanted to change to another drug. He was like "Well I can if you want, but don't you think it'd be a shame to stop Concerta now when a higher dose might help? If you change and the new drug doesn't work and you end up back on Concerta we'll have to titrate back up". Me being me and unable to say no for fear of being judged, said ok to this and I'm now taking 2x 27mg a day (54mg, I think the 54mg tablets are bigger and I struggled to swallow 36mg so decided on this method).   Anyway, 3 days on 54mg and I still feel nothing. On the few days I've forgotten a dose that day, I've felt no different. I feel like I'm on placebos. I know meds don't help everybody, but I feel it's really the time to explore other options. This last doctor I saw has now told me GP to up me to 72mg and that "I'm nowhere near done yet, I can go up to over 100".   PS: I don't always drink, but I can have a pint of cider and feel no different to usual, also I can have my coffee each morning and still don't feel like it affects me (I just like the taste)! I avoided both of these drinks during the first month (18mg) and had decaff coffee the first half of the second month (36mg) and normal coffee the second half and I continue to do so on 54mg with no effects.  I feel this is going to take ages and I'm anxious to know if other meds can help me and I wanted people's opinions on my situation, please. :)  tl;dr: Doc wants me to keep taking an increased dose of Concerta for a month at a time rather than switch to something else, I feel it's a waste of time as it does nothing, currently at 54mg. Want to know if anyone would insist on a med change or stick with Concerta. Thanks!

I have severe ADHD, which for me mainly manifests in problems with organization (both mental and external) and focus. I also officially passed the two-year mark at an administrative office job which requires *a lot* of organization, planning, and focus.   While I've had some tough times, I'm now doing very well at my job (and even just got a promotion). I wanted to share the *actionable* tips and tricks I've picked up along the way that have made office work not just bearable but *sustainable*. If you have tips of your own, please add!   ----  **1. Establish your morning routine.**  *How you start your day has a HUGE impact on the rest of it. Having a set morning routine at work can set you up for a positive, productive day. Some ideas of what is in my morning routine:*  * **Daily To-Dos**: Before I do anything else, I write out my daily to-do list. I refer to the to-do list from my last day at work and move over any incomplete items.   * **Breakfast**: If you have appetite suppression problems like me, building breakfast into your routine can be wonderful. Now, I eat breakfast every day out of habit -- I don't have to worry about whether or not I'm feeling hungry. Plus, eating breakfast serves as a reminder to take my meds (which I never take before food).   * **Check mail**: Doing this first thing every day is an actionable step that makes me feel ready for the day.   * **Something fun**: This is so important! For me, my "something fun" is making a copy of the daily crossword in the newspaper that I work on during breaks. It could be talking to a favorite coworker, reading the paper, drinking your coffee outside -- but find something positive that is a part of every morning for you.    **2. Figure out how to plan your day.**  *Many people with ADHD have problems with both short-term* and *long-term planning. Taking the time to establish how you will plan and prioritize each day's activities will eliminate a lot of the stress that accompanies feeling out of control and lost. Everyone works differently, but here are some ideas:*   * **Traditional to-do list**: This is my primary and preferred method -- just a plain old list with checkboxes of the things I want to get done that day. Important note: *only* write down the items you can reasonably get done that day. You might not finish your to-do list every day (I often don't) and that's okay -- but don't write down items that you know aren't going to happen that day. Make a fresh one every day so you don't get overwhelmed. You'll start to learn what you can and can't accomplish in a day.   * **Online to-do lists/apps**: Some people do much better with apps or online versions of to-do lists. This could be anything from a text file to a full-blown to-do app. I use Habitica, and I like "importing" my written to-do list into the web application; being able to get the rewards satisfies my need for approval, while having the physical list in front of me keeps me on task.    **3. Figure out how to plan long-term.**  *Many office jobs require you to be able to plan ahead and do tasks on a semi-regular basis -- for example, mail this once a month, send this out once a year, etc. This can be very hard for the ADHD mind to handle, so it's important to face this problem head-on and identify problem spots. Some ways I do this:*   * **Use your company's resources**: It sounds so obvious, but it was a LONG time before I started using my personal Outlook calendar to organize my work. I had only used the company calendar as required by office policy, but I never marked my own meetings, deadlines, etc. on my own calendar. Don't neglect resources like this! In Outlook, for example, you can set reminders, color-code everything, and more.   * **Use an old-school planner**: For some, working on paper works better. Get a planner -- it can be just for work -- and use/refer to it faithfully.   * **Work backwards and set your own deadlines**: For ongoing or recurring projects, work backwards from the due date to set your own mini-deadlines. For example, if I have a mailing that goes out every 3 months, I will set a deadline for when I have to have the copy checked, when I have to make sure we have the materials, when I have to print, when I have to mail, etc. Once you come up with these, **WRITE THEM DOWN** in your preferred organizational tool.   * **If you're given deadlines, write them down**: Again, this is probably obvious to non-ADHDers, but I would so often not write down deadlines, especially other people's (ex., Dr. X is supposed to send me ABC by this date). Now, they have their own color category and I see them as they approach when I log in to Outlook. Much easier!   * **Get a whiteboard!**: Old-school? Sure, but it works! Get a small whiteboard to write down anything unusual -- one-time projects, super important deadlines, etc. Hang this right in your field of vision where you won't miss it.   * **Use Outlook's Delay Delivery function**: I cannot properly express how much this has helped me out! In Outlook, when composing a message, you can delay delivery until a certain date and time by going to the "Options" tab. If you get a message that says "Do X, but don't do it until this date," forward it to yourself and have it delivered on that date. You can also email yourself reminders this way -- just make the email subject "REMINDER: DO X TODAY" and send it to yourself. This feature is a GODSEND.    **4. Identify the guilt and anxiety.**  *ADHD can cause us to feel a lot of guilt and anxiety, especially when we're in jobs we may not be naturally suited for. It is so, so important to figure out the exact source of this guilt and figure out how to handle it. Here are some examples from my job:*   * I felt a lot of guilt about **not answering emails on time** and **constantly having voicemail to check**, so I established a "no email in the box" rule for the end of the day.   * I frequently **missed deadlines** for recurring but irregular (ex, not on the same day) projects, so I set up a double reminder system to keep that from happening.   * I felt guilty about **procrastinating too much**, so I made a plan to reduce the amount of procrastination.   * I felt guilty about **frequent therapy appointments**, so I had a discussion with my boss and worked out something that makes everyone more comfortable.    **5. Establish an End-Of-Day Standard.**  *How you end your day influences how you start the next one. This doesn't need to be complicated. For me, it's:*  * **No voicemail** and **no email** at the end of the day -- I don't always succeed but I always strive for this. If I don't have time to deal with all email, I still end the day with my inbox at 0 by using the **delay delivery** function mentioned above to forward the messages to myself to handle the next day.   * **Neatness standards** are not something I have strict rules about, but I don't let myself leave without my desk being in some semblance of order. Make sure to give yourself 5-10 minutes of "tidy-up" time at the end of the day.    **6. Let your work help you.**  *Even if you don't feel comfortable sharing your diagnosis, there are many ways your workplace can help you thrive. Here are some examples:*  * **Change your hours**: If you struggle with lateness and fatigue, like I do, see if you can move your hours back. Doing this made an immeasurable difference in my quality of work life.   * **Order new supplies**: Many offices will let you order office supplies without question, so think of what would help you. For example, my work got me a whiteboard, planner, phone headset, and some desk organizers -- this has nothing to do with my ADHD, as far as they know, but it does help!  * **Talk about accomodations**: There are many accomodations you can make that might make your work life easier. For example, I've said to my boss, "I have a lot of emails to get through today -- I'm putting on white noise headphones, so just let me know if you need me." Don't be afraid to do something differently just because you don't want to look different -- your workplace wants you to succeed and will generally accomodate your needs.   * **Be honest with your supervisor** if you can: If you're falling behind or having trouble, most supervisors would rather know that and help you fix the problem. Way too often, I pretended nothing was wrong until things were *really* bad. It's okay (and often encouraged!) to keep your boss updated on how you're doing!   **7. Get connected.**  *This may not be a problem for others, but I used to let a lot of the guilt and shame I felt over being a "bad worker" isolate me from much of the rest of my office. Feeling socially connected can improve your mood and work ethic. Here's a few things I've done:*  * If there is an **employee appreciation program** of some sort, participate as much as you can! If there's not, suggest starting one. In my office, we fill out cards if a coworker does something exceptional or helpful, and two individuals win a drawing at the end of the month. I've made it a specific goal to write two of these a week -- this gets me out of my own bubble and makes me really look for generosity and hard work in others.   * **Join voluntary groups** if you have the chance -- my office, for example, has a "Friends of IT" group that meets semi-monthly to discuss IT issues from the perspective of all departments. This will get you connected and provide a sense of novelty, as you'll get to do projects and have discussions you ordinarily would not.    **8. How to stay focused / miscellaneous.**  *Planning is important -- so is doing. Here are some ideas that may help:*  * **Use a Pomodoro timer** or similar -- stay on task for a certain interval, then take a break.   * **Mix in fun and boring projects** -- admins generally plan their own days, for the most part, so try to work on novel/interesting projects AS WELL as the boring, routine stuff.   * **Productively procrastinate**: Look, we're all going to procrastinate. Try to make it productive. For example, I will use work breaks to deal with personal to-dos, like paying bills, dealing with finances, answering emails, etc. Even better...  * **Make a list of dream projects**: Make and frequently reference a list of projects you would like to do if you have time. We ADHDers often have a lot of ideas about how to make things run better or more smoothly -- write these things down! When you feel like procrastinating, look at that list -- now THAT is productive procrastinating!   * **Write down your accomplishments**: Preferably somewhere where you can't lose them. This will boost your self-esteem and also be very handy when evaluation time comes around.   * **Don't beat yourself up**: We're all going to have low-focus days. It sucks, but try not to beat yourself up. What's important is that you keep trying.   * **Look for opportunities within the company**: There are often many opportunities to take on projects outside of what your actual job description is, and if you can take advantage of these, your work will be more varied and interesting. For example, I now run a conference solo every year and am the administrator for one of our software platforms, just because I asked.    **9. Stay positive!**  *I went back and added this, because I think it's incredibly important. Some of these are also in items above but bear repeating here.*  * **Make a list of your accomplishments** and refer to it once in a while. Even looking at a to-do list filled with lots of x-es will make you realize that you ARE getting work done.   * **Think about what you're good at** and try to take on projects that align with your skills. Don't forget that just because administrative tasks may not come easily to you, there *are* things that you excel at. If you can make them a part of your work, your mood will improve immensely.   * **5 Happy Things**: Try to make a list of 5 positive, work-related things every day. Try not to repeat. They can be work-adjacent if needed ("Saw a really cute dog on my lunch break!") but focus on things about your work that are good. This is so easy to do and it really makes a difference.  * **Know that you'll NEVER be done** -- and that's a **good thing**. ADHD obviously has its drawbacks. It also has its positives -- namely, that our minds run a million miles a second and we generate ideas like crazy. You are going to come up with a million ideas and possibilities, and you won't achieve them all. But don't let this be a bummer! Remind yourself of how much you *are* doing, and the fact that you have some perpetually unfinished items on your to-do list just means *you have a lot of ideas*. Take pride in that.    ----   **TL;DR**: Having ADHD at an office job is not impossible and it doesn't have to be soul-crushing. Keep thinking critically about what's working and what's not, and it's absolutely within your power to make your office job not just tolerable but even enjoyable.

I was undiagnosed at the time and my semesters were always a mess: was late on almost every essay, and struggled to do the workload; most assignments that weren't late were done at midnight or the morning after. I was diagnosed after college, and I'm rehabilitating from a year long injury to my back (Slipped disk, currently learning to bend my back now). I've had sparse writing gigs in the mean time, but they were always a mess.   **Event at hand** Last night I had a soccer match report to write up, and sent it in at 4 a.m., when it should've been done at midnight, 3 a.m. the latest. The editor is pretty fed up with me, he had a backup writer just in case. He emailed me saying that despite being talented, I'm unreliable, that I should think things over; if my ability to turn in work on time is such a hindrance we should part ways.  **Question to you all** I think despite any talent or ability to write, that maybe I should think about a career change. Writing requires a lot of skills which I don't seem to be suited for: I'm not able to work within a timeframe, I'm bad at scheduling, I'm not able to learn from my mistakes fast enough, etc. Are there any reddit users that are writers, or in a similar freelance position? Jobs in which you have to schedule your own projects and meet deadlines? (kind of broad and applicable to everyone I guess) How have you dealt with the demands of your job despite your ADHD?  **My thoughts on the situation and the future** I'd like to make a concerted effort to rebuild my life (for the umpteenth time), but I'm at a point where getting out of bed and taking my medicine is one of the hardest things to do (partly because of the back pain). For a more concrete idea of my life: I wake up at 9, I'm probably dressed and have eaten by 12, then I read about 20-25 pages of Game of Thrones an hour (I'm aiming for 50-80 a day), play guitar for an hour, play FIFA until it gets late-ish, go to sleep, repeat.  **My life questions I'm pondering** My low self-esteem and my current lifestyle productivity have me wondering if I should aim for something lower and in a different career, maybe just like a Starbucks Barista for awhile? Or should I take more time off and try to rebuild myself (kind of against it, lack of deadlines, the open and free time)   **Conclusion** I think maybe I need a more monotonous job. I won't be caught day dreaming while trying to think of how to think of introductions or researching information.  **TL;DR:** Not good at writing because of ADHD. Time to do something else?

d6b51a36eda7699e94298ed45753f76be931777fc0cd1f7c58cf79ef987ba9bd;;;The biggest accomplishment in my life;;;Hello everyone! I wanted to share a short story about my struggle with ADHD. I was diagnosed with ADHD around the time I was 8 years old and was put in a special education program for most of my education until junior year of high school. I always felt personally that I didn't have a unique skill set or anything that I was good at because the time it took for me to learn things. For those not familiar with special education programs is typically the majority of your time is spent in the same classroom for most of the day with periods inbetween that you go eat lunch or you are taking an elective class with the rest of the school integrated. By the time I reached high school I was asked what electives I could take and since I was a freshman and had not proved how well I would perform in a regular class I was only given 1 choice. I had spent a good majority of time looking through the syllabus and wanted to take a foreign language class. My special education teacher incharge of my education plan and had full reign over what classes I could take and had told me no. When I asked why my teacher had stated with my disability I would not be able to comprehend the language and be able to pass it at the same pace as other students. So I decided to take Earth Science instead and passed with a B. My mom had decided that we have a fresh start and we moved to Maryland. This was the first time in a long time I was not a special ed student and was able to choose all of my electives and classes I wanted to take. So of course I had taken spanish 1 which was a 2 semester class and passed with a C! Next school year I took spanish 2 both semesters due to lack of transferable electives to Maryland I graduated a year late. After high school I had thought I forgotten what I learned so I found my textbook from high school and read it. As I read the book I felt the words coming back to memory just like a song you haven't heard in a long time. From that point on I read the next book in the series and practiced everyday. Now I am in my 9th year studying spanish 6 of them studying alone. I speak, read, write and even have dreams in spanish even talking in my sleep. I even decided to travel internationally for the first time alone to Colombia, South America and continue to do so every chance I get. Although I may not be fluent I am on the right path to fluency with enough time and dedication.   Bonus: http://imgur.com/a/G3931  I tutor University students studying English as a second language voluntarily when I travel to Colombia i'm in the white shirt
d57c7672e889b22b6ceb3ab0b1be9f1f300680a79496bdc6798d7dbb1731e42f;;;Been 10 years off meds, thinking of a career change and want to see what's changed;;;So I was diagnosed at 6, which was in 1990.  Had an excellent doctor actually gave a shit and not just about the money or that my parents were bad parents.  I was diagnosed with ADD, not ADHD or whatever else there is.  Anyway, 10 years ago, I found out I can function in society without my meds.  Now, I am ready to start a new career, and I want to go back on them to see if I can do college.  The reason being that I went off them was all the warnings and stuff about heart problems, etc.  I noticed that they didn't really help me that much with work anyway.  So I can function without them until it comes to school or church, or reading in general.  The last thing I think I was on was Concerta (hopefully spelled it right), and it worked great.  Has there been any leaps in the ADD field since then?  I work nights, so I probably won't reply for 8 or 9 hours.  TL;DR What has changed in the last 10 years or so with meds?

There will be a project that I need to get done, but I will add things in front, which I will decide need to get done first.  While there might be some theoretical reason why I think the other project should get done first, on closer inspection, it isn't really necessary. It seems to be my brain's way of delaying the main project, the important one. Why? I am guessing, because my mind doesn't find the main project as interesting.  Currently, there is a home repair project that involves hiring a contractor to do some work. I don't like hiring contractors. But this needs to get done, and I can't do it myself. I have been saying that I need to do a different home repair project first, so that the job will be easier for the contractor (and in theory, cost me less money). Of course, this other project is something I would do myself, and I enjoy doing my own home repairs (when I'm capable of them)... But it's not a necessary project.  I'm just wondering if anyone else has recognized this kind of pattern in their thought processes? Before getting diagnosed, I don't think I ever realized how often I do this or how much it prevents me from getting things done.

I was reading a link to ADDitude listing Inattentive ADHD symptoms.  I'm going down the list, check, check, check.  Then it sort of hit me,  I don't remember formally talking to my son about his situation beyond stating he had Inattentive ADHD.  It just sort of evolved over the years.  I was considering sharing the article with him so he knows what we see and why we know he has ADHD.     However, being a young teenager, I can also see him using this as argument ammunition every time he doesn't want to do his chores.      "Dad, you *know* I forget things, so why are you punishing me for playing my video game and not doing the dishes?"             What are the pros and cons of having a dialogue about his condition?  What happened when you did this with your kids?

Started on XR which worked great, but was expensive and I had trouble getting to sleep at night if I forgot to take it first thing. Upped the daily dosage a bit and went with 1/2 a tablet IR, twice a day (to save money on the script). I like not going broke managing the condition and having flexibility to not take a morning dose and just do the afternoon if I'm feeling OK without it. It's been working really well.    Problem: On my latest fill, the manufacturer is Mallinckrodt and I am having trouble not turning the pill to dust when I split it. I've read that this has been a problem for others as well. The splitter I have is starting to break anyway and it was also struggling with getting a good clean cut on the Teva pills from the last fill (though not nearly as bad). I really like the Pharmacy I'm using, and the Mallinckrodt are doing the job just fine, so it feels silly to pay more or go to a different pharmacy just to get a pill that splits easier. I'm aware some swear against certain generic manufacturers based on personal experience, but for me it's doing the job just as well as other's I've tried with the same minimal side effects. So, I'm hoping some of you fine folks may have a splitter or a splitting method you can recommend that has yielded good results.    Also, I want to thank this community again for all the awesome that is fostered here. I'm not a bit sharer when it comes to my medical issues, but reading the posts here helped nudge me towards seeking help, and it has been a huge improvement for my life. So, thank you to all that do share. I'm still working some things out and refining my strategies, but having the playing field leveled by treatment has already had awesome results.

I've been lurking around for a while though, and you guys are great. Today I have a consultation with my doctor. Technically, it's to evaluate me for ADHD, but I was diagnosed when I was very young. I'm 19 now, and I haven't been on meds since I was 10.   The problem is that my mother is controlling about a lot of things and she didn't want me on medication. I took Straterra and Ritalin in the past and she said it made me an emotionless zombie, so she took me off meds. I've finally gotten her to realize that my ADHD is really affecting me and at this point in my life I want to be medicated.    Last night she starts trying to tell me that she doesn't want me on stimulants because I personally have told her I don't like Albuterol, so she's now against that. She wants me to try Straterra and Ritalin again. But this is why she didn't want me on medication in the first place! I told her that what medication I'm on is between my doctor and myself. But my mother thinks that because she's a nurse,  that she knows best. How can I get her to understand that she doesn't have a pony in this race? She's now trying to get me to have her on the call when I go to the consultation. I don't want this. But I'm on her insurance and she's very good at making me feel like I'm being a "horrible daughter" if I don't do exactly what she says.   Basically, as a 19 year old college student, what do I do about my controlling mother trying to control my ADHD medication?
bdb716b43894a8751686d67b6fbcbabf483a3c759260eff43efe10b7d5f47aa2;;;Constantly confused;;;I was just recently diagnosed last month and was prescribed Ritalin. I received my diagnosis via neuropsychological assessments (a bunch of IQ tests) and learned that I have a "superior" perceptual reasoning IQ. The neuropsychologist recommended that I use "visual" aids to study (I am in graduate school). I did very badly on the similarities test (low average), but got "superior" raw scores on vocabulary and information. Also did poorly on spelling and sounding out words. I was placed in speech class as a child so I am not "too" surprised. I was almost diagnosed with a learning disorder, but they re-evaluated the results and dropped it.  Anyway, since I started Ritalin I noticed something... When I'm on it, I don't feel as confused as I usually do. I just feel all over the place most of the time and I never noticed that this could've been ADHD. I do not understand why I am naturally a bit confused? I do not know if it's because I am distracted and am only "half" listening, therefore I am "missing" the important details (maybe).  My psychiatrist suggested that I've been operating on probably "60%" brain capacity, which was still enough to get by and do well in school until it became a "problem" in graduate school where I couldn't get by, by paying "half" attention. IDK. This is all very new to me...

It's not the taste of the food, but the texture. Most fruits and vegetables cause me to gag and sometimes vomit. I was looking into potential ways to get over this texture issue, and I came across a few articles that claim that there may be a link between food texture issues and ADHD.

After my brother and I were diagnosed, and after long discussions between the three of us, he has started the process of getting checked himself.  He has been smoking and drinking coffee for most of his adult life, and seems especially reliant in stressful situations (maybe not that uncommon in terms of smokers and coffee drinkers). I recently came to think that this might have something to do with the possible undiagnosed condition that he might be struggling with.  I have myself used caffeinated drinks extensively, and found them to be useful at times, but after starting on medication I have not found that much of a need for them.  Have any of you found a similar outcome from medicine, after being diagnosed? I suspect that coffee or smokes might not be as necessary in ones daily life if the medicine takes away the primary problem.  I hope that my father finds out about the source of his problems, and that he might find an escape from the addictions he has been trying to get ridd of.  **TL;DR**: Is it common for ADHD/ADD sufferers to become reliant on caffeine or nicotine to combat their disability, perhaps while they don't know of the underlying problem?
dcb4a5eca4100a0670699e147bdc53055ae9b9f89185afb68b743fa3423b12d6;;;Off meds for 13 months (pregnant + nursing) and I am feeling %100 confident in my ADHD diagnosis and how well the medication worked for me.;;;F/31 Currently nursing a 4.5 month old baby and have been off Vyvanse for 13+ months.  I am desperate to get back on my meds but so torn between nursing my baby and feeling like the person I'm supposed to be.  Pros and Cons list to quit nursing isn't working.  Any advice would be helpful. I was only just beginning my journey with a medicated diagnosis 3 months before I became pregnant with my son (figures, when i am finally happy and thriving i am blessed with a baby).  I chose not to continue with my meds while pregnant or nursing.  BACKGROUND:  Having been diagnosed at 30 years old after months with a counselor and one visit with a therapist, I was skeptical that ADHD was my issue.  With assistance from my counselor, I made a list of life problems that I wanted to solve and took it into my first meeting with the therapist.  Messy, overweight, unmotivated, procrastinating, obsessive binge-eater...   I was shocked that she diagnosed me with ADHD because I had preconceived and uneducated ideas of what ADHD was and thought that It wasn't a fitting diagnosis.  I resigned to the fact that I was not a therapist and had nothing to lose so I began taking the Vyvanse 15mg that she prescribed. It was like someone turned the lights on and I could see my path as opposed to stumbling around a darkened room trying desperately to find success.  I could kick myself for not going to seek help sooner.  My life had gotten significantly better in such a short period of time.  I was at the end of a bachelors degree program at diagnosis and homework that literally took me close to 5 hours to complete was finished in maybe an hour and a half.    Sex was better because I could finally be in the moment and focus on the act instead of my mind drifting to a million different places.  I wasn't obsessing over food (eating because I couldn't stop thinking about eating) and lost 25 pounds.  Those kind of results are hard to ignore now as I have gained 65 pounds throughout the pregnancy and have yet to lose anything. So with the weight gain, reoccurrence of binge eating, an unorganized house all with an unyielding internal running commentary about how Im failing at all of these things... It must be worth it to continue breastfeeding my kid. Isn't it?  Am I selfish?  The internal battle is all consuming.  Update 8/10/16: I called my psychiatrist's office today and scheduled an appt. for September 8th (the day after my 32nd birthday) and hopefully at this appointment we will discuss the possibility of my going back on Vyvanse.   Just in time I might add. My husband and I had a talk today where he expressed how overwhelmed he feels picking up my slack with the housework and our baby (he does WAY more than me and I know it).  I will keep you updated.

Second week things start falling apart, forgetting important tasks, getting harder and harder to get out of bed on time, forgetting car keys 3 or four times a day, Reddit is becoming a severe time waster, people are slowly noticing my inattention and my newly acquired set of skills are quickly faltering.  Week three I'm a wreck, close friends of mine are trying to help keep me together, waking me up, leaving notes of where my keys are. Acquaintances think my problems stem from Ritalin being a crutch/addiction and that I'm going through withdrawals, and that I need Jesus/Hulk Hogan/Booze to help me through my tough times.(Not saying those last two won't help)  I have started 6-8 projects and have gotten no more than 3-4% complete so far, I have ordered 3-4 arduino boards and 15-20 servos, batteries, and connectors for a project that is very poorly defined.   I have sent 3 order forms this week to the 3D print lab and two have been returned for not having a file attached, in fact as I write this received another email saying my print order from this morning is empty......  My skills are pretty much useless at this point as I spend more time finding and losing my notepad and pen then actually writing on it, I'm barely coping.  I doubt anyone will read this but if you did read to the bottom thank you for your time, I'm sorry this probably was very boring for you and full of grammar/spelling errors, you should probably get back to work before you get in trouble haha =).  Tldr: A telling of how the structure I have carefully and painstakingly built over the past 3 years of meds and therapy burns down around me over the last 2 weeks. Haha lol XD!!  It is humbling and obviously a good learning experience. I wish it on no one.

Currently, it's my phone but I can't keep using it in class and meetings. I've tried thinking putty, the bike chain fidget, a stress ball, and a Rubik's cube. The Rubik's cube worked the best but I can't solve it so it's just kind of frustrating.I just bought a 2x2 cube, so we'll see how that works. Can anyone suggest something similar or maybe fidgets just don't work for me?

Is it worth sticking to the relationship when he is living on the other side of the world?;;;Four months ago I fell in love with a guy while we were both living abroad. After only two weeks I moved in to his apartment and we had an amazing month together.  It was time for him to go back to America but he couldn't leave me so he bought a new ticket for a month later and we went on the craziest adventures all around the country. I have never been as in love as I am with this guy and I don't want to think about a future without him. We have now been away from each other for 1,5 months and we are planning to see each other again in 3 months. We exchange messages almost everyday and it seems like the love I feel for him is mutual. However it seems like his view on our relationship changes often. Some days he will tell me that he is falling more and more in love with me each day, the next day he will tell me it's a different kind of love and the day after that he will tell me he doesn't know how much effort to put into the relationship. This has been going on and on and back and forward.   He is diagnosed with ADHD (he's not getting any treatment for it)  and I now very little about it.  I have a very impulsive personality and I am not organized at all. Together we would get into a lot of trouble but we always knew how to laugh about it. At times it felt to me like we were trying to get into troubles just to have as much fun as possible.   1. It was really rough saying goodbye to him and I felt horrible the two first weeks without him. I am slowly getting used to it. Do you think it is worth committing to him until we meet again?  2. Are chances big that he will get tired of me if things would work out and we would start living a normal life together? 3. He says he never lies and I've never caught him lying about anything but sometimes it felt like he just told me what I wanted to hear. Is it normal for people with ADHD to lie to avoid conflicts?

New to rx..;;;Quick history, diagnosed with adhd as a Leetle Child, was on Ritalin very very young and don't remember much. Had a bizarre habit of hiding my pills and not taking them. I remember an entire desk drawer full of pills that I'd hide. Dunno why I did it. Now, I'm afraid of taking medications long term.... Relying on them, seeing I just Might Be Better with them.... But anyway. I'm an artist half of the time and work in a kitchen the other half. Other chronic illness has me struggling with physical labor, leading me into wanting to go back into art. Really, I'm wondering if pills are effective on an as needed basis. I.e, ok I'm working at home today, I should work on my comic... Pill time! Is that counterintuitive? Is it most effective to do it every day at a certain time, etc?   Tldr can I medicate as needed?

At times ive heard of people staying there for years and years and ask myself... How the fuck? Is because theyre brains regulate their dopamine levels fine?  Its very torturous for me, i NEED a job that i am emotionally and morally connected to. Its very very hard to fake being enthusiastic about a job if im not interested in it.
63ac1fba58180daad1fdc5a2dc38dd5c8a6a4cfb10c7c02ccdfe04b78330f59d;;;Few days without meds;;;So my doctor was out of town when I requested a refill of my Adderall. It took a few days to get the refill authorized, which was finally done when she returned from vacation.   Those few days at work without medication really put into perspective just how much it works for me.   I went into work and was incredibly lethargic, and was dramatically overwhelmed by my usual workload- a workload that I have adapted to while being medicated. Every time something didn't go as planned, it felt as though it was the end of the world and that I'd never overcome the setback. I would look at my task list and cringe at the amount of work I needed to do, and I didn't even know where to start. I couldn't believe I was doing that with ease while medicated. The difference was literally like night &amp; day.   It really puts into perspective just how real of a condition ADHD is for us, and makes me incredibly thankful that there is a tool we could use to normalize ourselves and our productivity.     Hope everyone is having a wonderful day.

Are meds supposed to not only help focus you, but make your brain work faster?;;;I have been diagnosed with ADD and Depression.  While I generally feel emotionless/down, my main concern is that I think depression has slowed my cognitive abilities over the last few years. My brain just isn't turning as fast as it used to, or what it is capable of.  The main issue is that I am never able to find the words I want to use to describe what I want to say. I'm always stuck looking for a word or a way to express myself. This severely impacts my writing abilities. My processing speed and everything else is just so slow.  I initially thought these were just ADD symptoms, however the medication I take for that only has the ability of helping me focus and stay on task - It doesn't lift my brain fog much at all.  Now, I would assume that perhaps my brain is just a bit slow, however I am able to tap into a certain state of mind where words and expressions flow from my brain like I am Hemingway. My brain fog alleviates soo much and everything becomes clear.  This state of mind comes when I am super sleep deprived.  If I stay up quite late, or if I only have 3 hours sleep, I am 1000x more switched on and responsive and alert and lucid. It's all very strange. My ability to process information becomes infinitely better when I am sleep deprived.  I have since read that sleep-deprivation is a quick method to alleviate the symptoms of depression.  So is my inability to find words and think properly to do with depression, or has ADD medication fixed this problem for anyone?  Anyone who has experienced the 'euphoria' associated with sleep-deprivation allowing them to think fast and more clearly, please share your experience with how you lifted your brain fog.  I hope I will be able to replicate the state of mind in which I can speak properly and think faster because currently it really depressing to not be able to talk properly in public (unless I'm sleep deprived) because I can't think fast enough to keep up and express myself.

Went to the psychiatrist's office the day before to make sure I knew where I was going (it's one of the executive offices with a communal receptionist so he wasn't listed at a specific address online or on the lobby registry). I get a bit of anxiety going somewhere new especially for something important.  I've written a word doc with all my symptoms but still paranoid he's going to think I'm an imposter as I think that about myself most the times:  &gt; "I don't belong here, I'm going to get found out!"  I'm also not the best about talking about what I think is ADHD as it is basically me. The leaving college, messed up friendships, the underachieving despite getting into good schools or friends referring to me as "intelligent." It's spooky to see how much of my life was dictated by a simple dopamine reuptake issue.  Similarly, I'm also worried if he doesn't help me. I had to wait 4 months for the appointment. At 38 I see how much time I've been forced to waste being undiagnosed and patience isn't my strong suit to begin with.  I fell like I just have to explain my life. 38 years of experience in a appointment that will last I dunno how long but a bit shorter period of time than 38 years!  As an adult, I have fatigue and feel massive brain fog and lethargy. My hyperactivity left me long ago but all the tell tale signs are there:  1. Failure of persistence 2. Time blindness 3. Must use daily planners, timers and white noise to even begin to focus 4. Left college multiple times 5. My life is just one unfinished long term goal after another 6. Obsessive video game playing 7. Impulsive behaviour and speech...  The list goes on and on and that's kind of the problem. I'm worried to leave stuff out and not get help. I'm really tired of getting 10+ hrs sleep and still never feeling awake. I'm tired of forgetting names, dates, times, events going on. I'm tired the burden I've been on my wife and the few remaining friends I have.  It's just a lot of pressure. I'm glad I'm not crazy or insane and there is a physiological and genetic reason for my issues but at the same time I want to start working on them ASAP as living untreated isn't a life I want to live.  Just curious about what others have gone through before and during their first appointment and I guess some reassurance.  TL;DR Going for my first psych appointment and apprehensive and looking for feedback of others that have gone through this.

I'm always bumping into people and am horrible at sports because my body movements just seem to be awkward. I was diagnosed with ADHD-PI as a young child, recently started meds, no improvement in cognitive skills. Does ADHD go along side with poor coordination?

This is my 5th or 6th major since starting school, and I mostly settled on it because the job outlook is pretty good.   &amp;nbsp;  That's not to say I'm not interested in CS. Or that I'm not interested in the other 5 or 6 majors I chose. On the contrary, I'm interested in **all** of them. I have all these interests in all these things, and could see myself doing a million different jobs from cybersecurity analyst to writing on psychology to busking in a foreign country. But all I want is to be *passionate* about one thing, enough to at least get through a college degree without getting depressed over bullshit classes that I don't need and won't help me.   &amp;nbsp;  I'm not big into faith or destiny or any of that, but I can't fight this nagging feeling that I'm not doing what I'm supposed to be doing. I can't "muscle through it" anymore, sorry Dad, but my brain won't cooperate with me when it hates what I'm telling it to do.   &amp;nbsp;  My guess is I'm being spoiled and setting my expectations way too high. Maybe we can't all "love what you do" and maybe that's ok. I just want to be happy and fulfilled and I have no idea how to go about achieving that. I don't even know where to start. I don't get how people have this figured out at 22 years old when I feel like a teenager taking an online aptitude test.   &amp;nbsp;  Anyways, thanks for listening. Just venting this out makes me feel a little calmer. Woops, assignment due in 2 hours, nevermind.

We change schools for better Services, she also is on the autism spectrum. Our school now has to play catch-up because they refused to give her services at her old school for kindergarten. But she's in speech, and we are starting OT. We are also implementing visuals, visual schedules, starting with one step directions and going to work our way up from there. She has taken private occupational therapy for a year now and we're going to continue that as well as 30 minutes to an hour a week at school...  We have implemented visual schedules at home. And making her complete tasks that are appropriate for her more often.  We are going to do this for a while. But I do think that we need to get an official diagnosis and maybe within the next 6 months to a year talk about medication. She has fallen behind functionally and school. And has a really hard time even with just one step instructions. She can't focus on a single letter, word, or sentence. If you tell her to pick up her shoe off the floor that's right next to her but she can't find it. And even with one-on-one assistance at school she can't keep her focus on her paper long enough to figure out where to start. She's very inattentive.  No my husband was diagnosed with hyper-focus ADHD as a child. He was treated very badly and he couldn't get himself out of special ed in rural Georgia. So even in the eighties growing up it was pretty bad out here. So he is very anti medication. But he's coming around. A little...  I have been diagnosed with ADHD as an adult but on the inattentive side. Siam working up, and saving for the official diagnosis and medication for myself. Although I do have to say the visual schedule for my children is helping me a lot too.  Is there anything else I could be doing to help her pay attention and focus without getting her too overwhelmed. And what are your opinions and experiences with medication for children around the age group seven or eight?

University, school or with doctor?;;;Does anyone have an opinion about where it is better to diagnose our 6 year old? We are in a small town but one with a major university which does diagnoses (but doesn't take insurance), through the school or with his pediatrician? Are any of these better than others? I searched the links on the side and actually asked all 3 places but none could (or would) share if there are any differences. His main problems are at home and he performs very high academically which is why I am hesitating to go through the school route. Would I get a more in-depth analysis through the university system? More advocates?
ef6f1c18e26eabdf62888ea11a675a00d9ae93b97da463b0b185ecab60c94bac;;;ADHD and IQ;;;Hi, I was wondering, when I got diagnosed for ADHD I took an IQ test also (I didn't know I was at the time), and my IQ turned out to be 112. It's considered "Superior Intelligence", but many people these days have an IQ of 110+, so I'm not really viewing it that way.   Since then, I have now been being treated for ADHD with Adderall and I was wondering, if I took that IQ test again, would my IQ go up? I have been performing better in school too, much better. My gpa in my last semester in High School was like a 3.0 or something and when I took three summer college classes (that were very fast-paced), got a gpa of 3.4 by the end of it (my high school gpa did not carry over and these were college courses, not high school ones, AND they were fast-paced, too). And it's said that in a study, children with low socioeconomic status that were adopted into middle class ones would have their IQ increase by 15-20 pts. Not the same situation, but they were getting better learning, and I have been now able to apply myself better, so I figured I might just mention that even though surface-level it doesn't have much correlation, it still shows the possibility of how IQ can change a lot.  Also, did I take an IQ test that took into account my ADHD? Meaning, that now that I am being treated, if I took another IQ test (where it would now know I am being treated for ADHD, i.e. a regular IQ test), then would I just score the same? A 112? Does ADHD tests require the IQ tests to take into account that person has ADHD, or does it vary depending on the test? My Psychologist also said that when I was taking all these tests, it would account for more than just ADHD. So, there's that too.

I've been chasing this dream since I was young and have sacrificed friends, jobs, and a relationship to try and join.   However, after 22 months of recruitment/MEPS purgatory, I finally got the call this week. PDQ due to ADHD.   It's been difficult not to think of myself as defective or broken. It's taken a lot to get here and I realize now I have put aside a lot of growing up and learning because I chased this dream. I feel condemned by this diagnosis/decision.   Anyone have any advice or had a similar experience where they thought they felt this way?

I am able to score 7 to 7.5 average on this test. http://www.cogmed.com/working-memory-challenge I dont know if it is good or bad but my friends without adhd tend to score lower (around 6)  But i have recently gotten my diagnosis and my effectiveness on studying physics has skyrocketed. Solving problems/doing  calculation has started to feel so easy.  (biology for example which is more reading based has not seen significant increase)   I dont feel like my increased performance comes from increased focus because i still struggle alot with reading theory only (mind wanderss off) and i have never had problem on focusing while solving problems/calculating.   It is hard to explain but i feel like my iq has raised atleast 20 points or something.   Because of this i have actually fell in love with studying physics again. I feel like i am completely destroying it.   Sorry for my bad english.

I'm 20F, ADHD-PI, going to University but honestly I'm already feeling like giving up (I don't plan on actually doing it, but the feeling is definitely there).   I've been wanting to try out meds for over a year now, with no success. I'm a case of "always did well in school until college". Because of that, I was denied a diagnosis. They say I should be able to get over this without any drugs since I always have. They blame things other than ADHD for my problems too: stress, negative thinking, not liking school...   Honestly, I don't even know what to believe anymore. I'm afraid drugs won't help me. As they told me, "meds aren't the solution, you have to work on your own problems". What if they're right? It might fix my attention, but it won't keep me from being a disorganized and procrastinating mess. I'm afraid it won't even fix my attention at all or give me terrible side effects.    I've been in therapy for 2 years, discussing ADHD for about 1 year. Hasn't been of any help. This isn't CBT, just regular talk therapy (I don't know what it's supposed to be called). My therapist is having a baby just now that I've reached my breaking point too.   The thing is that I'm seeing a new psychiatrist on Monday. I'm so scared of so many things. First of all, I'm scared of not being able to tell her my whole story. I'm terrible at expressing myself. My mind might go blank too, like it usually does. Or she might not want to listen and just tell me everything I've heard before. There's so much that could go wrong.    And what if I get the medicine and I just fuck it all up? I'm afraid I might. My mom told me I'm only getting this chance too.   I can't even think of studying and it's not ADHD anymore at this point. I just feel sad and hopeless. And I like what I study too, I really wanted to have a good career. Maybe I could if I "tried hard enough". But I don't think I have that kind of strength. I hate that I'm falling right into the "smart but lazy" stereotype. I may never reach all that amazing potential they said I had. The potential was just a myth, a lie, a mistake.

I like my current job, but the senior staff has passed me over for promotion after promotion, and they don't think very much of me.  I've only gotten feedback that I need to focus.  Tomorrow I'm going on Adderall.  I'm wondering if I should tell them that I've had ADHD for the past 7 years.  Have any of you ever done this?  What happens.  I don't know if they'll "give me another chance" now that I'm starting treatment, or if they'll be like: "Oh, we have a disabled guy, we can't do anything with him."

However I recently learned that the symptoms of Lyme Disease can be very similar. Does anyone have experience with how they are different? I've done some online research but I'm still not able to rule out Lyme disease as a possibility.  I don't really experience joint pain or extreme fatigue I think, though sometimes i do get really tired during the day. I know I can't really know the difference without being tested but if anyone has insight into their differences I'd appreciate it.

Miraculasly, i am sitting in a lobby of a adult ADHD professional waiting for my evaluation to start. I dont have report cards, wasnt diagnosed as a child, and my parents speek foreign language. Additionaly i managed to finish University  (3 degrees) and worked for 7 years at one place. There was a lot of reasons why I could do it, but it sounds non typical.

dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Getting tested for the third time. Nervous.;;;**tl;dr - afraid of getting tested again, because I feel people don't take me seriously. Afraid of going through a depression again.**  I am in a slightly unique situation in that I am an international student. I had previously seem a therapist as a bachelors student and it was suggested I might have ADHD. I then got tested through them, quite some time later (after trying to accept myself what it meant to be ADHD) only for it to be inconclusive. They did not know I had ADHD or was just dealing with depression. This test was a computer based test.  After some therapy sessions and some personal struggles I was able to return to a place that I was ok, and I moved countries again for graduate school. Turns out graduate school is also stressful and it brought a lot of the problems that I have been dealing with to the surface again. I again went through the school's therapy services and then it was suggested I have ADHD. I took the test through them, and it came out positive. The test was a series of interviews and questionaries (both with me and my girlfriend). Now, that the sucky part. They gave me a test that was positive but told me they can't do anything because no psychiatrist wants to work with them.  I was then referred to a specialised institution that deals with ADHD in the country where I live now, and so far my experience with them has been good. However, as they don't accept external tests I will have to be tested again. It looks like their tests are a lot more intensive. Using both computer and interviews, etc.   Needless to say, I feel quite nervous about doing this all again and in way am stuck in limbo. I am quite convinced there is something wrong with me, and that ADHD is the closest explanation to it. I also finally accepted it, which was not easy for me. My parents are more likely to say to pray it out rather than try to understand (or care) what I have been dealing with. They almost killed me once trying to pray out my allergies, so I can't really count on them for anything related to this. My girlfriend has also told me on several occasions how she thinks ADHD is a hoax, and that kids who get diagnoses ADHD are just normal kids pushed too early, live in a competitive world, etc... None of this helps me and only makes me feel more alone.  All of this makes me feel quite anxious about getting a negative result because then I would continue to feel that people don't take me seriously. I am really afraid of that. I been suicidal before, and returning to that is not something I want to, but I am afraid of what will happen if I get told I don't have anything wrong with me, and no one really believes in it, and I get no help.  Does anyone have thoughts on this? Any advice?  Thankful for reading this long post. I really appreciate any comments!

No one seems able to work out what makes 'good' or 'bad' days.  Anyway, last year I saw Sir Dave Brailsford (super successful cycling coach) - He developed a simple app to track how his riders were feeling and how they were doing.  Could we use the collective bits of focus we all have to put something together that could do something similar?  If we could collect data on exercise, diet, meds, perceived productivity etc etc, from enough people, perhaps we could produce usable data to work out the route to a 'good' day.   It's just an idea, I have no skills in programming, data analysis, but I want to be proactive.   TL;DR I think we could crowd source data to make dealing with ADHD better.
b727f19e4909dad12baf9c04a925045e0a038fde2ef447618747eec9b4e83d09;;;Running up late fees again.;;;Pretty much every time I rent a DVD (yes we still have video shops in NZ) I end up bringing it back late and getting charged late fees. Somehow I then convince myself I'll get it right this time and rent another DVD. The problem then is often I can't bring myself to start the DVD because I don't feel like I have the ability to sit and watch the whole thing. Usually it happens when I get 2 movies and expend all my limited attention span watching the first.     But once I've failed to finish it and been charged the late fee it seems a crime to return it unwatched and pay all that money for nothing. So I promise myself I'll watch the next night, and fail again and the price is even higher so the need to watch it greater and so on.   New release DVDs cost $8/night to rent in NZ, so it isn't cheap to be several days late.  And yet here I am all over again.   Anyone have this kind of problem?   TL;DR: Constantly return DVDs days late without even watching them because of lack of attention span to start, swear it off, then do it all over again.

Mine was too good to get diagnosed...;;;They noted some bad symptoms I have that could be linked to ADHD, however, they thought my lack of attention wasn't severe enough to get diagnosed. For those of you that have been diagnosed, how much does your inattentiveness affect your daily lives? How bad does it have to be in order to get diagnosed?  Me:  1. Hate driving, too hard to keep track of all the traffic, signs and at the same time driving the right way  2. Forget to turn off my stove at least one a week  3. Forget bus card, go home to get it. Realize I forgot wallet, so I pick that one up and forget my bus card  4. Often drifting away in conversations, not listening to a word I hear for a few seconds  5. Someone can tell me they strained their ankle. 1 minute later I ask her if she wanna go for a run  6. Sending a simple email can take an eternity as I sometimes just lose track of what I'm doing and have to read it over and over  To me this seems pretty damn accurate symptoms of inattentiveness. The fact that I procastrinate/sleep/browse the web 70+ % of the work day and still manage to do my work in those other 30 % seems functional to them. I'm just lucky I can use this strategy and still keep the job.  What are your opinions? How bad does it have to be to get diagnosed?
7f4e7b9523a6fc87eb64cc2a396da44fcea6bc0c1a462a67fa2c7d0ec081af90;;;Having adhd and two kids with adhd is destroying me. And not good for my kids.;;;Sorry for wall of text:  Im not 100% sure my son has adhd, my daughter is on meds but my son is doing good in school, and his doctor wont prescribe meds because his teacher, myself, and his mother didnt mark similar issues on the Vanderbilt forms.    It probably sounds like a cop out, but i hoped this forum would understand.  ADHD is, i think, killing my family.  My psychologist feels my son has ODD, oppositional defiant disorder, which according to Russell Barkley, is really just a ADHD with different symptoms.   When he was young, I used to call him the Bulldozer (only when describing his demeanor to friends or family, not to put him down).  He is very impulsive, and more stubborn than I have ever seen anyone.  And the 'likes to annoy people' is VERY strong in him.  He loves to poke at people, and when they ask him to stop, he keeps doing it... 5 more times.  AND then gets mad when the person finally says 'CUT IT OUT!"  The best example i can give is that he got up from watching tv one day years ago, got up and when walking by my daughter who was on a tablet just leaned over and basically surprised her.  Shook his hands in her face, yelled  at her.  She is surprised and kicks her foot out.  i watched the whole thing, it was pure reaction.  He was, I noticed.. geniunely surprised.  And then upset "she kicked me!".    No amount of talks, sitting him down to explain, have worked.  Well, they do work, but all they have done is wreck his self esteem, and then he still does it anyway.  And then when he realizes he was wrong, he lies to not have to feel bad about himself.  Which gets me upset, as lying is really an issue for me, I hate it.  He also is not too close with his mother, evne years ago there was a time he came into our room to say good night, hugged me and said he loved me, and then just walked out and ignored her.  Is not his fault, she is not... warm iwth him.  She isnt mean, but she is just distant.    Over the years I have lost all faith in my ability to parent, and on top of it when i tried to talk to my family about it, i would just get frustration and 'well... make a list then!  get organized!'  I would try to say that I worried that he AND I were both extra emotional due to adhd , and they would say 'hes just a young boy, they are all like that'.  I was a very well behaved boy but my mother was emotionally abusive.  Very critical, would bark at me any time I messed up at all.  I spent my entire elementary years barely speaking to no one in school, and apparently even beofre school, had my mother leave for three days and when she came back, I looked up and just kept playing.  No running to mom, etc.  I do not want to be that authoritarian and strict, just to get a well behaved kid.    But... i think my son knows that I sometimes crumble.  Todays example started last night.  at 10pm, 30 minutes late to get to bed (i lost track of time) he says "I need to get some songs on my iphone".  (his mothers old phone, not a real phone).   I ask why, he says for school.  he says he gets bored, and I was almost positive that he meant to listen to music after school, he is in an afterschool daycare from 2:30-4:30.  We end up arguing as i tell him it is too late.  As soon as he doenst get his way, he starts getting angry, and once he is angry there is no reasoning with him and if I just say 'the answer is no, end of story' then im a bad dad, etc.  An 11 year old throwing a tantrum, basically.  I still often say 'sorry, the answer is no' because I wont let him just get his way though.  And deal with the tantrums.  And then later on he apologizes, and feels bad about himself.    He asks if i will get him up early, I say I cant because it is already late to get to sleep.  But in his defense, i think i did say 'ill try' which would be my fault.  He wakes up and immediately is mad at me for not waking him up early, and is basically irritated all morning.  I ask why he cant use the wifi "we cant use that in school, just in the after school program".  I say "isnt that why you want music?  if so, just use youtube when you get there".  This is why i think he was lying to me, because at this point he paused, and it took me a few times to get him to answer, he really wanted those songs to 'listen to while going to my locker'.  his locker is 5 feet from his room, its not high school.  For some reason they now give 6th graders in his school a locker... right outside the room.  I point out that its not worth arguing over, we are now both mad, we can figure it out in the evening.    the point is that he just kept being ridiculous and obnoxious, and I got more and more angry.  We go to brush our teeth before school and I am trying to explain that he doesnt need the songs for just walking outside his room and he starts snapping at me.  It is the usual routine, he picks osmething to dig his heels on, drives me crazy, and then when i am exasperated then says 'why are you talking to me like this?'   This is after 30 minutes of biting my tongue and him throwing a tantrum.   He said something in the bathroom and I snapped.   I said.  I am NOT doing that!' but when I said 'not' I really barked it loudly, standing right next to him.  he jumps because i was so loud, like is startled by it, then leave the bathroom.  I walk into his room and he is crying, sitting on the bed.   And 5 hours later, i still feel like shit for it.  My problem is that my parents were... not very good parents.  I fear that in my attempt to be the 'parent who listens' and not just drop the hammer any time I made any mis step like my parents did, that I am too weak with him.  then I lose my temper, yell, and then i feel bad.    Although the other day he mentioned int eh car that my daughter was 'just telling me that to make me feel bad, to get what she wanted'.  I asked him how he knew, and he said 'sometimes I do it, i know you will feel bad and then ill get what i want'.    If this is normal for kids, I give up.  I have read that one kid with adhd raises the chance of divorce by 43%... clearly having kids with adhd is stressful and challenging.   Now that my wife and I separated, on my weeks there is an ADHD dad, and two adhd kids.  Its chaos.  It worse now too, stress apparently reduces executive function, like throwing gasoline on the fire that ADHD creates, and I am going through a divorce, about to lose my job, and have some other major stresses too.  i fear it is making things worse with my kids.   I cant get medication due to my high blood pressure.  I went on an antidepressant because i kept having suicidal thoughts.  And on top of it, I have ... impossible to deal with parents.  So no support network really.    Does anyone have any sort of advice at all?  I could deal with the other issues if i could just have a good day with my kids.   We have had some good days recently, but very often I pick them up and they are fighting within minutes.  My son is impossible.  I bought him a $20 card game, then $20 for a video game.  His sister got nothing.  I go to the store with her, get her a $30 lego set that she wanted (i dont do this often) and when I get home he is immediately angry "how come i didnt get anything?  This isnt fair!"  And then I am so frustrated that when i explain he just got two games, i am not very nice about it... and then i feel like shit, and he sees me as 'rubbing it in'.   It just keeps getting worse too.

I officially reveived a diagnosis of ADHD about an hour ago and I feel so relieved to finally know. I want to give thanks to all of you here, for this subreddit has been my home away from home while going through the journey of finding out the root cause of so many of my issues.  I got a prescription for Concerta and I was wondering about other peoples experiences with this medication? I haven't taken my first dose yet.   Again, thank you!

I hate relaxing so much... when i'm sober anyway, but I also really don't want to work.  I just keep getting up trying to think of anything to do but nothing feels like it would interest me and i just keep thinking of food.   It's a pretty frustrating loop.
06415b8f93523dedd19a0f17d4b32355f2b72d48e1847a287a9fa19672758d50;;;I don't know how to cope anymore;;;I finally reached out to the counseling center on my campus this semester.  I've been struggling a lot since starting college, and people close to me have been nudging me for a long time to try and get a diagnosis and assistance.  Last year I had mentioned to my doctor that I was struggling in school and constantly stressed/upset and someone close to me suggested I might have adhd that had never been diagnosed.  He kind of half laughed at me and just said I was in a hard major at school; study more. I had good grades in high school so there's no way I have it.  This made me feel really stupid and kind of made me dismiss wanting any help.    I started off this semester with planner in hand, and by the end of the second week I was spending the majority of my time sick, crying and stressed.  That's the point I knew I needed help; but my family is very against mental health issues even existing that I'm afraid to use our insurance somewhere.  When I went to the counseling office on campus, I just explained that I have trouble focusing/finishing anything I start, and that I make myself sick stressing over the work.  I've been going there for 2 months now, so I'm at the end of the free help they can offer.  I was told at the final session I was lazy, unmotivated and needed to get a tutor or switch majors and my stress would go away.  I guess I just don't know what to do from here.  I'm even more upset since reaching out for help, and have had some really bad times since.  I can't believe that I was told that since I've only been struggling grade wise since starting college, I'm just being lazy.  I tried explaining that it's not just my schoolwork, but even hobbies that I can't focus on and that's been a habit my whole life.  In high school it didn't affect me as much since I could finish my work in 15 minutes.  My concerns seemed to be ignored because I'm seen as well behaved, intelligent and happy, but I feel like my life is falling apart and I can't take it any longer.  Tl;dr: College sucks. Please send me photos of your pets.

First we tried concerta (i don't remember the mg), then vyvanse, then adderal (this did work... For about an hour then never again), pro vigil, new vigil pretty much everything at the time. What did work didn't work very long and never worked again. From what my Dr says I metabolize the medicine to fast. Does anyone else have this problem?
c37352c8296d00314988b041fd70a9f479ee607aeb0228a3d54f000e597b71e5;;;A win! Finally something good happened in class today...kind of.;;;TL;DR: Got C on a test that the professor thought I would ace. Professor called me into her office and asked if I had "concentration problems" and told me not to worry about my grade, because she knew that I understood everything from my performance in class.  I just got my first test back in an engineering class that I am taking and I got a C. No, this isn't the win part, because I thought I aced it. After class, my professor called me into her office and asked if I had concentration issues, because for all of the problems she could follow my work about half way through then have no idea what I was doing. The professor called me into her office because she thought that I was going to ace the test as well, based off of my performance in class and was confused with my C. She told me not to worry about my grade, and that we would work on a strategy to combat my test taking anxiety. She also mentioned that she makes the final decision on peoples grades for the semester, and that if I kept up performance in class, that I would do fine in her class.  First time having a professor approach me about my ADHD/ test taking anxiety. I was already planning on speaking with her, but her contacting me just made my day. I do get extra time on tests, but I was trying not to miss my next class so I decided to take the test in class because I was very comfortable with the material. She's letting me take the next test in a separate room and she says that I can get up and walk around the room if I need to relax a bit.
153ba21eefa1a89d6bdd05e74dad3fe0c15705a0fde7036c9dc7ea0737964959;;;My younger brother is suffering greatly from motivation issues ... mom won't do anything ... any advice? TL;DR near the end;;;Hello, everybody. I've been lurking for a while and I gotta say the people here are wonderful, I've gained a lot of insight on myself. However I'm lost in regards to my family. Maybe someone here can give me advice or at least some input, I'd be grateful. This been worrying me for too long. I may be a bit exhaustive but every detail I share is mportant. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I'll write a tl;dr at the end.  To begin with, I live with my mom, I support her and my brother but I have school and a job so I can't be here 24/7. It has been half a year since my ADHD diagnosis and I've been dealing with it effectively, with fantastic support from my friends no less. I have a brother six years younger than I and he is currently in high school. At his age, I lacked self-awareness and I was always in a bad mood, though not to the point of anti-social behavior. I was smart but methodical with everything I did and that translated to a sluggish learning pace. I was misinterpreted as being 'slow'—much in the same way as one might say about a mentally deficient person, to put it politely. I was also not articulate, I could not understand and express myself correctly. Any trouble I had went unnoticed by the school and I'm pretty sour about that. It was obvious that I needed help. Anyway, a few times I mustered up some form of hope, and asked my parents if there was something wrong with me. They assured me I was just lazy, my problems were normal for everybody, and emphasized that I needed to grow up and try harder. I believed it to be true and I felt hopeless, I didn't want to make any effort to better myself. I withdrew myself from the outside world and succumbed to video games and the internet as an escape.  Time seemed to stand still, nothing changed, until this year when I was diagnosed and I began a transformation. I became a very responsible and loyal person, eager to do hard work and help my friends and family with anything. But the first and most important aspect of my change was that I was finally aware of all my problems and was able to figure out how to fix them. Since then, I've been growing at a steady pace. I can say without a doubt that my diagnosis has been the single most important event of my life thus far. This brings me to my brother. As I mentioned in the title, he is exhibiting the same behavior I once did. He isn't really aware of his negative attitude and as a result doesn't have many friends. He's always in a depressed mood, it seems worse than I ever was. He gives up too easily as well, whenever anything is even a slight challenge. He is too dependent on our mother, that's our only difference. I was doing everything myself at a young age. I won't get into details because it isn't my place, but he is coddled like a baby and it had lead to a toxic entitlement from him. He expects everything he wants to be given to him. He expects everything to be solved for him. The most unhealthy aspect of that is any time he is questioned, no matter how mundane, he quickly claims lack of knowledge.  "I don't know," is his answer to everything because he refuses to think, even for a moment, especially if he isn't under pressure. Even with the simplest of concepts it seems like he he doesn't use his brain. I'm not trying to mock him or be mean, I just need to demonstrate how severe it is. Here's an example. I got a new desk and had the opportunity to change the layout of it so that I have privacy. My brother and I share a computer room and everyone has to pass through to get to other parts of the house. His computer screen is in view as you enter. Although he doesn't look at anything inappropriate he still deserves privacy. So, he was jealous of my layout and expressed that to me. I told him if he wanted to move his desk he needed to do it himself. It isn't hard at all, it's just a mess and he needs to clean up before anything else. His first excuse was that he wouldn't be able to do it because it is too hard, and he needed me to help him. I suggested he try the easiest things to start with and immediately he refused. When I asked why, he stared blankly for a only few seconds and then answered with, "I don't know." I asked if he even put any thought into the question and again, with the same gaze he answered, "I don't know." I paced myself so as not to get frustrated. I explained that I wouldn't give him the answer to everything and that he needs to actually put in some thought. As I waited, his vacant expression tested my patience. He didn't acknowledge me after a minute, so I asked him if he was listening. He proved that he was by reciting what I told him, so I had faith he was just thinking. I asked if he had an answer to any of my questions. Can you guess what happened next?  This is a serious problem and I assume it stems from his lack of motivation but also from the atmosphere he is provided with. Our mom coddles him like a baby every day even though he is in high school. She recognizes that she shouldn't, that she should stop, but hasn't changed whatsoever. I am the only person encouraging him to be independent. I know very well how hard it is to have no motivation though, from anywhere, be it internal or external. I am trying to be patient with my brother but it's been an arduous trial for me. Sometimes I make him feel bad which I instantly regret and apologize for. I feel like when I do that I'm mirroring that same lack of empathy my parents displayed when I was younger. I've been spending as much time as I can helping him hands-on with school and chores. I always give him a chance to learn and improve. I never reveal the answer, I force him to think, to use his brain. But I haven't made any progress so far.  I try so hard but I'm only human, I have needs and I can't dedicate all my time to him. With all this in mind, here is the BIG ISSUE.  Mom's extremely impressed with how much I've changed following my diagnosis and treatment. She's far less stressed out because I help her everyday, which I didn't do before. There's much less burden on her now and she recognizes it. Regarding that, I've been pondering whether or not my brother has ADHD. I've put a lot of time into researching ADHD for my own vices. I once read that it is hereditary with a high chance to be passed down—an 87% chance if I recall correctly. But that's not my only reasoning. He suffers from everything I did, motivation most importantly but also concentration. That's what makes me so sure, and so afraid. I love my brother more than anyone could know so I've been hounding our mom to get him help from a specialist. At first she refused to even listen to me. She didn't think he has it but eventually I got her to see my perspective and she agreed to do something about it.   It's been two weeks now, she hasn't been busy AT ALL yet has made no attempt to follow up on her promise. I went through it with her just a few days ago and I learned the process is actually very simple. I don't know if I am nagging too much or too little? She also thinks nothing will come out of it, because years ago the school had these specialists ask him a series of questions. She says they would have known if he has ADHD. I think that is wrong and a grave mistake to make, as he goes to the SAME SCHOOL I DID. I'm afraid the school's knowledge on the subject of ADHD might not be up to date. And if that is the case, then how could they provide an accurate diagnosis? This is what my mother doesn't understand. I also think she doesn't realize how detrimental ADHD can be, too. I know there are some that deal with it just fine without any medication or even any help, and that's great. I was unfortunate to be affected heavily and suffer during adolescence. But my brother is still young, he can enter adulthood with the help he needs and deserves!  tl;dr my younger brother in high school might have ADHD, I know because I see my past in him. My mother doesn't, and feels it isn't worth the effort to get him checked out. I help him every day to better himself but I can't spend all of my time doing so and I believe he'd be better off with medicinal treatment anyway. My brother has severe entitlement issues and I think getting treated could allow him the motivation he needs to be independent. I'm afraid the school he attends could be ignorant on the subject of ADHD  So my questions would be the following: Does it sound like my brother may have ADHD? Should we trust the school faculty to accurately diagnose him? Would we be better off with a private doctor? The school is public so they hire government workers. Not that anything is wrong with that, I'm just afraid they don't have enough funding and don't care, you know? Does anyone share a similar experience to me? What are some ways to help my brother with his dependence? What are some ways to help my mother understand the severity of all this? Am I wrong in anything I'm doing or thinking?  I sincerely thank you all for taking the time to read, it means a lot to me. I'd love to hear what any of you have to say, no matter how bluntly honest you have to be. I appreciate honesty, so don't be afraid to hurt my feelings. Cheers.

If you missed that one.. I am ADD.. was diagnosed in 3rd grade (1994) and we seem to know more now than we did then. Like I am actually wondering if I am a combination of ADD and ADHD now. But anyways..  ..Well, I made an appointment with a Psychiatrist.. waited a month for said appointment.. and finally I reached my day in his office! I was feeling all sorts of things including anxiety and worry (Which if you know me at all.. that's me daily).   He prescribed me with Vyvanse for now and see how it goes and kinda go from there.   I am working towards having the proper medication which it seems like I'm well on my way in that respect, but also I want to become recognized by my college with having a learning disability and maybe begin counseling for issues with depression and anxiety.  Also, I was wondering if those of us here that are college students with ADD/ADHD do counseling via school counselor in the students with disabilities office? Or are you going to a Psychologist outside of your college? I think what I'm wondering is what all the school does/can do for you. I recently made a visit to speak with someone and they gave me a form for the doctor to fill out basically, but other than that I don't have any experience with what they can help with.  I have read that many come up with a school plan and a medication plan. While, I planned on coming on with a medication plan via my psychiatrist, I was wondering how to go about coming up with a school plan.. as far as studying and staying ahead since it would take me longer.

I've been bartending for the past 4 years and was DX a few weeks ago. I've been on 20mg IR 2x a day for about a week. Yesterday I took a 20mg about a half hour before my shift (430) and I felt fine for happy hour and into the beginning of the dinner rush but around 9or so I felt the come down and I was super moody and somewhat angry for the remainder of my shift. Any tips from fellow service industry folks? I'm going on at 6 tonight and I was thinking  of taking my last dose at 545 so I can get the kick around 6.   It just sucks that it wears off right around the time that we get our late night rush but I don't want to redose at like 10pm and be up all night.

This is, of course, a standard ADHD refrain, and we all know it isn't true, but when I keep dropping zeros and whatnot it's very discouraging.  I've prepped a lot, and my score if fine but could be a lot better if I didn't make so many damned silly errors! Does anybody have any tips for avoiding this sort of thing? I can keep myself on track and on task normally and have found systems to reign in my working memory, but this has me very frustrated.  Thanks a ton, pals ~~~
770babbc5a2f7abfd03fded318cce31651031e444eccc62d7d8665521fb83f77;;;Saw a new doctor, he wants me to do a 5 day EEG?;;;So, I stopped taking my meds (adderall) about a year ago (after 8+ years on them) to see if I could function ok without. Of course not! I'm a disaster! I booked an appointment with a new psychiatrist (old one not taking new patients, which I count as now), and just got back from the appointment.  He wants me to do a 5 day at home EEG to check for seizure activity. Wha?  My SO actually has epilepsy, with complex partial and grand mal seizures, diagnosed since we started dating, so I'm pretty familiar with this stuff. I know absence/simple partial/complex partial seizures can manifest as "zoning out" and cause memory issues... But I've never heard of doing this in relation to ADHD treatment. My SO only did a 3 day EEG, for actual epilepsy with obvious seizures!   He said he wanted to do the EEG after I talked about how my SO's seizures were affecting my sleep, and I'm wondering if it would have come up if epilepsy wasn't discussed?   Has anyone else done this?  Dr. says insurance will cover it 100%, so I guess it can't hurt? The EEG company is supposed to call me in the next few days to schedule it. Should I just go ahead and do this? It seems excessive, but I am not a doctor, of course..

I'm very creative and love to create stuff. Except my ADHD decides that it will make me feel horrible each and every day. When i start a project i think to myself "I'm gonna finish this!", i'll think of all the cool things and while i'm doing everyday activities i'll think about what it will be like. But what happens is, if i'm lucky i'll actually work on the project and work on it for a day/week and then i will either, 1. Finish it but it's all sloppy and not even 30% done. 2. Which basically always happens, i'll forget about it and when i see it i'll think "Oh cool." and never work on it again. This repeats basically every week and i am sick and tired of it. School doesn't help either. I get home at 4:20pm and put myself to bed at 10:30pm. But to me time goes by a hour every minute, making me very mad and sometimes hitting my table. It also doesn't help thinking about how i will never ever make any difference. I'll never make a hit game, i'll never make a good song, i'll never try. Sometimes if i get homework i'll just shove it in my desk so i don't have to work on it at home giving me more time to work and fail. I don't know what to do... I know you guys will be like "Oh, just train yourself" but that doesn't help. It actually can make me worse because i'll know that i can't even try to do that because i'll fail. TL;DR: I can't finish projects, and when i do they suck. Time also goes really fast. What do i do?

The way school is is not a one size fits all, and that's pretty obvious given how many people learn differently, not just people with ADHD. Given that so many people seem to have ADHD, why not create a new system?  For example, when I think of lectures, I think of them as the most inefficient and boring way to teach someone with ADHD, or someone who learns better visually or through doing. The professor speaks too slowly for us to focus on what they are saying, because we are thinking "WE GET IT, MOVE ON", and zone out, then miss the parts that we don't get or do not know. We may take more time to understand a topic and instead of being able to understand it, the professor continues and we get lost even more, because we focus on the frustration we feel about not understanding that last thing... the rest suddenly seems useless to know.   This is just one example, but a solution : If any of you are learning something that is on Khan Academy, youtube, or if your lectures are video recorded, I would suggest viewing the video at 1.25-1.5x the speed. It keeps things interesting. It also allows you to pause the video or rewind to allow yourself to understand.   That's just one example, and I think the most important one given that a teacher/professor talking in front of a class is what Post-Secondary Education is majorly reliant on.   I would love to start a discussion about what an educational system that focuses on people with ADHD would be like, and current tips or tricks that you can share that would change how we learn in our current system.

My doctor has recommended Strattera, but I have been hesitant based on anecdoctal reports I've found throughout the years online (specifically side effects - which is something that one has has to push through)  I'm not going to bore you anymore with my personal 26 years of struggle with this disorder, but I'm just looking for anyone who has found success through their use of Strattera - specifically related to ADHD/PI.  Thanks very much.
fb26a441ca9319fc07d8a138421b1651e29e81d75a39d5aae30fe15a8f37ae8d;;;It gets better;;;So I find myself awake at 6:30 in the morning and on this subreddit and I see how much some of you guys are struggling and I wanted to let you guys know that it does get better.  I struggled with undiagnosed ADD all my life and I think depression was a big side effect of it. Now, at 21, I've spent the last 2-3 years battling with psychiatrists over inconclusive tests and have heard the words: "Well...you *might* have ADD but I'm not sure enough to prescribe stimulants" at least 8,000 times.   This week, after a particularly bad couple of weeks, I visited my (new-ish) psychiatrist whose dumbfounded by the fact that I sleep normal people hours for normal lengths of time yet I still struggle with focus, attention, and fatigue despite being by all accounts a relatively intelligent person.   Psychiatrist looks through all my old test results and basically says my former doctors were full of crap and that if I was comfortable we should try out some ADD medications to rule it out or confirm it. So I walked out with a Vyvanse prescription a year after having my Adderall script taken away from me after my doctor passed away.   I've never used it before and will for the first time in a couple of hours but I'm already in a wonderful mood because someone *believes me*. It might produce horrible side effects and not work but I know now that it's not just me out there. I have someone on my side.   And so do all of you. This subreddit has been like a safe haven for me over the past few years even though I've rarely posted. So for everyone out there who is like me and can't drive for the life of them, or read more than 10 pages without getting frustrated or lose every important, small item- It gets better. We've all been there and we got through it and you're going to get through it too. You just have to hang on and do the best you can and no one should ever fault you for your condition.   TL;DR: ADHD sucks, treated or untreated but you'll always have this subreddit to vent to when things get bad. Stay strong, awesome ones!

I tend to stare at something for a long time and daydream more. I feel too hyper and too productive(?) that it makes me more tired and sleepy.   I have innatentive ADHD btw. 18 years old and diagnosed at the age of 4.
599550e8a7381c3d43c0c84765e94dfa72fd489ddabc74d4cb8646cc67395978;;;My ADHD makes me a sucky driver and it depresses me;;;I need my meds (Vyvanse) to be able to drive well. I'm not an awful driver by any means, I've never been in an accident. It's just that without my meds I can't do it well.  When I take my meds I have an internal thought process going on of like "Okay I just got on this road is my next turn going to be a left or a right? Left. Okay I should start working on merging into that lane." I feel in control and I'm a really good driver at controlling the car and my speed and being aware.   When I don't take my meds, I can't do this. I forget about merging until it's too late and I get frustrated and can't seem to take in what I see in my mirrors unless I stare. Which isn't good when you're on a highway.   The good thing is, I can identify that I need my meds to drive. And I can take them when I have to drive. Bad thing is it takes 30-45 minutes for them to kick in. I don't take my meds daily- only on days with classes and/or work. So if I have somewhere to go last minute I can't just pop one and go.   The thing about this is it just makes me so upset and feel like I'm so out of control. My boyfriend is always telling me things when we drive (not necessarily in a mean way, just like "Hey you're too close to that car") and it makes me want to cry. I try to explain it as like, it's when you are trying to move furniture and you just can't pick something up and you're just absolutely physically unable to do it. And he understands, but he still tells me things to keep us both safe. Which I understand. But it just reinforces my own insecurities I have about me driving. How can I cope with this?  tl;dr I'm not an awful driver, but without my meds I'm sucky. It makes me feel out of control and makes me really upset. How can I cope with this?
ec92aed97ef74ebea4759e28c162398b8fe497f82d8c4394026cf2506738b098;;;Condescending Supervisor (vent);;;I want to start off by saying that I LOVE my job and cannot imagine working anywhere else. Recently I was promoted to a specialised department that requires A LOT of research, data entry, and customer service via phone/email. I love a good challenge but I'm having serious communication with a recently promoted supervisor which has never happened to me before.  Aside from my attendance (chronic migraines) I have never had to be coached in my ability to do my job, probably because I'm a diehard perfectionist haha. But lately this supervisor has been very condescending about HOW I do my job, rather than helping me understand the new information(why). She will ask me things like, did I even read the notes, you need to try it yourself, etc. I've been there a few years so I don't know why she treats me like a newb.  With my recent diagnoses of ADHD-innattentive type, I learned that my biggest weaknesses (like way below average) were omitting words, choosing between accuracy over efficiency, auditory and visual processing... Which really explains my complete and utter mental exhaustion after o get home, I have to invest my entire self in to not doing poorly.  So yesterday, I went to her for help and after going back and forth a few times about an email/follow up for something she said I never did, I just gave up and went back to my desk. In my mind, I was 100000% sure I did it. But, I double checked anyway. Turns out, I had made a draft of an email within the allotted turn around time and never finished it which means I got distracted with another task and didn't finish it. Ugh.  So I went back to her desk, apologised, and explained what happened and why I thought I did do it. I also told her that I know it is a problem for me sometimes but I was taking care of it through ADHD testing and hopefully medication soon. I also made it clear I knew it wasn't an excuse.  Her response, "ok, I guess it's fine in this situation but YOU need to be a little more diligent about the tasks that we give you." So I said okay (sarcastically) and walked away. If I had an issue with dilligence, my boss would have brought that up a long time ago. You can't get away with anything where I work.  Anyway, thanks for reading my vent. I'm still trying to wrap my head around this whole thing. And work is like my second home in a good way, so it just really sucks that I have such a personality conflict with her.  TL;DR- I forgot to press send on an email that I drafted two days before and new sup told me I needed to be 'more diligent' right after I told her I haven't been treated for my new ADHD diagnoses.
9e447c0b01a3bdbbe4958adb4b0e183bbcd9dfd79d572dd81e728df9109f2103;;;A nice story for once;;;So I go to cooking school and am in a team of 4 people working with the rest of my class in the restaurant kitchen if my school. Yesterday was a complete shit show at our station on the part of another member of my team (who has a language barrier but no known adhd) and I while the two neurotypical members were serving customers out front, without them to support us. Chef gave us shit during service and held our team back after class to talk to us further.   I have mentioned my ADHD to one of the two neurotypical members of my team in the past and she has been non-judgmental about it. After yesterday we got talking on Facebook and at first she was saying things like "you can't blame everything on your ADHD" and "don't use it as a crutch", and my first thought was "don't you dare fucking judge me without having lived in my shoes!" but I calmed myself down and made an effort to educate her as she is really a nice person who I like, reminding myself of two things: 1. Never attribute to malice what can be explained by ignorance, and 2. (a personal rule of mine) When you feel strongly about something, plead instead of threaten.  So I told her "Please please don't say things like that without trying to learn about it first. You don't understand". And we kept talking about it, and lo and behold she shared an "ADHD simulator" YouTube video with me, and then later an article on Additude Magazine about a well-known ADHD chef!! This made me cry from happiness cause I was *not* expecting a seemingly neurotypical person to actually take the time to try to learn and understand me and my issues and I told her so and sent her hugs and thanked her. I feel better about the whole situation now.   TL;DR: Not all people are assholes who refuse to listen to us and learn about us! Faith in humanity (somewhat) regained!

Lately I've been finding myself distracted again even while on my meds. I've only just know abou my condition since probably the 3rd or 4th semester of college. My doctor pulled the ole tske these and you'll be fine routine. I'm at a loss at how to organize my life. The balancing act has become too difficult to manage and I'm looking for some advice from people who have dealt with this longer. Now I've most likely had ADHD for a while and it's gone undiagnosed , but now that I know I have it want to manage it proper. Is there anything that you find particularly helpful for managing daily tasks? I've tried sticky notes, app, personal planner, etc. With not much luck. How do you manage? Also since my diagnosis I find that I have sleep paraysis as well.
72e5fa58bd6d1d9f0b32518bc3391856d4dfc4ec605b7298e991e710be24a801;;;As a result of my ADHD I can't recognize that the way I'm acting is a result of my ADHD.;;;I had a huge fight with my now ex girlfriend one day when we were talking and a song I enjoyed came on the radio. Without thinking about it I turned up the radio because I was distracted by the song. This understandably offended her because she was in the middle of talking and when she asked why I turned the radio up I didn't understand why it was such an issue because I checked out and thought she was done talking.  We argued for the rest of the car ride because I thought she was done and she knew that she was in the middle of a sentence. It was until about 20 minutes after I realized it was obviously because I wasn't on my meds that day and my ADHD got the best of me.  I don't get offended when someone yells "SQUIRREL" at me or makes some other ADHD joke. It makes me feel more human actually, I really enjoy it. But I think if people believe their mental disorder isn't well understood or appreciated they should try living with ADHD because I just assume nobody will understand or care if I say I have ADHD.  Having ADHD has ruined parts of my life and I haven't even realized it until now because I couldn't. It can be an extremely severe condition and nobody feels any sympathy when you say you have it because nobody understands how damaging it can truly be.
eb42021ccaa5990215abb649644bff0f5818edb4dd6fb4a974153d15b1d3fde2;;;Going in for a diagnosis. Question about cannabis;;;Hello all,  I've browsed this subreddit for awhile and am posting for the first time today.    A little history: I have had many symptoms of ADHD all my life(lack of focus, procrastination, zoning in and out when people are talking to me...you know all know them) I went for a diagnosis a year and a half back.    I was honest with my psychiatrist, I smoke cannabis occasionally, rarely drink(one beer in the last two months).  She wasn't sure if I had ADHD or anxiety and prescribed a generic Lexipro.  That was NOT for me.  That moved to Wellbutrin.  Which did nothing.   Her residency was done and she moved to Hawaii, and I was told someone would take over for her and contact me. .  That never happened.  I really didn't feel like she listened to me(her supervisor came in, and while she gave a recap of what we went over, I had to correct her on some major things in my life).  So I went about a year and a half with out seeing anyone.  It has gotten to a point where I am struggling at work more so than before.  I set up to meet with another psychiatrist, and they said it would be 1-2 months until an open appointment.  They had a cancellation for an appointment in a week.    My main concern is that if I tell them I smoke, they are instantly going to think I am just out to get drugs from them.  And if I tell them I don't, they will require a drug test and see that I do.    How many of you got tested upon a diagnosis?  Regularly tested?  I am aware most ADHD prescriptions are a schedule II drug.  So admitting to smoking will most likely make any doctor hesitant to prescribe anything for it.  It helps me unwind and forget of the struggles I am having during the day.    I googled the doctor I am going to see, and the one review on their says that the patient was labeled a drug addicted because he admitted to smoking.  I am going to cancel and wait a month or two until another opening is available(hopefully for a different doctor).  I enjoy marijuana, and it's nice after work.  Illegal in most states(I am in WI), but I consider it like having a beer after work.  Harmless if not abused.    Assuming I have this(it does run in my family, little brother has it), am I stuck between a prescription or weed?  Sorry if this is jumbled, I am an adult in my early 30s with a career that I am seeing an increased workload, responsibility, quotas.    I appreciate any insight on this and am happy to answer any questions.
585ba3481a0cd81e4264aa6f2dab87ddb94b6a4fcaaa2953f9c1d7bb0a527a9c;;;How do you describe your situation to others;;;I've just been diagnosed, although I think it's affected me for most of my life.  I had no idea what these things were that were really negatively impacting me.  Anyways, I told my Dad about it last night and really struggled to convey what ADHD really is, or how to define it, other than saying I feel like my brain is in a fog and it'so hard to focus and I'm very forgetful.  Like many parents of people my age (30), they were probably hit over the head with ADHD talk when I was a kid.  So he didn't really understand what it was, or think it was that big of a deal.  And I'll admit, I didn't really understand what it was either when my therapist first suggested I might have it.  So what did you guys say to friends/family when you told them?  I have some great friends who are very understanding, but I want to be able to explain this properly.  Thanks!

Taking Strattera without having eaten causes me to completely break down. Feel dizzy, super tired. Taking it at night often has me waking up after a few hours with a racing heart or high blood pressure or something like that (I can't really identify for lack of comparison).  I now take 40mg twice a day because 60mg is too little and 80 at once basically knocked me out for 2 hours after taking it.  To avoid the side-effects I don't take the meds on time because I don't eat regularly enough (i.e. i took my last pill 12 hrs ago but I'm still in bed and haven't had breakfast so I'll have to wait until i've eaten which might still be another 2 hours...)  Anybody else experiencing this? Ideas what to do? My doctor is an unhelpful jerk.

Most of the time I don't want to believe ADHD exists, but looking at my life and comparing it to others, the way they work or have relationships or stay with their hobbies I can't help to notice that out realities are quite different.
cc2fb6608bd20ac6014d43b368b631c7758733b1d4d08b72a42057b60af9e63e;;;I need some GOLDEN advice here.;;;Hello all. I'm ADHD comorbid with conduct disorder according to doctors. I have many other co occurring PDs developed due to the undiagnosed ADHD for so many years. I'm a total loser. Or so I thought. I have always wanted to have things, be successful, be liked, but I just can't do it! I cannot do it at all. Corporate rules frighten me, I cannot even control my impulses. I stand no chance at life at this point. I'm as low functioning as it gets and it sucks. I not only want my material values met to my expectations, but I want these expectations to be made through me. Not someone else. But I simply can't make it in this society. I do not mean to be dramatic but this is the conclusion I've subconsciously come to due to years and years of failure confusion and internal chaos. Doctors are still considering BPD DPD ASPD SPD and so much more due to my manipulative lustful nature. I don't know when I'm actively conveying thoughts or projecting what I want someone to see onto them. And then of course neither do my doctors. This is hurting the full diagnosis but I simply cannot help it! The only ambition I have is to have ambition. I'm not someone who enjoys being useless and taken care of. In fact it brings me too much shame to harbor. My mind just races and races it never stops ever it's not human like I am I need to sleep but it doesn't. I can read full pages of books and not remember a word of it and I can play video games in a zoned out state. My mind has utterly no focus power. I can't beat this world. It hurts so much. I want to beat it I want it to be a good time but I can't and it just isn't a good time. My whole life since kindergarten I've compulsively stolen, lied, manipulated, and been in pain. I'm still not 100℅ sure what has been manifesting in my mind and neither are the doctors. I've tortured animals suddenly a few times through my childhood and even right up until 17 (18 now with urges to keep doing) but I hate it! I'm a good bright and brilliant person underneath I can feel him I know he's there! But I can't unleash myself. I feel so impaired and helpless. I'm at the point of questioning my reality and having bad disconnections from reality as most people know it. I cannot control my emotions or actions and I certainly can't get a stable life going. I'm so lost I just want to scream and cry but I've internalized so much that I just can't. There's a lot more to this story but I always look over details so please feel free to ask.  Ps: I apologize for the messiness I can't help that it barely makes sense

6c177b11f78d4ae955d9f4fda10311f210d42818bf313372b4a1264926dce298;;;What means accepting that you have ADHD for you?;;;When I was diagnosed, at age twelve, the psychologist told me I wasn’t accepting that I had ADHD and I should work on that in therapy. I thought this was ridicules, I was accepting it but it didn’t change anything. Everyone has something to deal with, I had a little harder time concentrating than others, so what? I still have to live up to the same standards as anyone else, it isn’t an excuse for anything. I was doing fine in high school because it was easy as hell, so for me there wasn’t really a problem. I did not want any extra time on tests, if I get the same diploma as these other kids I will have to do it the same way. I took the meds, forgetting them half the time, to keep my parents happy.  Because I didn’t see any problem therapy was useless. I was a very manipulative girl, I knew what to tell the therapist and what not so she would tell my parents I was making great progress and I didn’t have to go anymore.  Now, 8 years later I will be getting therapy again because of depression. I’m taking antidepressants for a while now and I want to get off of it. I have signed up somewhere that’s also specialised in ADHD in adults, and it got me thinking. I don’t think I ever accepted having ADHD, but I have no clue how to accept it or what acceptance even looks like.   I came to this conclusion because of lurking around this sub and getting close with a guy who also has ADHD (I never really talked to anyone who also had it). He was only diagnosed a few years ago and he described that feeling of finally understanding his symptoms. I noticed that I hold him and all of you here to other standards than myself. If anyone for example describes how hard it to start something, I don’t your lazy. But I do think that of myself. I also feel like taking medication to help me study is cheating. However I would never think less of my friend for taking Ritalin. I still feel like it doesn’t excuse anything, I have never sad to anyone I’m sorry about this result but this is a little harder for me because I have ADHD.    I don’t know what accepting it means, I know I’m not doing but, but I have no clue how I could. On the contrary, I am accepting my depression. It something that can happen to anyone, it’s not my fault and I will overcome this. Maybe because the depression will go away and I’m pretty sure I will have to deal with having ADHD forever.   I will definitely bring this up in therapy but I was wondering what some of your thoughts are on this?  TL;DR: I don’t know how to accept having ADHD, what does accepting it means to you?  I do not mean to offend anyone by this. I think you are all very strong being able to recognize and to deal with the daily struggles that come with this while keeping your chins up.
ac3f4511a055cb77009992408c12e28603eb9a7e3f886bbc69862a6a04389b02;;;I've finally found my passion that's ultimately guided me into becoming disciplined and motivated :);;;After having decided to go into the medical field, I started volunteering at a hospital. I just did my first couple days and it's changed me completely! My role makes me feel so important, and I love seeing the genuine appreciation in those I've helped. It's truly heartwarming and has inspired me to always go above and beyond in everything that I do!   I've always been a person of giving. And with so many opportunities of helping others, I've definitely reinforced that part of me.   It's been such a fulfilling duty at the hospital that I am truly overwhelmed with joy and love what I do!    Just before then, I was diagnosed with ADHD. This diagnosis has helped me to focus to improve on my weaknesses and really put a conscious effort into self improving. I really emphasize on having an intrinsic desire to continually work towards what kind of person you idealize as the kind you want to be.  It starts with your imagination there. Ask yourself questions to things you're unsure about and answer them to the way you'd like things to be. Then set yourself to go for it!   I've never been happier with my newfound passion of giving to others and with advancing in my career. And it's also been my outlet for stress.    I've finally found what I love and I hope you do too. It all started in changing my attitude and being as positive and warm as I can, at every opportunity!   Also, by continually stepping out of my comfort zone with confidence. Do everything you do with confidence, and if you don't think you have it then force yourself to bring it out of you. It's there if you make it there. And it's one of the key steps that has rewarded me so much in self improvement!   I would love to hear your stories! What are some of your aspirations in life, and how do you plan to achieve them?

I have stable periods and rapid cycling mood fluctuations, which I'm managing OK at the moment although are difficult with stress making them worse...and I keep making my stress worse, this is why:  I used to be able to concentrate, focus, and be productive with ease. I have an academic writing job and my doctoral thesis 1/2 done and I'm running out of time. Since the onset of my bipolar I have great difficulty focusing, concentrating and an increasing (although at times better than others) psychological aversion to it. The procrastination has become chronic no matter how much I want to do my work. I leave it last minute, ruin my sleeping pattern, and get stuff sent in by the skin of my teeth. Even when I've had plenty of time to do it in advance!  I've begun to, now that it is really urgent, take Modafinil almost daily, especially now I'm in a more down patch so energy is lower and it's even worse. It helps me enormously, I think it also helps stabliise my bipolar mood swings and makes me feel generally more normal. I still can struggle but once I get focused I am OK on it, even if it's last minute and in bursts. I am also better when I am hypomanic *if* (big if) I manage to focus long enough on a task to get into it.  If this just a chronic procrastination problem I've developed due to years of struggling with depression and mental health before my diagnosis or does this sound like it could be ADHD? I was never like this before, I was mentally very clear, adaptable and able to focused. Could it occur with onset of bipolar (manifesting after trauma and around the average age for it to get worse, in my mid twenties).  I also have a million hobbies, books, craft projects etc that I've started and not got further on. I get really into wanting to do something, do it for a brief period, then get distracted by next thing. Repeat ad infinitum.  TL:DR: Have developed severe issues with procrastination and concentration I didn't have since my bipolar disorder kicked in. Could this be ADHD or is this impossible as I never had it before? Modafinil helps loads, which is a bit amphetamine-like.

In the night, I take 200 mg Lamictal/lamotrigine, omega 3 and b-vitamins (supplement for my vegetarian life). Diagnosed with Bipolar type II and ADHD (the combined type).  With lower doses of Concerta, I've felt tired, bodily fatigue and such, but my psychiatrist doesn't really understand these symptoms/can't explain them. On these lower doses I also haven't really "felt anything"/my ADHD was practically the same, just a hard time with my appetite for a week every time we upped the dosage.  I recently went up to 72, I could finally sense the benefits of medication. My mind has somehow decluttered itself. It's only been a couple of weeks and not to jinx it, I hope this works out! But I keep hearing about people having trouble with falling asleep on these meds, but I somehow have the opposite effect? Like today, I took my medication, ate some food and read some comics and then fell asleep on the couch, gone for several hours!  I've tried to look online on anything about this effect but I can only find articles on problems with lack of sleep. Does anyone of you know how this effect is produced? Can it be an interaction with Wellbutrin or anything else?  tl;dr: I feel sleepy on Concerta. How does that work?
c0b0fce428c929bbc3db5ad353eae8877d13a9d3c9277980a01728c7c94520c5;;;Hyperfocus/perseveration and medication: is it a problem of under- or over-stimulation? On meds, I can see it happening, but can't stop it. Off meds, I don't notice it until I've stopped. Any advice (for both on and off meds)?;;;I recently got diagnosed with ADHD-PI, and the meds are working wonders in my life. I pretty quickly got up to the max dose of Adderall XR that my psych was willing to prescribe (I'm unclear if 30 is a hard limit, or just the limit she has for me for the first "round" of prescripting) and when I went back, I explained it's working very well except I'm noticing hyperfocus on it. She said that's probably a sign of over-stimulation, but it keeps getting worse the longer I'm at this dose, and some of my other symptoms are becoming more apparent - notably, daydreaming, distractibility, and anxiety.  So now I'm trying to get a handle on what my "hyperfocus" actually is and if it's a symptom I always have dealt with, or a symptom occurring on the Adderall only, so I can discuss it estimate with my psych this week.  I've always struggled with "getting lost" in something to the point it consistently makes me late, because I massively lose track of time. It also makes others feel like I'm ignoring them, because I often can't put down my phone or book until I've reached a satisfactory stopping point in whatever I'm reading. Up until recently, I was calling that procrastination when it got in the way of me doing productive tasks. Now I think it's actually perseveration/hyperfocus and I just didn't have the right context for it.  While on Adderall, I seem to still have it, but it's like I can see it happening. There's two parts if my brain going at once - one that won't stop when I'm doing something, and one that is watching the clock going, "hey, if you don't stop now, you're going to be late to class again, which is ridiculous because it's a 3 minute walk from here." But no matter how much the logic yells at the focused part, I can't tear myself away until I'm already late and get that adrenaline shot of "you're going to miss the quiz or attendance now."  So I'm mainly looking to see if anyone else fights with perseveration even if they are recognizing that it's happening. If so, have you found a way to help with it?  Also, when I'm not medicated (in the evening for example) and unable to notice that I'm hyperfocusing/perseverating, does anyone have tips for my husband? It drives him up the wall. When he can't get me to stop doing something, but I can't find a way stop.  TL;DR Is it hyperfocus/perseveration if I know it's happening while I'm doing it? Im trying to figure out if my issues are under-stimulation or over-stimulation from Adderall. Does anyone have tips for dealing with perseveration (off meds) that might help my husband get my attention where it needs to be?
dd5f43ed535f74ebf9199fd2c0d6981379ed7329c30694b0179df8a670fde162;;;Internet addiction?;;;So I have ADHD(probably -pi, maybe combination, undiagnosed though that will hopefully change), and for the past year or so I have noticed that I get bored extremely easily.  Like...if I'm sitting without some kind of mental stimulation for 5 minutes I'll be already getting bored out of my mind.  And lately I've found that I'm getting more and more dependent on the Internet as a sort of self-medication.  The time only passes quickly if I'm online, whether it's binge watching TV shows or browsing Reddit/Facebook/Pinterest/Tumblr/etc...  I don't have really any hobbies...just moved cross country to a small town and there isn't a ton to do besides school.  I've never been into sports or crafts or anything like that.  I've started filling as much time as I can with going for walks to try and compensate, which is obviously better for me than being online all day, but still, it doesn't take up as much time as I want it to.  Problem is, whenever I try to sign up for things that will give me fewer hours of downtime, especially in late afternoon/evening, I end up hating it and wanting to go back to idling away.  It's becoming hard for me to stay stimulated when I'm offline.  It's literally one of the only things that keeps me from getting bored.  I get stir-crazy and madly impulsive, like 100x more than usual if I'm bored so I try to avoid it because I hate the feeling.  Any suggestions?  I feel lazy and unproductive and my concentration in school hasn't been great because it's hard to really focus on anything.  But I can browse Pinterest or YouTube for an hour, easy, without even noticing that time is passing.  Why can't I apply that focus where I want it?

Sudden restlessness/anxiety out of nowhere!?;;;Looking for people who have had similar experiences/some peace of mind! -Have OCD and ADHD   -Taking zoloft 75mg and adderall 10-20mg  -Was drinking ~2 cups of coffee and recently stopped cold turkey  -As of a few days ago, getting super internal restless/anxious (dont know the difference) feeling out of nowhere, usually around night time  -Thought maybe the zoloft was too high so I decided to go back down to 50 mg  -The restlessness has been bad enough i've been using ativan to try to calm down, did that tonight, hasn't helped!  -Havent had these symptoms for like half a year, and now they're back!  -Don't get to see my psych for another two weeks, desperate for some comfort: why might this be happening? what might help? anyone else out there experience this?  tl;dr: sudden feelings of restlessness/anxiety i havent felt in months, only things that have changed include cutting out coffee, reducing my zoloft by 15mg thinking that might be the culprit, looking for some comfort/answers until i can see my psych :(   thanks you guys!!!!
f14625273134b73896901b95121f382ccf23cec8e1858eae7946791270ce73b1;;;ADHD, Extroversion, and Friendships;;;I'm just wondering how universal it is to struggle with friendships with ADHD. I found several posts talking about the struggle for introverts, but any extros out there with the same experience? How do you cope? I'm not a bad friend, I enjoy being there for my friends, but I tend to attract toxic people (maybe because ADHD is toxic?) who don't stick around for long. I don't have any friends that I regularly communicate with that I've known for more than 8 years, and most of the friends I've known for 8 years (since I've been in my current town) have slowly dropped me. I've never been part of an "inner circle," and the few times I've thought I was I've learned the hard way that I was wrong. Pair that with rejection sensitive dysphoria (just learned that term today and omg I can't tell you what a relief it is knowing that's part of my ADHD!) and I've had a pretty rough time. I've often been told that I'm "high drama," but at least one person in my life has acknowledged that I come at it backwards - often by trying to avoid drama, I end up creating it. And it is definitely NOT the drama itself that I enjoy (I've known a few of those!), but before learning more about ADHD's affects on behavior I learned bad thrill-seeking habits that tend to lead to drama. Anyway, anyone have advice on finding and keeping (non-toxic) friends? Especially overcoming the whole rejection dysphoria. That is a serious friendship queller and just makes life absolutely miserable. I am friendly with a couple of my coworkers but I'm constantly nervous that I'm going to eventually say the wrong thing or let them see the dark side, which tends to scare people away. Should I just be frank and explain to these new friends that sometimes I'm not a great friend and sometimes I totally lose my mind but it's okay it's just the ADHD? They're aware of the diagnosis but I'm not sure they *get* it, and trying to explain it in some contexts just sounds like making excuses, especially when I share a workload with them. The worst is that I'm a shy extrovert, and tend to drink a lot in social situations because I desperately need the human contact but I'm terrified to say anything until I'm a little lubricated, then I start having a good time and stop paying attention to how much I'm drinking, and then the next thing I know I'm making out with some rando in the bathroom. I don't go out anymore because I scare myself, but I try to invite people over to my house where I feel a little more in control. Anyway, sorry for the ramble. I'm sure many of you can relate to the non-linear rambly part anyway....
253f85cef8d100b9e3ab3362c44f0ff5b448b4dbc7ed4d797de8e8c9534e2299;;;Sometimes I want to be single;;;Right now I really hate my relationship.   I REALLY need to plan obsessively and stick to it and my SO is *constantly* derailing it through no fault of his own even. Everyone's SO likes to have fun with them I presume. So today he talked me into playing video games when I shouldn't have to. I love that game and with my poor self control I just gave into it. I starting to think I either I want no SO at all or an SO who's a strict disciplinarian and will not enable me no matter what, and if he knows playing video games is bad for me in the middle of the day he will never suggest it.  At night my SO likes to cuddle up to me and that's distracting as hell. He cuddles up so far that I couldn't friggin lay flat. One night I refused to cuddle and the next day we had an argument. I have insomnia and i try to set a strict sleep schedule for myself to wake up at 7AM everyday. It's working well lately then BAM tonight insomnia hits again. It doesn't help that I was stressed and thinking about my homework problem. Then RIGHT before bed my SO surfing the internet and was like "hey look at what Wikileaks came out with today!" Or "you HAVE to listen to this this is awesome!" Then he wants to have sex. Bedtime sex is something most couples do and honestly we don't have many other convenient times to have sex, really. I can't reasonably say no all the time. Except sex makes me hyper awake.   What ends up happening is, I hear the music through his headphones (he put it on extremely high volume), even if I didn't want to. Or I was already thinking about that Wikileaks thing even if I never intended to hear it nor did I want to think about it. I saw his screen EVEN THOUGH I have a no screen policy an hour before bed. I have so many problems and I can't control my SO's habits because well they're his. Sometimes I can convince him to stick to my strict regimen even though deep down I know it's unfair to him too because if he followed my regimen he would not be allowed to surf the internet or have a screen anywhere I can see it. I would have ban sex before bed because that usually leaves me wide awake. Our sleeping time would go from 9PM-5AM. I will refuse to watch a movie if it starts after 7 PM. I will never go out after 8PM. He refuses to live like that.  We compromised and decided we'd wake up at 7 everyday. Except he's unhappy and REALLY wants to wake up later on weekends so we can go out at night. That just wouldn't work for me. I can't even articulate how shitty that would be for me. The schedule has to be RIGID and 100% consistent or my circadian rhythm GOES OUT OF CONTROL. I know myself best. And I know that my rhythm is an wild beast that freaks out if I give it even a little bit of leeway.  I don't know what to do. As much as I'm frustrated with him and taking it out on him a little bit I know it's not his fault. I have to wake up at 7 AM (not because I have class. But because I MUST keep up this routine no matter what) regardless and it's already 245 AM and I'm awake because of a variety factors, some of them because I can't prepare for bed the way I'd like to due to him. I know it's perfectly reasonable for him to expect to have fun with an SO and not have so many restrictions but I DO need to have them. I don't know. I'm frustrated and stressed and chronically sleep deprived and my career is in MATHEMATICS, so I have to be in top mental form everyday. I just want to scream. Maybe we won't sleep in the same bed anymore. Maybe we'd never spend the night anymore so I can go to bed how I like. Maybe even when we get married we'd live in different wings of the same house or in different houses. Maybe it's easier just to break up. Thing is I don't imagine most normal guys will put up with a girl like me, but if my SO isn't fully compliant with my system then it makes me so tired and angry (at the world because of sleep deprivation) that it ruins it all. I don't think relationships are for me but sad though it may sound I think I'd rather be single for the rest of my life and never go out and have fun at night then continue to live life like this.

TDLR: I have terrible emotional control and am looking for advice to maintain my relationship.  I am a 26 y/o male. I was diagnosed with ADHD last year (25). I've been very successful in school and work, but I struggle to maintain close relationships. I do not have many close friends, and I become a burden on everyone that I've dated.   My mom recently told me that growing up, every time I was upset, I would fume aggressively (terrible emotional control) and ex-communicate them for a few days, completely shutting off. Then I would resume as if nothing was wrong a few days later.  This is happening in my adult romantic relationships. I read too much into things that don't exist - for example, when my BF doesn't respond quickly via text. I know he is busy at work logically, but something randomly sets me off and I go on a long rant about how upset I am, or I become passive aggressive. I know he cares deeply for me, but I attempt to push him away (?) and cannot control the emotion that appears.  Almost all of my romantic partners have left me because of this. I want to change, but when the emotion pops up it's so difficult for me to think of anything else. Are there any articles you can suggest, or books, or advice you can give to help me? I want be stable emotionally....and provide support to my partner so he knows he can rely on me.

There is no efficacy on CBT helping in ADHD, but I would like some personal anecdotes of people who've gone through it.  Personal ways &amp; mechanisms you've used to increase your wellbeing, emotional intelligence, memory, productive output. Share them!   This is a pretty saturated topic, I know, but I wanted to get some fresh responses on this. It is always good to go back and take a look at the basics of how everyone is dealing with it. Hopefully we all learn a thing or two out of this.
290bc362e181dee884fc8b4a7b2e85f0c25bb4d651f7ac5d5204192a3a4e55ea;;;How does a doctor verify you've been diagnosed by a psychologist?;;;I tried a ton of google searches and browsing on this subreddit but I can't seem to figure out how to find out the answer to this question other than just ask.  After a pretty long process of testing and sessions, I was given an official ADHD-PI diagnosis last week by a neuropsychologist, and was told to go see my primary care physician and ask about treatment options.  Therapist also said something about papers and asked if I'd prefer to receive them by mail or e-mail, and I said e-mail and gave them that.  Okay so, now I have a doctor's appointment scheduled in a few days, but the thing is I still haven't received that e-mail.  I had problems before when asked if I wanted a receipt for co-payments, and I just said to e-mail them to me, but never received them (I have an easily misspelled e-mail which worries me).  Anyway, my question is do I need whatever they're supposed to send me in order to get a prescription?  This has been stressing me out for a couple days now, and I guess I need to know if I should be calling the place back to make sure it's sent before the appointment, or if the doctor can just look it up some other way.  Sorry if this seems like a stupid/basic question I should already know the answer to, but I really just have no idea how it works, and nearly all the posts I've seen deal with people who were diagnosed and prescribed medication by the same person.  Perhaps if I'd done a better job researching I could have avoided this problem, but I pretty much chose the best ADHD-specialist person based on online ratings I could find and went with them and what's done is done.  Anyway, I could call my psychologist and try to make sure they actually send it properly, but I'm worried I'll end up calling and then I still won't have it (I also checked my spam folder it's not in there) and this whole thing will become an even bigger pain in the ass.  So does anyone know how this needs to work?  **tl;dr: diagnosed with ADHD by psychologist, need to know how the doctor gets proof of this**  Edit: In case anyone was wondering, I talked to my doctor's office and they said I come in and sign a release form and then they'll be able to get my information from the psychologist's office.

I was diagnosed with ADHD last year and started medication later that year. It's literally been a huge turning point in my life but I'm still struggling to come to terms with and get over all the anxiety, depression and self-hatred I'd cultivated in myself from never being able to be like other people. I'm really proud of having gotten my diagnosis and with the help the medication has given me I'm finally persuing a degree in science which is something I never thought I'd be able to do.  Now to my rant; I'm just so tired of dealing with people who obviously have no idea about ADHD making crazy and often, insulting claims. There's one aquaintence of mine who is especially vocal about how ADHD doesn't exist and that we're just medicating our kids so we don't have to deal with them being kids, etc. I just don't know how to deal with that kinda stuff you know? People like this person especially aren't worth the time and effort of trying to correct them and I've proceeded to block her posts but it's hard not to take things personally when you see someone in your life insisting (not to my face mind you) that your struggles aren't real and that you're medicating a fake condition.  Anyway, thanks for reading guys! Feels good to get that off my chest.

Reading all your amazing stories gives me hope.  I'm a 23 year old medstudent (f), now in my second of six years of medschool. I almost failed my finals last year, which was the point where I started questioning whether there might be something wrong with me. I got diagnosed with ADHD a few weeks ago and tomorrow will be the day I get my meds. I read all these amazing stories about how it was just as "putting on glasses", but I'm scared that it won't have the same effect for me. My therapist tries to prepare me by describing it as "getting a cane but still limping". I'm just so sick of procrastinating, feeling worthless and like everyone around me is better at literally everything. And I still feel like it's me and not my ADHD causing all this, but I hope it will go away. Will it go away? I need some encouragement...  Tl;dr - I'm afraid my meds won't work as well as some people say they do and I need some encouragement.  Thank you, guys!

I'm currently a post-grad student who although has never had much difficulty with academics is struggling at the moment. I found that I breezed through my undergrad which brings me to the point where I am today.  I've been really struggling this year and it's not so much because of the content, I don't really find what I am doing abstract or difficult to grasp. I'm struggling a lot with my memory especially under high anxiety situations, for example, today I had a clinical viva exam and up until today I felt fairly confident in my ability to pass, however, when I got into my exam room (it was a face to face exam) everything disappeared from my mind, I missed crucial, simple and important details and I am pretty sure I have failed this exam, it's the first I have failed and because I've been struggling with my memory for the last semester it has really disappointed me.  I've also been struggling to get my words out effectively and in a logical sequence, I'm generally an extremely introverted person, I don't socialise much and I don't go out of my way to get to know people. I'm starting to think this lack of social outlet is beginning to take it's toll on me in that I know how to think, but I don't know how to talk (if that makes sense). I've been hurt a lot, so I generally don't really let people in all that often.  A few years ago I was diagnosed with adult ADHD (I'm 29) and never really took to the meds. I decided to self-manage my symptoms which worked for a time. Now I am finding that my ADHD is really starting to impact every area of my life, my memory, missing important details (my degree is in audiology, so now that I'm pretty sure I have failed my exam, I've lost a lot of confidence in my ability to effectively treat patients), my thoughts have become muddled and even more so when I need to talk. When I talk it sometimes feels like my brain goes blank and I lose all meaning of the words that I'm saying to the point I forget what I'm saying or I don't know what I'm saying. I'm also having difficulty keeping my mind focused on the important aspects of what needs to be done, for example, thinking about the time instead of making a correct diagnosis and incorrect long term patient care.  I realise I have to go back to a psychiatrist and try medication, I'm so worried I'm going to fuck all of this up and I really don't want to fail, right now I'm not meeting my potential.  Can anybody relate to any of the symptoms I have described?? For example, the muddled thoughts and the problems with thinking while communicating?? Or issues missing simple, yet crucial details in work they are doing?? Or anybody who has struggled academically, not because the content was difficult but because the issues with memory, anxiety, focus problems prevented you from completing work effectively and correctly??  What did you guys do about it?? Thanks in advance

What Do You Do About It?;;;I’ve never went for a diagnosis or actually spoken to a doctor other than asking if Modafinil was right for me and trying that out for a bit with little success.   For roughly six years I have been working in a career that has been hit hard from my issues. There are minor issues on the job that result from inability to focus on tasks or stay in one particular spot. I struggle with the more complex tasks involved in my job while I thrive in the faster paced, physical tasks. Unfortunately latter is generally the menial tasks. However the biggest problem is my inability to advance my career. I’ve tried countless times to hit the books and study for the many exams I face when trying to move up the ladder. I’ve taken countless courses which have all seems like failures. I’ve had such little success that it’s taken a psychological toll on me. Failing at advancing myself while seeing all my colleagues around me moving up and passing me by. It’s something that has bothered me for years, everyday. It eats at me. It’s led to a lot of questions and confusion in my life. “Should I even bother anymore? Should I just cut my loses now even though I’ve spent six years working at it? Is this why my life is so miserable?” I don’t know what to do. I get by but throughout my life things have always been tough because of this.   I want to talk to a doctor but I’m currently staying in a different city where a family doctor or walk in clinic probably wouldn’t help me much nor do I have the time at the moment. Has anyone seemed help from other professional sources? Would counselling be beneficial?  Thanks a lot,  Have a good day.

Basically I just moved across the country and I no longer have my awesome GP that I grew up with in my home town. I am M/25 and I just started on Vyvanse at my GP's recommendation 1 year ago. Many changes have happened in my life since then but overall vyvanse has been great to me, I went through a roulette about a month ago where I tried different types of meds from my GP because Vyvanse seemed to be giving me massive "frustration" in the evenings. Alas, all the other meds I tried were much much worse on side effects those would be adderall and concerta. I couldn't handle adderall for more than 3 days before bringing it back and reverting to vyvaanse, but I digress my concern is that I have never been formally "diagnosed" with ADHD.   Some background:   My older brother (28) has been formally diagnosed since he was a teenager and has been on all kinds of different meds his whole life. He was originally brought to a psych for depression / behavioral problems in his teens and is doing much better now. Anyway, I never really thought I had much of a problem in life (I just kind of coasted by as a C student through highschool and college) until I finally graduated and tried to become an "adult" in the real world. I quickly realized that my massive procrastination tendencies were not a school thing, it was a school, work, home anytime thing. I have had 4 GF's through college / HS and my current GF finally said something to me: "You just don't seem interested in me sometimes". I was like, what... of course I am... wait... ALL of my previous GF's have said that wtf... Then I suddenly realized that I've never really been interested in anything.. at least not for a long period of time. I have a horrible memory with names, faces, birthdays.. my GF picks on me all the time about how I don't know my own Mom/Brother's birthday. I login to pay my student loan and I can't remember my mom's maiden name. I didn't pay my student loan for 3 months in a row after graduating for NO REASON, I had the money and I just didn't do it. This is a consistent trend and the one that bothers me the most. I have done this with lots of different bills, why the hell would I not pay my own bills when I have the money?? I then pay it immediately when I realize it and make a note to not do that again (It inevitably happens again but I will usually remember successfully for a few months). I look back and realize that I survived high school and college with notes, lists, lots of sticky notes and my favorite reminder item my white board in my room.  So anyway, GF finally tells me maybe I should go see a Doc because that doesn't seem normal. I finally went and was VERY embarrassed when talking to my GP about "mental" problems. I've never ever talked to a doctor about mental problems before and basically just told him the story above. I took a small yes/no test afterward and he looked up my family history and then just suggested I try Vyvanse. I said sure why not i'm young and might as well see if medicine is something that could help. Well turns out Vyvanse is very helpful and reduces my attention and memory problems a lot, however since I have moved he can only perscribe me for 1 more month out of state.  Should I try to get a more formal diagnosis or just go to another GP and transfer my medical docs over? I know Vyvanse works for me and i'm not trying to spend the next 6 months with shrinks if possible.

(grad school/writing/frustrated neurotypical loved ones);;;Today is day three of three days in a row I had set aside to work on my dissertation. The first day went great - I was writing a new section and working with new material and my brain was very happy. Yesterday, however, was worthless. Here's my analysis of the problem: early in the dissertation research and writing process, I was constantly working with new material and learning new things, and my reward center stayed active and happy. Now that I'm down to the drudgery of details and filling in gaps and going back over old sections, my brain often shuts down. Many times, if I've taken my Adderall, it picks something else to hyperfocus on, and I can stare at the pages of my dissertation or whatever I'm trying to read in service of it all day long, but my brain is doing a cha-cha chorus line to some other subject the whole time and I can't process anything on the page. I was trying to explain this to my boyfriend and that I'm trying to figure out how to work around it and he got that "tone." You know the one. The one neurotypicals always get when we talk about our problems. He said, "That may be true, but it doesn't get your dissertation written." To which I had one of my typical ADHD explosive outbursts. It's so frustrating. Does anyone know how to harness hyperfocus for the power of good? How can I get it to focus on what I need it to focus on?
efdb5c0ff20ee0721dc0ea59bd3a68d95d2995e821d8934c7d7120ac2d70d434;;;Just looking for some empathy, maybe a little motivation (this is... really long);;;I'm so sorry in advance if this is going to come across as self-loathing and very "oh, pity me," I swear I don't mean it that way. I just had a revelation, and it hit me like a ton of bricks, and I'm an emotional wreck today. So I am going to rant, and rant until I feel a little better. If you don't want to read that, I understand haha.  I'm a 24F who has finally come to terms with the fact that I'm probably working with mental illness. I'm un-diagnosed, but I'm also pretty sure I'm the poster child for ADHD. It hurts and feels good to acknowledge that there's likely something going on that's beyond my immediate control.  Growing up, I've sort of always been teased about my attention span. When my mom would give me chores to do as a kid, she'd say, "Repeat after me, put away clothes, put away toys, make bed? OK? Repeat it all the way to your room."  And merrily away I'd march, with all the determination in the world, chanting "Put away clothes, put away toys, make bed. Put away clothes, put away toys, make bed. Put away clothes... put away toys.... put away clothes and toys.... clothes, toys..."  Can't tell you how many lunch boxes and sweaters were left at school, and it would just drive my mom nuts. But she also thought it was a cute little story to tell people, how byebylittlesebastian would just "lose her head if it weren't on her shoulders!" Yeah. I probably freaking would. I need help, woman.  Now, my mom, is sharp as a tack, quick as a whip. She couldn't *ever* sympathize with my memory, my attention span. She still doesn't to this day. Which, I guess, is why I've made it to 24 without having ever said I have ADHD, or trying to go to the doctor for it at all. I sort of grew up with this idea, like, hey it's YOUR brain, YOU take the reigns and YOU take care of your business. It *still,* honestly, seems like it should be that simple. It still frustrates me to no end that my willpower is not enough. How badly I want my willpower to be enough....  I'm *forever* misplacing my wallet, keys, debit card, I.D (because they often don't stay in the wallet), make up items, entire school textbooks, clothes. You name it, I'll lose it.   In fact, I'll tell myself "OK. I'm going to put these keys in this drawer. That way, in the morning, I'll know *right* where they'll be."  Then, in the morning... I'll remember that I put the key somewhere safe. But I just can't remember for the life of me where I decided that safe place would be. It's like I'll remember *everything* I was doing up until the moment I actually put the keys somewhere. Then when I finally find them, "oohhhh, yeah ok, now I remember."   I can't remember what I've told people, and what I haven't, so I start off almost everything I say with, "and if I've already told you this, please stop me."   I've stopped carrying purses because I set them down and then *completely forget about them.* I can't tell you how many purses I've left places. It's ridiculous. (Backpacks, for whatever reason, I don't seem to leave behind, so I bring a backpack with me everywhere, including bars, and people think I'm weird.) However, there *have* been times, when I get home from my 30 min commute to work, and realize my backpack is still over there. So, I turn around and drive back. What else can I do, yknow? I try to not get super pissed every time it happens, because, well, I'd be ragingly pissed all the time.   At 24, my mom still tries to give me this elementary level advice. "When you leave places, ask yourself 'OK, do i have my keys? Check. Phone? Check. Wallet? Check. Did I bring anything else I need?" and my response is always, "IF I THOUGHT TO DO THAT, THEN I WOULDN'T HAVE THIS ISSUE."   My memory is *scarily* horrible. I mean I actually worry about if I am going to have any memory at all come 50 years old. I can be in the middle of a sentence and forget what I'm talking about. Typically, I can't recall what I did just two days ago (that's not entirely accurate... I can recall what I did, I just don't know which day it was, if that makes sense. Chronologically, my memory fails every time.)  Also, though, I'll remember "oh! I have homework due at midnight, I need to turn that in as soon as I get home." But when I get home, I forget. And then I don't even remember until two days later, when it randomly pops up in my mind, "oh yeah, that homework was due two days ago." (Which, yes, I have a planner. But I've been too depressed lately to even let myself look at it, so that I don't have to realize fully all of the shit I'm putting off.. which bring me to my next point.. )  ALAS, The *WORST* part of it all, still, seems to be my *intense* procrastination, and then my semi-successful denial. I procrastinate, and procrastinate, and procrastinate, and when something is stressing me out? I change the station in my mind. I just don't allow my thoughts to go there. It's come to the point where *so many things* (bills, school, work) are stressing me out, I'm putting them *all* on the back burner, and I'm watching my life crash and burn in front of my eyes, but I'm actively numbing myself to it. I sit in front of my computer, instead, and read article after article, reddit post after reddit post. And somehow it doesn't feel terrible. In the moment.  But recently, I think I've been getting depressed. This past Saturday I slept *18 hours*. I'm not joking. I was awake for only 6 hours of the day. And I could have slept through those, too, probably. I've been feeling an extra bit of hatred for myself. My inability to get my shit together. My laziness makes me hate myself.   What's so peculiar is I seem to be very well liked. At work and at school. I make friends very easily. People always act shocked when I express any emotion other than "bubbly, happy" type of emotions. When I'm at work or school I'm almost in this high. Where I gogogogogo as much as I possibly can, and then as soon as I'm not around people anymore, I shut down. And stop all productivity (even though sometimes my gogogogoing is pseudo-productivity, and not productivity at all.) I think I spend so much effort convincing people that I'm a happy person, that by the time I get home, I've got no energy to be that happy person. It feels very manic/depressive but cycling only through 24 hours.   I literally missed my 10 AM class today because I was laying in bed. Couldn't get myself up. Lazy as heck. Which made me cry, and write this rant. Which has, admittedly, made me feel *much* better, and I'm going to get up now, and go to my next class.   If you read this, thanks. If you have some advice, or words of encouragement. I'll take them.    **waaaaaaaaay TL;DR** 24F ranting about my brain and looking for empathy, and maybe a wake up call. TBH, if I were decent at summarizing, I would have just done that. Lol.

I believe that's going to be my difficulty in getting a diagnosis. Everyone put down my inability to follow instructions, work productively, understand concepts, avoid distractions to being a stoner. I was deemed a useless employee because of the weed and treated awfully which was enough to put me off work for two years.

I've always been a bit spacey and  a daydreamer, I forget what people have said in the middle of instructions or conversations. I'll be reading books and find I'm almost finished with a page but I haven't actually taken a word in.  Through primary and early secondary school I did well academically but then as soon as the work got to the point where I didn't just 'know it', I started struggling. I can't study to save my life, it's just like staring at the page but nothing actually enters my head.  I dropped out of sixth form because I was struggling and failing nearly all of my classes, I enjoyed them and knew the materials but I could never organise myself enough to do any decent coursework and I just fell apart in all my exams.  It didn't get any better when I started working either, even though they'd teach me things several times I could never get it to stick in my mind so I'd constantly be making mistakes or losing track of what I needed to do and when, so far I've been fired from two jobs for being unable to complete my work adequately.  Which brings us up to now, a friend who has ADHD mentioned that I seemed to fit a lot of symptoms, I dismissed them at first as, like many, I've always assumed ADHD meant little kids running around everywhere and getting into trouble and that wasn't me. I've also been diagnosed with anxiety and depression, the depression fairly well managed but the anxiety less so.  So now I'm thinking it's possible that I could have inattentive ADHD but I'm so scared to go to my doctor and ask for a referral in case they say that I'm actually fine and I'm just lazy. Has this happened to anyone before and if so what did you do? Any tips for working myself up to this?   It just feels like there might finally be an explanation for why I don't seem to be able to do anything with my life but the thought of it just being me being just plain sucky scares me so much.  TLDR: Think I could have ADHD but worried it's just laziness. Please help.

3a93872ce17d4ba09fce2ae325ade27ed4f1a77b22b0fddff62cb25c40611520;;;Update to: I think starting grad school was a mistake. It's not getting better...;;;Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/5dz3ic/i_think_starting_grad_school_was_a_mistake/).  The good news: I spoke with several members of the faculty and administration, and we agreed to transfer me to the regular track. It's actually easier for my employer to accommodate me with the regular track schedule, and I have more options in what classes and how many to take. I also registered with my university's ODS. I'm requesting 15 minute breaks every hour during an exam.  The bad news: Going into my exam on Friday, I was riding a C+ in Biostatistics. I flunked the exam. Even after the curve, I got a 63. I wasn't able to get to many of the questions because of time. Apparently, the STATA output worksheet we were given had data on it for different questions than what I thought the professor had said right before the exam, so I spent a lot of time writing out calculations I didn't need to do. This meant that I missed a lot of details in other questions and made lots of stupid, careless mistakes. I studied a ton for this quiz, and made a cheat sheet that I thought was awesome. Unfortunately, it can only help so much if you *don't actually read the question*.  The ugly: I'm taking two classes. Right now, I have a C in Biostatistics and a C in Intro to Epi (why a C? I had a panic attack during the midterm and failed). I need a 3.0 GPA, or my employer will no longer pay for my classes, which means I'll drop out. The only way I can get a C+ in Epi is by getting a perfect score on the last homework and final. I can't get a B in Biostats *even if* I get a perfect score on the final. It's not looking good for me.  Silver linings: I don't need this degree. I already have a master's degree. I pursued this one because it teaches skills I'm very interested in and could make me very competitive. I didn't pay tuition. The money I've spent towards this program went into GRE tutoring, GRE testing, application fees, and tuition fees. I'm guessing around $2,000 total? Could be worse. Finally, I've been thinking about moving for a while, but the thing that has largely anchored me to my city is this program. If I'm not in it anymore, I'll be able to move sooner than I originally planned.  It just sucks when you work hard for something and fail. I need a hug.

I took Ritalin and that worked like a charm, sorta. I was quiet and got all my work done, but I never felt like myself and lost my appetite. I stopped taking them when I was in the 7th grade.   I feel like I've always been slow at everything. I can't process anything as fast as other people can. I'm lazy and made procrastination a habit. Doing so builds a lot of stress and puts a lot weight on my shoulders. I can't help it. Why am I so lazy or is this just the way I am?   People say I'm bright and see me having a good future, but I'm not sure if they are saying that to boost my self esteem or if they're right. There are times I feel like I can accomplish what I put my mind to and that's the best feeling in the world. But most of the time I think I'm a failure.   So not too long ago I started taking medication again. I started with Ritalin. I didn't think it was working, so I went to Adderall IR. I felt like the the IR didn't last long enough for me so went to XR. I did that for about a month until I moved on to Vyvanse. Vyvanse worked incredibly well until I noticed something wrong. None of the medication worked as they were supposed to. It gave me a great high sensation like I can accomplish anything I wanted to do. But I never accomplished anything I needed to do, only what I wanted.  I feel like the medication made me ADD worst. I would lose focus faster than I normally would. I then realized I was addicted to the medication. I took it for a little over a year. When I knew I was getting bad, (everyone was telling me how skinny I got. I'm 5'5" and weighed at my lowest 113 pounds. Yikes right? I'm 138 pounds now.) I quit the medication cold turkey. I know that's bad, but I did it and it worked. I've been off the medication for almost a year now.   I started taking the medication when I started college. It sort of helping in the beginning but it stopped working. Like I said before the medication made me do what I wanted to to do not needed, so I stared skipping classes and what not. When I was in class I wouldn't pay attention and just browse the web on my laptop doing what ever I wanted. I then just completely dropped out of school. I've been calling it a "break" but it's almost been 2 semesters.  I need to go back to school, but I don't know if I can with the way that I am. I feel helpless because I don't think medication can help me and I don't think I can change myself.   Has anyone had this problem with Adderall? I've never taken Concerta before, but I'm thinking about it. I don't think it'll work for me though. Does anyone have experience with this?   I just feel like my mind is too slow, I break everything I touch, and I'm too lazy to get anything done. I just need help and guidance to get me back on my feet. I just hope I can do that.  Thank you so much to anyone that read all of that. It's been hard for me to share this with anyone.

I never considered that I may actually have it after a lifetime of people telling me everyone gets distracted and the fact that academically I have always done well "proves" there's nothing wrong with me.  I am based in the UK and have read so much about how it is basically impossible to be tested and diagnosed on the NHS within a reasonable time frame so I am looking into private options. I have only received one quote so far from a private psychiatrist for £595 which is quite a bit out of my price range at the moment. Has anyone in the UK had any success with having an ADD assessment closer to the price range of around £300? That's not my upper limit but I'm not sure I'd be able to afford too much more as I'm a student.   My university has offered to cover most of the costs for me to be assessed by an educational psychologist and although they think it is very likely I have ADD, they are unable to offer me anything other than study skills training and extra time in exams if diagnosed.  Since this is an issue that has been ongoing for so long I don't feel I'll benefit all that much from the study skills training, especially after adopting techniques I have found on this sub.  Would it be possible to take the report they give me (if they do settle on a diagnosis of ADD) to my GP for a prescription for medication? Has this worked for anyone as an alternative to seeing a psychiatrist? I tried calling my GP practice earlier however they told me I need an appointment with my GP to even discuss this.  Has anyone else gone through this process with a private psychiatrist or educational psychologist in the UK and would you be willing to share your experiences and offer me any advice? Any recommendations for psychiatrists would be much appreciated, I am based in the North East and would be willing to travel.  I am especially interested in how much your assessment cost and what the outcomes were.  Thanks for reading and apologies if I have left any details out. Feel free to comment/PM for more information.

I've been reading posts here for awhile and am hoping there may be other people here in my situation. Some background - I've always been introspective and inattentive, the "lost in my own thoughts" type, but wasn't diagnosed until after college due to assuming (and being told by others) that I was just lazy. (I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety in my early teens, and throughout high school and college I blamed most of my ADD symptoms on my other mental health issues.) I've always been talented in writing and English classes, and a voracious reader, so my family, teachers and I always assumed that smart and ADHD were mutually exclusive. I know now this is so untrue, and now that I am an adult in the working world I see how my ADHD seriously hinders and otherwise successful and fulfilling career.   About three months ago, I moved from a large city where I was working as an editor for a magazine to a very small town outside a very small city, but I kept my job and am working remotely now. I moved to be with my boyfriend of seven years, six of which we were together long distance. I was resisting moving to be with him out of fear that I would be damning my career and thus giving up my independence, so I am so thankful that I was allowed to keep my job AND be with the man that I love.   While my relationship has never been better, the move has totally taken a toll on my work, which in turn leaves me in a constant state of anxiety. I never realized how much the enforced schedule of going to an office every day and being around people helped me structure my work flow. Now, I have trouble even getting up on time to work in my home office (a completely separate room which I've set up to be like productivity HQ, so no excuses there), staying accountable and communicating with my coworkers and working on assignments in increments. Basically I feel like I'm back in college pulling all-nighters to complete work that was assigned weeks ago. I know many of you are familiar with the panic-induced productivity that springs up the hours before a deadline, and this is mostly how I've been able to file stories on deadline.  Since my work is deadline-based, I've found myself back in this habit of pulling together work at the last minute fueled by anxiety. This is obviously not healthy, most importantly, but I know that my supervisors have started to notice. While they've been very accommodating so far, I fear that their patience with me is running thin. I really am fortunate to work in a field that I am interested in and make a good amount of money while living with my SO, but I'm terrified that my ADHD will result in me getting fired. Where I live now is a very economically depressed small city, and there are few (if any at all) job opportunities in my field. I did look around for a new job before moving, but found none that would offer the same opportunities that I have in my current job working for a national publication.   Do any of you work remotely or freelance? How do you structure your time and work towards deadlines without the inherent organization of being in an office setting? How do you avoid spending all day fucking around on the internet?? Any tips would be greatly appreciated, thank you!  tl;dr: Moved from a big city to be with SO, kept my job and am now working remotely. ADHD rears its ugly head and I have trouble organizing my work and structuring my day, and now supervisors are starting to notice and get frustrated. How do I turn this around, keep my job and prove to my boss that I'm a worthwhile member of the team?

I was taking 20mg citalopram (Celexa) for about a month and a half before I followed up with my GP. After telling him my forgetfulness, inattention and boredom/hyperactivity have elevated on the citalopram, he put me on 50mg generic Zoloft. It's been like 2-3 days and my impulsiveness and lethargy are way up. I can't seem to stop eating either, and I've been craving caffeine more than usual.   My GP recommended me a psych out of my insurance group, and most of the psychs within my group don't look too great. My mom wants me to go see a behavioral counselor or something for a diagnosis within our insurance. Obviously that'd be a place to start but I wouldn't be receiving the treatment I'm looking for (medication.) I'd really like to try adderall or vyvanse but I don't know how to suggest that without seeming like I'm a drug seeker. I have a big self medication thing with cannabis that I haven't discussed with my GP either, something I'd be more comfortable discussing with a psych.   I'd like to hear your experience with SSRIs before your diagnosis/treatment with stimulants, and if you think it'd be worth it to go to a better psychiatrist that isn't covered by insurance. Thanks.

Please provide your thoughts and experiences, as well as what types of therapy (DBT, CBT, etc.) you've done and how they've worked for you. Thanks =3  ---  Hey, I was just looking to get people's opinions and experiences with clinical psychologists vs. Licensed Mental Health Counselors. I currently see a psychiatrist who I've been seeing for 3+ years who has diagnosed me with ADHD but feel like he's never been really that helpful beyond giving me access to medication. I definitely have wanted to address issues regarding my impulsive decision making, failure to learn from experience, and sensation seeking behaviors and so I decided to seek out someone who does psychotherapy, specifically someone trained in DBT (which focuses on emotional regulation skills and mindfulness) because I did some of it through a friends and family group I participated in while dating a girl (now ex) with BPD. I found it really useful and want to continue it, along with pursuing other things that would help me better cope with my ADHD, such as getting help developing my habits around school and homework and figuring out how I best learn. Anyways, would love to hear people's thoughts on what type of therapist they recommend or what types of therapies have worked for them. Feel free to ask me any questions.

afd50191208393224e8e03515f4192ddc18a3b28b16abf628abd9014788c4a56;;;Feeling extremely discouraged. My psychiatrist doesn't even know what to do anymore.;;;I'll try to make it short. I've been seeking treatment for ADHD-PI since I was diagnosed 4 years ago. In that time I've taken Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse, and Strattera, among about a dozen other medications for anxiety, depression, and bipolar 2. At my worst I took 100mg of Adderall IR and noticed literally no effect.  Today I talked to my psychiatrist and asked about treating my ADHD symptoms again. She said she literally did not know what to do. She prescribed me Daytrana but no pharmacy within 50 miles of me has it or is able to get it.  Anyways. I've only ever been able to find scattered posts about people saying "same" with no real substantial suggestions. I don't really know what to do at this point. My ADHD has basically taken everything from me.

I was recently denied government aid through healthcare.gov and would have to pay $200 a month for health care when I can barely afford the food to feed myself.   Last year I started to think that maybe my academic failure wasn't because I was simply stupid or lazy but because something was interfering. No matter how hard I tried, no matter how smart every one of my peers, teachers, and superiors thought I was, I always did mediocrely. This continues to today. I won't list my symptoms here because I believe they all fit the bill. I can't meditate, and I can't create proper habits in my life. No matter how hard I try because life is so stressful and jam-packed I end up reverting back to my old habits of losing my car keys, fidgeting, procrastinating, cutting people off mid-sentence. etc etc. When I take quizzes online (I know, they aren't a diagnosis.) I have gotten positive results on 100% of the 10+ quizzes I have taken.  My question is what can I do that is affordable, and what can I do to get help and a diagnosis in central Texas at the age of 22 as a university student to hopefully correct myself so I may get my school and life back on track?
475e4861dd21797c54820b572dff094fa173eee37b415bd8ecb4fdd8906c4a09;;;Workplace rights - battle between day shift and night shift.;;;As the title states, my work has two shifts. I work the night shift at a lab. My shift does 90% of the work; my department processes at least 900 samples a night, whereas day shift does maybe 300.   I have searched on several ADHD websites and an hr website and I'm still not sure if or how I'm protected in a matter that's coming up on Thursday when both shifts from my department are meeting to clarify some differences in procedure between shifts.  We have had a splitter tube system for sending samples for testing at our core lab; this involves pouring off a bit of sample from the main tube into a splitter tube. This means if a client calls for additional testing, we still have some sample at the lab to do the testing.  Day shift completely stopped using splitter tubes and this makes client add ons incredibly difficult because we no longer have the sample and have to call the core lab to tell them to do it.  Getting the samples together at the end of the night to send off to the core lab (we have a cut off time in which to get all of our send out stuff ready and into the flight box for the courier to pick up) can be hectic, and having the splitter tubes helped immensely.  My shift does things the way they have always been done, and on Saturdays when both shifts work the night shift, the day shift people have started complaining that the splitter tubes confuse them.  So we're having a meeting Thursday evening, and I would like to be prepared. My boss and manager (and most of my co-workers) know that I have ADHD, but I don't think they really understand. I would like to be able to tell them the reasons why we need to keep doing the split offs the old way, not only for customer satisfaction but for efficiency and less stress on my part.   Can I print out some ADA information and basically say, "I have a disability and you need to make allowances when it comes to me being able to do my job properly."  Any advice? For years the atmosphere of the lab has basically been that day shift (who work with our manager) complain and the manager gives them what they want, without consulting us, just to shut them up. So I'm betting on this meeting being pointless. I would like to be able to go in there and be confident in my proposals.  Apologies if I rambled. I'm leaving for work soon and my meds haven't kicked in yet.  Thanks.

For example today, i woke up at 3am, since i went to bed in 9pm last night. I tried to get back to sleep but couldnt fall asleep. So i took concerta, waited one hour and fell asleep almost instantly and slept another three hours.  And after i started concerta i have been able to take naps during the day. (never done this before because i couldnt fall asleep during days)
955a10d976d4bab8ac6d0ce69c3de08950d89d9501f2e9941bcecf541128a4b9;;;My goal/dream possibly isn't attainable due to adhd?;;;I'm losing my shit right now and I feel lost. I'm convinced I have ADHD and I've been looking at psychs actively to go speak with someone and get properly medicated. I've been hammering this lately to figure it out, and obviously I'm not a medical professional but I've put enough together to diagnose myself. But I've been actively trying to put a solution to this so I could start flight training, because I want to be a pilot. But after looking into it, I won't get medical approval while on ADHD medication or if I have an ADHD diagnosis on my record.  The whole point of me hammering out this ADHD diagnosis and shit, is for me to stay focused on flying and pursue my dream career as a commercial pilot. Because in the past, I've had this same spark for say becoming a doctor and majoring in biology in college as I do for becoming a pilot, but I regressed to my average state of being and got lazy and shit and dropped out of college.   It's almost like I lie to myself every so often and say "alright we're gonna buckle down, take everything seriously, not more bullshit" and within a matter of weeks, I regress to my default.  And that's exactly why I haven't started flying yet, because it's expensive as fuck and I can't afford to throw away thousands of dollars just to end up becoming distasteful of it.  I feel so lost right now, and I have no one to talk to because it's the middle of the night. I was so excited to finally get a diagnosis and treatment and now I have to either risk all this money (this is how it feels right now) or find a new passion, which is fucking impossible.
ec5056f674a2c17e020bfb85ceed31d1c61b016ddc2cb6f8d734a26b501b1c1b;;;Just want some quick advice - seriously, this will be short...for once :D;;;SO. Been working on getting diagnosed for a while, got the run around, etc. Currently waiting to hear back from just my regular dr about setting up a 'telehealth' video call with a psych, because i live in the middle of nowhere. I just found online that there is a psych about 45 mins away from me, and I've been waiting for over a week to hear back from my regular doc...should I call the other office? It specifically says on their site they do Adult ADHD testing, sooooo I think that may be best?  TL;DR - Continue waiting (1 week+ already) for regular doctor to set up video conference psych, or just go to one 45 minutes away that I know does the testing?
e3beebf9c43b17ee6f330d731cf9b8fe1458a87fc684f511622dd5b5fcb59bbc;;;I'm not quite sure where to start, but I feel like I'm going nowhere in life and that I won't ever be able to get anywhere in life.;;;I have not been diagnosed with ADHD, however as a child I was diagnosed with Aspergers and strongly suspect that I do have ADHD and it affects my life greatly and I feel like I can't do anything about it. I almost feel like my brain is broken and lately it has really been getting to me. Like no matter what I do, how hard I try, how much willpower I throw into my existence, that it will just never be good enough. I've researched a lot about ADHD and I have almost all of the symptoms. I've also spent a while lurking around here just reading things about all you other people and the ways you are affected by your ADHD. When reading the little anecdotes I often feel like they describe me. Those are things that *I* have happen to me.   I hate how scattered my mind is. I'm living in almost constant confusion from things like losing things and later finding them in really strange places. This morning I was looking for something, I forgot what it is but while I was searching for it at random around my bedroom I ended up finding a watch I lost 5 years ago. My mother was very angry about me losing it but no matter how hard I looked I could never find it until now when I was looking for something completely different. The amount of times I lose things is absolutely ridiculous. If I'm not thinking about something *right now* then I will most likely forget about it unless I write it down somewhere and then I sometimes forget where I wrote it down or that I even wrote it down. My short term memory is really really terrible. I often get yelled at for leaving lights on because I get distracted by something else I start doing and leave the room with the lights on and don't realise until I get yelled at over it.   Recently I was doing a course which required class and assignments and that was extremely difficult. However, I'm quite proud of myself because I actually managed to complete it. I hardly ever am able to properly complete things like that because assignments and paying attention in class is almost difficult for me and doing assignments takes me a lot longer and requires a lot more effort than it seems to for other people. The worst parts about trying to study or do an assignment are when my cat winks at me or something then I have to google why cats sometimes do that and then half an hour later I'm reading about spoons. I think the only reason I was even able to complete the course was my near abuse of caffeine. I didn't really like having to use it. But, I decided to choose my mind and the success of the course over my body. It didn't affect me the way that caffeine affects most other people. Instead of it waking me up it did the opposite. It made me calm and almost drowsy. It made my mind go from being a radio that receives every frequency at once to being able to just tune into a few frequencies. My mind was almost quiet. I was able to not get so distracted from things and could concentrate on one thing at a time for longer. It wasn't perfect but it was better than without caffeine. I barely have caffeine now that I finished the course and I have noticed a big difference. I'm a lot more scattered since stopping caffeine but I'm willing to put up being yelled at for now because my body needs a break from the caffeine.   My mother refuses to even entertain the thought that I could have ADHD and won't even let me tell her about the symptoms because when I was a kid and was getting diagnosed with aspergers she already googled a bit about ADHD 10 years ago and knows everything and that I don't have ADHD because when I was diagnosed with aspergers as a kid the doctors would have noticed it. According to my mother I'm just lazy, I need to just try harder at things, that I can just train my brain and that to get better memory I just need to try harder to remember. This is from the woman whose best advice for difficulty sleeping is to just close your eyes and roll over and go to sleep. Sometimes I wonder if I am just lazy but I feel like I'm trying as hard as I possibly can. Like I'm watching everyone else stand on an escalator and smoothly going up to the next level of the building of life while I have to sprint up the down escalator to slowly inch my way up to that next level. I wish I could get tested for ADHD but I don't really know how to. My mother won't help me, My psychologist just seems to focus on anxiety which seems to be her area of expertise. I already know how to decently manage my anxiety. I've had to learn how to cope with anxiety on my own. I feel like I'm living with the limitations of a disability while other people expect me to live to the same standard as a person without any disabilities. I feel trapped and unable to get out of this struggle. I did want to see a psychiatrist but my mother said I don't need any medication for anything so I had to just see a psychologist. I also worry that if I pursue an ADHD diagnosis I may be seen as a drug seeker because I'm a young adult.   I apologise that this got a bit long and I'm just going to post it before I make it even longer. I just don't know how to progress in life while having so much difficulty just trying and failing to keep up with it. I don't know what to do.
367016d1a6d8f476e47aeeaf8c1bd38f6bd849822e58291c1f12b14b23e176d1;;;I'm not going to slip through the cracks this time.;;;Last year high school student taking college classes. I've consistently failed English classes, my pattern being turn in the first essay super early, and then flat out get overwhelmed and don't turn in any of the others.   I've only gotten this far because of a combination of professor error, pity, and my "apparent intelligence." Still have an F and a WF, along with a few poor grades in other classes. My grades have read like an alphabet for the past few semesters. A, B, C, D (or F.)    This summer, got diagnosed. ADHD-PI. It was so validating but my mind is wrapped up in so many irrationalities already. Low self esteem, low self trust. But I'm clever. Got an 33 on the SAT. (Or ACT, whichever one is out of 36. Dunno.)  I think I'm so far behind. I get stuck on that so many times. I don't think more than a month ahead because I'm scared to have aspirations.      But brief aside over. This semester, hardest I've ever hard, because I have 4 information classes that I need to memorize so much for.  My previous semesters have had 2 or so really easy A classes I could bullshit. These are all hard, effort classes. Other problems too. Medication needed adjustment 3 times (Adderall ♡), think I still need another after this semester.  Learning how to manage having a job. The big old 1-8 birthday. Figuring out how to organize (post its, index cards, clipboards and graph paper are the way to go). Still got myself stuck in a hole with schoolwork.    My grades are A, A, B, F. Two of those grades are threatened by big assignments I haven't turned in, and I have to make up the F. They're papers, again.  Along with those other small tasks that I failed to do every week.    But I did something different this semester. I got stuck in a hole midway through. It was a paper. I GOT MYSELF OUT. That never happened before. Before I just lapsed into a depressive slump and failed everything. I got overwhelmed. I gave up.   But now I want it. Now I can do it. Now I can fix it. I have a note card  on my desk.  Well two actually. One says "FOCUS" in big marker letters. The other says "ARPET FIXES EVERYTHING". Because I can fix this. And next time I won't have to fix it because I'll just do it.  I'll have my meds figured out, I'll stop having so many 0% days. And I love this feeling.     My problem before was that everything overwhelmed me. The future was a big ball of I don't know and I couldn't pull out a thread to start untangling.  So I just stopped trying.    But this is different.  I want it this time. No more apathy, no more resignedness.  I am not going to slip through the cracks this time.  I will catch up, I will prevail, and I can finally stop being so unreliable.   That's what I want. I want to be reliable. I want to be trustworthy. I want to trust myself. And I can. And I will. And I'll change. And I'll be.

I've been recently diagnosed and was given 40mg Strattera to start my treatment. Today is my very first day on the med.   The doctors basically told me that a small dose like what I'm taking should have basically no positive effects at all, and the first real differences will come in a month time after we double the dose.  Today I managed to do everything I like to do in the morning (meditate, eat breakfast, prepare lunch, brush theet) without forgetting anything, and came to work early.   This NEVER happens. Is it just placebo effect or is the med already kicking in? Either way, this is a very good morning :)

Eric Tivers unfortunately doesn't work for me;;;I've heard such amazing things, but the intros are too long for me. I don't want to take a seminar, I don't want to listen to people who have.   I finally figured out how much space to skip to start the podcast, bu by then, with the waiting for it to load, making sure I skipped enough but not too much.... i get too excited about the topic and it takes too long to get into it so i go on to the next video to see if it's quicker... then on to the next... the next... the next. Before I knew it I had clicked on what seemed like 50 episodes.  So then I googled adhd in the search and found tonnns of podcasts, most weren't my thing, the person talking has to have adhd, i can't take advice from people who don't. Is that weird? Anyway, i found one, she was great, but i lost it when I parked to get gas. Never found it again :-(   I typically love podcasts, but they have to grab my attention right away or I'm over it. And none of that teasing thing then onto sponsors webinars, etc etc etc.   His topics sound awesome though, he should have a tldr version for every podcast. Anyone know something similar? Oh, also need a soothing voice, loud noises freak me out lol :-/
d6e7204e557db528b5b1e4cd907922a7a6b581447cda6909423dc25586cdd67e;;;Followup: Doctor is apparently treating wrong disorders;;;So as a followup to my older post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/5glzw5/doctor_refusing_to_diagnose_adult_adhd_based_on/), I got a second opinion while still seeing my primary doctor.  I walked out of my appointment with Doc A two weeks ago with a Zoloft script, which I've been on since then, and it's got my anxiety under control, but hasn't touched my attention.  Last night was my followup with Doc B, and it confirmed my earlier unofficial diagnosis from a therapist - ADHD-C. She was shocked that I was on Zoloft (which I stopped today, felt like a zombie on it), because I *don't have clinically significant anxiety or depression* and was misdiagnosed by Doc A, as I suspected.   And now I need to find a family doctor who is comfortable prescribing ADHD meds. Doc A said they won't treat my ADHD because their clinician didn't diagnose it - I don't meet their criteria. Which is unfortunate, but it's a specialist, so a family doctor will be cheaper in the long run.  Thanks everyone who suggested I get a second opinion. I'm glad to know I'm going to be getting the proper treatment soon.
c51fc9d9c9ba4943bad54e006e8aaaa2ede01ee79b0da8b8a5ee6ec7ca8e2fc1;;;Prescribed 10mg Ritalin. 3rd day on it and still unsure if it's working or not.;;;16/F I was diagnosed with ADD just last Monday. My psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Ritalin (Regular release) tablets. According to the description she gave me, it takes up to 1HR for it to take effect and I need to take it 3x a day.   My mom doesn't want me taking it all the time because she's afraid of the side effects so I only take it when I need it. Today is my 3rd time on it as I only take it when I feel the need to.   Here's my experience with it so far:  1st time (Tuesday):   * Waited around 30 mins after a meal before taking it.  * After what I presume to be around 40 minutes, I felt some kind of rush - I felt really happy for like 10 seconds and a bit hyper and more energized.  * Music seemed to sound much better and clearer. Like I could keep track of the song and my work at the same time. * Did so much homework in a span of 3-4 hours with no breaks in between at all. I felt like I was focused, too. In the end, I didn't have any of the side effects.    *Thought this was all placebo because it was my first time taking it and I kept expecting the results.*  2nd time (Wednesday):   * Took it 30 mins before eating a slice of pizza for lunch. After 20 mins, I just felt like doing everything but it's probably placebo effect?   * My classmate asked me if I could do her work and I immediately accepted it. Focused on it but I was working too fast and made some careless errors. She also commented that I  was working really fast.  * An hour later, I'm running all over the classroom trying to get my project done - *ended up not finishing it because I didn't know how to do a couple of things needed.*  * Again, music sounded nice. Listening to a good song I almost always listen to made me feel euphoric and happy at one point but only for a short while.  3rd time (Thursday|Today):  * Took a pill an hour after I ate a small snack for breakfast.  * after around 30 mins, I felt a head rush. Like sort of trippy or lightheaded for 10 seconds.  * Went to a meeting with a teacher for 25 minutes. Came back and started working on a letter for a friend because why not. Wrote so fast and barely stopped to think about what to say. Messy letter, though.   * Fast forward to next class: I felt energized enough to think faster and focus on my work although I had some other unrelated thoughts in my head.   * Effects seemed to start to wear off after a total of just 2.5 hours.   **No experienced side effects at all aside from decreased (not zero) appetite.**   Apologies for the long read and the numerous details. I really just want to know if what I'm feeling is placebo effect or if this is the real thing. Also, while on ritalin, I don't finish everything on my TTD list but 4/5 of them at least.   Should I bump up my dosage? I can't ask my doc because I'm in another country and will only get to see her once or twice a year.  If my dosage is the issue, can I take **2 pieces of 10mg pills (20mg) or 1 and 0.5 pieces of 10mg pills (15mg) at once** to strengthen the effects? Or would I be totally screwed up?  Thanks, reddit!  TL;DR Diagnosed with ADD and I have been prescribed 10mg of ritalin. I'm not sure what it's suppose to feel like and I'm worried it's all placebo. I get *almost* the same exact feeling - *energetic, can focus on doing something for a longer while, moving much faster* - every time I take ritalin but still doubtful because the effects seem too subtle and inconsistent or slightly different whenever I take it. Should I increase my dosage or is this all fine?  Edit: Also, is being somewhat careless but concentrated part of the whole experience?
7db3461699ac588c65f382d53db0bb4c06cdae132ea59c9a8bd8ff7f6c6d221a;;;Mt Son Will Never Play Soccer, And That's OK! Celebrating The Accomplishments of our Children With ADHD;;;I’m sitting, happily gazing at Man during a swimming lesson.  Down he goes, and then out pops his little face adorned with a satisfying grin.  I too am beaming with pride at his success—you see, until recently, his Sensory Processing Disorder made it impossible for him to fully submerge his face under water.  Watching him do this is HUGE and fills me with delight, but, I will admit, also relief.  At six, Man was the only first grader still wearing floaties at the pool, something he was acutely aware of, but unable to change.  Until now.    I glance up to notice one of his classmates sitting on a bench next to the pool.  He is quietly reading a chapter book, a large chapter book, a chapter book that clearly exceeds the literacy skills of most first graders.  He is there patiently enjoying his story while his little brother takes a swimming lesson- he has already mastered swimming himself.  A pang of jealousy and competitiveness burns inside of me.     “Do you know that I saw XX reading a chapter book!?!” I mention to a mom friend a few moments later.  She is not surprised and also casually mentions that he excels at soccer as well.  He is a classic overachiever, and is bound to succeed in life- a future filled with a fabulous career and riches galore is most definitely in the cards.  My friend marvels at this and comments on how she too would love for her son to be successful.  I respond by saying that I just want Man to grow up and be happy.  Maybe it’s because I watch him struggle at tasks that most children do seamlessly without thinking, or maybe it’s because I have already sat in four meetings with his educational team and it’s only the beginning of January, but for whatever reason, to me, success for my guy means getting off the bus with a smile on his face.  I know I am not unique in this thinking, and all parents want their kids to be happy, but each of us has a different definition of “success.”    I began to ponder, what are we really asking of our children?  It has taken many years and a boatload of acceptance for me to come to the realization that, at least for the time being, Man is not going to be the star of the class, or the captain of the soccer team, the most popular kid, or the most talented.  It’s not that he doesn’t have the potential to be many of these things, for he is smart, and kind, and funny, brilliant and talented in ways many other children are not.  But his ADHD and SPD cause him to struggle in many areas.  Watching him struggle has taught me that what is most important, what is vital to his future success, is his happiness and self esteem.  I was recently brought to tears during one of our many educational team meetings.  I tried over and over again to find something, just one single thing, which showed that Man excelled as a first grader and as a little boy.  “Maybe he calls out so much because he has a lot of ideas about the topic you are discussing!”  “What if his behavior is deteriorating because he’s bored and already understands what you are teaching?”  “Don’t you think he would benefit from some more challenging math work?”  “No”, was the repeated answer.  “No, he is not bored or in need of any more academic challenges.  He is the way he is and we are all doing the best we can for him.”  “You don’t understand, I wept, I need for him to excel at something, anything!!  Just tell me one thing he does really well!!  I watch him struggle to participate in tasks like piano and dance, things he loves and he himself chooses to do.  I need to hear that there is something, ANYTHING, that he participates in during his day that does not pose a challenge!!”  I was met with sympathetic nods, but more importantly, I was told the following, “Don’t worry, he really is doing well!  He is so happy and enthusiastic, he loves to learn and participate, he is kind and has lots of friends and he thinks very highly of himself.”    And in that moment what is most important became clear:  I no longer care that he hates soccer or that he would rather build a rocket then score a touchdown.    It doesn’t bother me anymore that he continuously calls out in class or doesn’t fit into the profile of a typical student.    I stopped defining the achievements or failures of his days by his behavior chart.  If he is still wearing floaties at the pool this summer, I would be cool with that and I would make sure he felt like a badass wearing them.  It’s not worth getting frustrated about the fact that he has been sounding out short words since he was three, but reads on grade level because he can’t focus long enough to get better at it.  The fact that he has no interest in taking tennis lessons or doing Tae Kwan Doh like his friends is of no consequence.  When he needs to leave his dance class because he is too over stimulated, so what?    That day he sat and colored for the entirety of his piano lesson because he had no more focus left in him, big deal…   I won’t tell you that I don’t worry constantly about his inability to perform the tasks of typical children his age; I worry all of the time.  But I can tell you that I am far more focused on teaching him lessons that will make these facts irrelevant in his future.  I’m trying to teach him to be himself and to be happy with whom he is.    What are the “tiger moms” of the world doing for their kids if not teaching them to define success by each external achievement?  I am teaching Man to define success by each attempt.  Failure is great; it means you had the balls to try.  If you tried, you can feel proud and accomplished.  I want him to understand that choosing happiness above all is what’s important in life.  Today it seems that we push kids to do more and be more, what happened to just being happy kids?  When did it become so important for a six-year-old to be a superstar?    Success is near impossible without happiness and good self esteem.  It is unattainable without having to learn to cope with failure, and to figure out how to pick ones self up, and try again.  Not everyone is going to win that trophy, or come in first place, and that has to be ok.  We are doing our children a disservice if we teach them that they have to be good at everything, rather then just trying their hardest. They must understand that doing their best is good enough, even when they come in last place.  Failure is part of life; it’s the grace with which you handle it and the lessons you take from it, that define you.    He might never play soccer or tennis, be a professional hip-hop dancer, or the valedictorian, but one day, things will fall into place for Man.  His future is bright and, following many failures, he will become whatever he wants to in life, I am absolutely positive about this.  But every day he is successful one, because when he lays his head on his pillow at night he does it with a smile and a sense of accomplishment.

I realized I have ADHD about two weeks ago with the help of a psychologist, but haven't got a diagnosis or have any idea when or how that will happen. I'm extremely exited to finally understand and have an explanation to my difficulties in life and hopefully get medication too, but of course without an official diagnosis I can't say for 100% certainty that that's what it is.   It's really frustrating being in this weird middle section of uncertainty, where I really feel like this explains why I am this way and gives hope to my lifelong depression, but all I can really do is wait, and it's making me even more unproductive than what I already am. It's all I can think about!  So how did you guys deal with this time? I know some people have to go through months and months of tests before getting a diagnosis. Were you able to get anything done?  TL;DR Found out I probably have ADHD and waiting for a diagnosis. Can't get anything done.

Any strategies/tips welcome;;;So I feel like this is a recurrent problem for ADHD people: we plan too much, and we never get to actually do our things.   For me, this usually involves changing my planning system. For instance: I had a perfectly good, working system set up on trello and google calendar, but last week I just decided it would be a great idea to move to pen-and-paper and started a Bullet Journal. Now I spend most of my day planning things on my BuJo and never actually do them. And I know that when the BuJo starts working, I'll probably move into other things...   Also, theres the "overplanning" aspect to it, when you just break tasks down over and over again and end up with a super detailed step-by-step to your tasks, instead of just doing them.   How do you people cope with this? What's your strategy to reduce (or completely stop) this?    EDIT: tl;dr: what do you do when you start spending most of your time planning things instead of doing them?

I also have a bit of anxiety and depression and was prescribed Sertraline in middle school. I recently realized how low my sex drive is and my doctor switched me from the Sertaline to Bupropion. He told me that it can also be useful in treating ADHD. So here's my question: has anyone else had a similar experience (taking ADHD meds and an anti-depressant, then switched to Bupropion/Wellbutrin). Did you find that you didn't really need the Concerta/Adderall, etc anymore or did you have to continue taking it to treat your ADHD?

c63f857a7c94558a1f2c0978ff4bc9aa16a5a8d3a7b2c397a8370dc34de9b023;;;Medication tachyphylaxis;;;Hi all (sorry if this is a repost but it didn't seem to appear the first time)  **Background/problem**  I'm a late-20's PhD student, diagnosed ADHD-PI last year through the full psych workup, chasing treatments for the past year. The diagnosis may have been clinically correct in that I meet the diagnostic criteria, but so far, the belief 'I have ADHD' hasn't [paid much rent](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Making_beliefs_pay_rent) [timesink warning: link directs to LessWrong].  I've tried a lot of drugs in the past year, a really absurd number of drugs, starting with the obvious ones in the stimulant class. Most of these drugs have done nothing, or made matters worse. Some work really well, but only for a short time.  **Stuff that's supposed to help but doesn't**  Low-dose Adderall produces more ADHD-like behaviors rather than less, while high-dose Adderall promotes 'scrubbing the floor with a toothbrush' activities. Ritalin at any dose exacerbates negativity -- I fixate on anything that seems like a 'problem', but in an inflexible deterministic way that precludes action rather than promoting it.  Outside the stimulant class, atomoxetine is pure nihilism in a bottle at any dose, SSRI's make me paradoxically suicidal, and even low-dose modafinil produces violent outbursts of rage.  **Stuff that helps a lot but then suddenly doesn't any more**  The only ADHD med that helped at all with the core ADHD impairments was guanfacine. Guanfacine was a home run. Despite all the side effects, I'd be glad to stay on guanfacine for the rest of my life. Unfortunately, the benefits abruptly crapped out after 4 weeks, are not recovered by any reasonable increase in dosage, and don't return even after several weeks of abstinence from the drug. Combining guanfacine with stimulants is not better than guanfacine alone, tried that a few times.  Outside the ADHD meds, I get a lot of benefits out of caffeine and nicotine. Both of these are much more effective for me than classical stimulants. However, like with the guanfacine, I experience rapid [tachyphylaxis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachyphylaxis). With all of these useful substances. the problem does not appear to be drug tolerance -- the effects don't gradually diminish over time, and discontinuation is not accompanied by a uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms or by a rebound to symptoms above baseline. All damn things just abruptly (overnight) stop working after a few days or weeks, and it takes an indefinitely long period of abstinence before they start working again.  **Baseless speculation**  Having also ventured into more obscure 'cognitive enhancement' supplements (including memantine, which did not 'reset my tolerances' as it's often purported to do) , I've had many experiences where a substance will be helpful only once, after a single administration, and trying it again after any length of time does not recover the original benefits. It's like my brain becomes 'immunized' to any particular helpful stuff.  In some ways, this issue with the medications seems reminiscent of one of the issues with the ADHD itself, in that a subject or activity that I find interesting/stimulating today is dead to me tomorrow, and it takes a long period of disengagement before a given thing can be 'fresh' and engaging once again. It's almost as though I get rapidly 'bored' with the medications the same way I get 'bored' with everything else.  **WHAT DO?**  The obvious solution would be cycling different substances. Guanfacine, nicotine, and caffeine, for instance, theoretically have quite different mechanisms of action. Frustratingly, this hasn't approach hasn't worked either -- after one effective substance craps out, all of the others seem to work poorly for a long time as well. It's sort of like there's one thing they're all hitting indirectly to produce their benefits, and that thing becomes desensitized.  At the risk of turning this into a 'DAE' post, what the hell is going on here and how does anyone else deal with this sort of thing? I venture that I'm a reasonably smart guy, and I've devoted a lot of (scarce!) attention to this, but I'm honestly at my wit's end. I'd be ready to give up on medications altogether, but the briefly-transformative power of some of these substances makes every cognitive and behavioral approach I've tried look like twiddling my damn thumbs by comparison.  **TL;DR: If you made it through all that text, maybe your meds are working better than mine.  Long struggle with ADHD medication has gone poorly, some 'atypical' drugs are spectacularly helpful, but everything that's helpful craps out rapidly. Much frustrate.**

ed98ed04c235aaa6008c7d9671cdef4fe5daf30cab045d37285f3cda7ee8eaa1;;;Something I never thought would happen to me;;;Hey guys  So after a full year of going to university and failing a majority of my courses I've reached the end of line, I'm about to be academically suspended. This is such a horrible thing that I don't even know how to react. I just got back on meds but it can't fix the damage that I've already done to myself. I have to wait until the next semester to get another opportunity to maintain the required GPA and stay in school. I'm on the verge of breaking down and I just wish I could just get a chance now to make up for it, because I'm finally becoming the student I was when I used to be on meds years ago. I'm not sure what to do, I would have to go back home and leave my girlfriend alone with no one to turn to. My parents will be so ashamed about this. I guess I'm just going to have to suck up to the consequences, this will be something I'll look back on full of regret for quite some time. To anyone that's in the same situation as me or is struggling in school, don't let it get to your head. There are plenty of options for you and university isn't always the best one for everyone. If you aren't on medication or haven't sook help for your condition, I implore you to seek help because the difference between me off and on meds is night and day. Although it's hard for us to take initiative the moment we do can make a huge difference in how we live our lives. I thank all of you for the support you guys give each other and I hope every single one of you makes it out in this tough world we all live in. As far as what I'm going to do about my situation, I'll have to figure it out once I go through all the pain that I will cause my parents and girlfriend to feel when they get the news.
b9d40134d6b14ed8cc53be022d1fb88ea7452e7c25852affd6ef1710f7709a28;;;Devastated about realizing I have ADD [Rant];;;**[TL/DR: I just realized I have ADD and feel like there are no good options and I'll never realize my potential, hopes etc.]**   This is a shameless self-pitying shitpost because I just need to get some stuff off my chest. I’m in my early 30s and was diagnosed with ADD a few years back. A psychiatrist put me on Adderall, and the effects would never last, so he eventually titrated my dose up to 120 mg/day until I was losing hair, hallucinating, never eating, having delusions, alienating everyone with my erratic behavior, lost my girlfriend and almost lost my job. He said I just needed to do deep breathing exercises and I’d feel better… I now think he believed I was trying to get a big Rx to sell or abuse and just wanted the repeat business (he told me he had a truck driver patient who he prescribed 220 mg/day, so I’m sure he was comfortable facilitating abuse or resale). Back then I was not aware that these are massive amounts of that drug, all I knew after a while was that I’m losing my mind. So I finally I just quit seeing him and tapered off the medicine on my own and flushed a shitload of it, saying “well if I do have ADD, I’ll just work extra hard. It’s probably a bullshit diagnosis to sell speed to kids and keep asshats like that shrink employed.”    And so for a few years, I bootstrapped my way through life,  but I often under-delivered and disappointed myself. I had one fantastic, prestigious opportunity to do a huge self-directed project in another country and I totally fucked it up. I don’t know where the time went, I’d spend a lot of my day pacing around my apartment in a fog. I couldn’t explain it, *I just have poor self discipline*, I said. When I got back to the structure of life in the US and regular office hours, things got better, but I never had the discipline to study for grad school or even just systematically look for opportunities to get away from the security of my mediocre job and do something better. I always felt bad about myself and drank on it a lot, while maintaining professional airs and advancing in a career I didn’t enjoy.   Finally in 2016 I quit and started working for myself as a consultant. With nowhere to be, much lower accountability, and no structure, I procrastinated a lot and floundered. I somehow made enough money last year, but there were whole months when I did almost no work. I’ve hardly worked in the last 2 months.  Again, I paced around my apartment in a fog. I was getting drunk almost every day, and I finally quit drinking so I could focus and get things done. But after half a year of sobriety, I was as foggy, lethargic, unmotivated, and distractible as ever. My girlfriend moved in, and at first I thought she was just very organized… but by late fall, I realized it wasn’t her, I’m just a mess. I started to dread waking up, thinking about how every day feels like such an uphill battle, but still thinking, I’ll figure this out.    Then three weeks ago I found out one of my adult sisters was diagnosed with ADD a few months back. I read a few articles, then a book called Fast Minds… and realized, this is very real and I *do* have this. It explains so much about me. I always thought I was smart and capable, but just needed better discipline. No dude, this is your brain and this is your life.    I had this hope that I’d mature and learn discipline, but I now realize that this is just how I am. I had such fucking hopes for myself. I have squandered and missed so many opportunities, failed in so many relationships, and I have such a long history of letting myself down that I don’t see how it will get better, given the options. I am terrified of stimulants and from what I’ve read they don’t even work after a while anyways. And I am having trouble accepting the thought  that I have to take *any* kind of psy-meds my whole life to be normal. I thought I beat that, I thought I was better than that. I was looking through directories of therapists last night just feeling despondent… half these people can’t write a complete sentence or pick a suitable picture of themselves to put on the internet, and one of *these* clowns is going to help me get my life in order? And the other half that can prescribe meds, all these people have is a hammer, all they’re going to see is a nail. Hey doc, will taking speed every day cause hypertension and cardiomyopathy when I’m in my 50’s? *Duh, I don’t know, my patients seem to respond well to it and you have to weigh the risks, blah blah...* My girlfriend (now wife) is trying to be understanding, but grew up in a country where ADD is not a diagnosis, you’re either good enough for university by 8th grade or going to work in the factories or mines. Anyways, have to pull my shit together before she comes home and pretend I am okay when I actually just want to cry and punch holes in the wall.    Well I don’t often throw pity parties but thanks for dropping by!

I'm a 27 year old woman...and I've always felt completely fucked...like 100 damaged and broken. Reading through all of the posts here has been surreal.   Like many you my life has been a series of stops and starts...6 months here 6 months there with huge fuck ups in between. Latest one was getting black out drunk which devolved into calling an ex from the bar to come get me, demanding I have a bath, and the most cringe worthy part...oh God it hurts to type this...using his roommates razor to shave because i wanted to have sex with him (ahhh gross gross gross that makes my blood run cold) Ironically im a huge germ phobe and would never do that sober. This night was followed by like 48 hours googling how I mostdefinetlyhaveaids. And feeling like a general disgusting shameful person.  I did however, ring in the new year sober and plan on staying that way. I start meds tomorrow and am looking forward to a brighter future.  What I actually came here to say...  I feel you guys so hard. It's fucking hard and I hate that i struggled for so long not knowing why the fuck I do this shit! And why I couldn't get it together.  And yes I know.  I am responsible for my decisions. But damn man you do the fucking best you can!   Anywayyy...  Be nice to yourselves. You've managed this far while facing a fucking avalanche of resistance from your own brain (you were supposed to be on my side brain!)   Forgive yourselves and stop beating yourselves up (easy to say and hard to do I know) there's only the future the past is gone. Be nice to yourselves and keep on keeping on.  If a dirty razor thief can forgive herself so can you.  Okay that was NOT short.  Sending happy vibes to everyone :)))

My son, 7 years old, was diagnosed with autism and ADHD.  They've been cycling through various medication, and we're now on 5mg of dexmethylpenidate once a day.  He took the pill fine for about a week, but now he appears to be vomiting after every other meal, and in the middle of the night.  Before we straight up blame the drug, however, I want to also point out this his siblings have also been vomiting a fair amount.  They are not on the drug.  My son has *always* had a sensitive stomach, feeding him zucchini is like giving him ipecac.  Makes him vomit once it touches his tongue.  It's pretty impressive actually, though there was some clean up involved while we tested this.  So, from community experience, has this level of vomiting been seen with dexmethylphenidate, or is it likely that the stomach bug that's going around is just being particularly mean on him?

I never knew it as ADHD, it was always, Bashfulbec is such a day dreamer, pay attention, stop fidgetting, you need to be better organised, pay better attention.   This continued into my adult life and followed me into my Bachelors where everything was left until the last minute, somehow I managed to graduate and somehow I have been in the same job for 13 years (I do enjoy it and it is pretty challenging). I'm going to be doing a Grad Dip of counselling in Feb.  I started to see a psychologist in July of last year for my OCD, he mentioned that he saw some symptoms of ADHD in me. I decided to explore and eventually I was diagnosed in December of last year. I have been on Ritalin since then and my god has it helped (not as irritable or reactive as I used to be and I seem to be able to follow through on things better now)   Before I was diagnosed, I was so excited to possibly be able to put a name to my brain. Now, after diagnosis, I feel a bit ambivalent and I find myself questioning it. is this a normal thing to go through?
80bea3290b5fb7ee25e3c73b759a76de2c32dca7f744c741e6d17f14cfa69a7d;;;Trouble reading.;;;I often find myself reading something over and over. I can read the individual words quickly but get jumbled up in the text when there are multipe words in secession (lists, sentences, etc).   I used to struggle with this problem especially when reviewing notes and studying. It would take me hours to work my way through a chapter in my textbook, and I would still struggle with the work.  I found that if I underline what I am reading as I read it, it sticks in my memory a lot better. It also helps me keep where I am on the page.    I started writing drafts and taking notes by hand which has helped improve my handwriting. I'm proud to say that my handwriting is now legable enough for most people to read it.  I'm still identifying little things about myself that need a little improvement.  Up until this point in life I didn't realize that I was missing out on so much happening right in front of me, and so much still slips through the cracks. I hope the focus I'm applying to my studies and my life doesn't subside like another half completed project.  The fact that I see so many of my symptoms in this sub amazes me to no end, even if it should be common sense that a group of people with the same diagnosis would share common symptoms. I think I'm happy with where I am right now, but I look forward to the future. A future I hope I will remember.
0f1e89d85f55f093d7681dfa2e9c99f0df9cc8354951faa667ace1ffe4baa6f5;;;[Rant] Bitter that no one noticed;;;I'm 22 years old. Found out I have ADHD about a year ago.   Growing up, I had 2 nephews who were around my age. One was 2 months younger than me and the other 3 years younger. BOTH of them were suspected by my family of having ADHD ADD and both had medication before they were 6. Turns out neither of them had ADHD. They were just being kids.   No one suspected I had ADHD because I was "shy" and played by myself. I just didn't fit the stereotype.   No one suspected I had ADHD when I would always get bad participation marks in school or when I was often called a day dreamer by my teachers.   No one realized I had dysgraphia when my handwriting never improved  Or that I needed extra time with tests because I had a hard time with comprehension when I was on a clock.  Or when I would 90% of the time make myself sick to get out of presentations because of anxiety and RSD. Which contributed to my GERD. No red flags there.  One time I had apparently come home crying because someone made fun of my ears because they stuck out. I dont remember this incident but my mother decided it was a good idea to sign me up for otoplasty rather find the root cause of why I was so hurt by whatever was said to me. My ears actually look MORE fucked up now because the surgeons sucked ass.  No one noticed my ADHD when I didn't graduate high school despite being well behaved.  No one noticed it when I never cleaned my room, hated doing homework or rarely cared about my personal hygene. My family has hounded me about these things as though I am a lazy good for nothing. I was starting to believe it to be true.  The psychologists I saw for depression and anxiety never noticed despite all the red flags for ADHD.  No one noticed it when I fell into depression and no one noticed it when I sliced my arm open because I felt like I needed to be punished for being the lazy disgusting piece of useless shit that everyone made me feel I was.  I noticed though. I'm going to help myself the way no one else could. No one wants to believe that I am the way I am because of neurodivergence. I am amazing and bright and I make people happy and I am fucking passionate. I'm going to get a diagnosis this year and get on meds and kick the world's ass and it will all be of my own doing and no one else's.

How do you deal with it?;;;I've repeatedly gone through cycles of over and under performance in my life. When I started school, it was over performing. I could already read and do basic math, school was boring and I was way ahead of my peers. They all hated me. End of elementary school, I was under performing. I'd ignored enough math class to have fallen severely behind, I'd quit doing my English lessons so my classmates would stop feeling so inadequate, I constantly talked in class and went out of my way to garner negative attention from authority for the sake of my peers.  I over achieved in middle school again, leading to my new peers hating me. I under achieved all through high school. Consistent Cs, Ds, and Fs, much to the delight of my peers who had always cheered my failure. That was largely due to being completely behind in math and 100% unable to pay attention or do my homework at that point, rather than being intentional. I flunked out of college three separate times for the same reason. I was finally diagnosed a year ago.  Treatment has been amazing and I feel like the person I thought I was again. I'm on top of things, I have hobbies, I'm always doing well at my job. In fact, I've been promoted 3 times in the last year. Now, though, comes the part where my peers aren't happy with that. I consistently over achieve to the point that their laziness is noticeable now and it's shaking up the whole office.  Some of them outright avoid me, some of them try to belittle my achievement and act as though I work so hard because I'm not doing my job right, some are trying to start rumors and other drama. It's really starting to bring me down. I thought I loved this job. It's the first thing I've done well at in years. I don't think I'm making them feel bad. I don't make comments to them about what they're doing, unless it directly effects me, but I know our bosses are impressed with me and trying (also lazily) to push people in my direction.  I feel ostracized, I have no friends anymore. I've been so proud of myself for doing well, but now I'm starting to hate being high achieving again and I've considered quitting my medication or finding another job, but neither of those are things I want to do. My doctor says I'll either get promoted or get another job and not to worry about it, but it hurts to feel like you'll never be part of the group. It hurts even more to know that the only way to be a part of it is to intentionally do less than you are capable of, especially when you've spent so much time and energy wishing to be able to do all you're capable of. I'm so sick of feeling like this. Has anyone else had similar experiences, what did you do?

Frustrated and hoping I can find something that works.;;;Hi everyone,  I am posting on my alt as I think my boss at work knows my main account.   I have ADHD-PI, PTSD, and some form of Anxiety. I was diagnosed with ADHD-PI at age 20 and had a rough time growing up both due to undiagnosed ADHD as well as other psychological factors.  My first med was straterra - I did not notice a difference at all and experienced considerable mood issues. Discontinued before 2 months  Next was Ritalin - this had a much brighter effect for the first few weeks and then I started to experience the mood issues and inability to sleep. I had to stop it by the end of the second month because my warm, bubbly personality had turned into a sour and negative one. I also was not sleeping and that just piled onto the madness.   Next was Vyvanse - significant mood issues within the first month and I discontinued it due to the intensity of the side effects. Also did not sleep after the first couple weeks.  There was about a year lull between Vyvanse and my next attempt at medication. I was jaded by my experiences and unwilling to deal with the side effects. My job performance suffered as did my personal life. I used caffeine and green tea extract to manage it and found some decent peace.   I just recently went on Adderall XR with my new psych. We started at 20mg. I am still on that dosage and I will list what I am feeling and the side effects. I am heavily considering the discontinuation of it this weekend.   - insomnia within a few weeks. Frequently staying up to 1am when I need to be up at 7 for work. This has not stopped. Physical exercise does not bring it back under control. I can lay in bed for hours and not fall asleep.  - very light sleeping. I cannot get a deep enough sleep to wake up feeling refreshed. I am naturally a very heavy sleeper. Now, I wake up to every noise, vibration, snore of my SO, everything. This is an issue I experience when I am dealing with PTSD-related symptoms. - enhanced brain fog. I feel like my brain has been put in a very small box after the first few weeks. I cannot access the creativity (I write) and I have lost interest in other hobbies I love. I don't really have a desire to do anything. - enhanced hyper focus. I struggle to eat. I can have the food sitting in front of me at work but just keep saying "I will eat in a minute". Then an hour later I haven't. This was not an issue for the first few weeks.  - ability to focus is worse. I find myself hopping between things more with the occasional entire work day long hyperfocus. I go between being extremely effective at work (finishing multiple projects in a day) to taking a week to finish one project.  - mood is awful now. I have withdrawn into my bubble of safety (built over many years thanks to PTSD) and am keeping everyone else out. I don't want to socialize and am avoiding taking care of errands because I want to be at home. - symptoms of depression without the feeling of depression (having struggled with depression growing up, I don't have the chasm of sadness inside. just everything else that normally comes with depression). The lack of motivation and general unwillingness to do things I never minded before.  - view of others turning very pessimistic / misanthropic.  - every aspect of my organization has gone to shit. for the first couple weeks on Adderall XR I was organizing and cleaning without trouble. It was a huge improvement over the norm and made me extremely happy because I felt normal. Now, I am in a worse position than I am when unmedicated. Nothing bugs me any more, even things that always bugged me. - Paranoia is increased. I have PTSD relating to events in my childhood. I am always hyper-vigilant but am actively working on it in therapy and self awareness. I am much better than I was a couple years ago. That is until the last few weeks. I go to work and I come home. I don't like being at anywhere other than these two places.  - my time management has gotten worse. I am not sure how this was even possible... But it is.  With all of the stimulant meds I have tried, the initial 2-3 weeks was good. This is the same thing that happened with Ritalin and Vyvanse (although it was only about 2 weeks).   It is deja-vu. The third stimulant ADHD med to cause very similar side effects after the initial 2-3 weeks.   Has anyone else experienced anything like this? I much prefer the goofy and mentally disorganized person I am off meds than whatever it is that these meds turn me into. I feel more normal without medication than I do when I am on them.   I am going to attempt to schedule an appointment with my psych sooner than my next one. Her schedule is jam packed and I may have to wait until my next appointment in March.

a4bcd07e5c7f3da5c086b284684fd0ce463d71ddf4622ec7deab74db1c9e6dc5;;;So I talked to somebody at work yesterday who I know has ADHD for some help before going in for treatment and things went better than expected;;;I think he already knew. I showed him my childhood diagnosis and told him I didn't bring it up when I joined the Army (14 years going strong) because I figured it was a misdiagnosis and the docs were full of shit but with all three of my kids possibly having it (2 diagnosed the other getting complaints from kindergarten on hyperactivity and requests for me to take her to a psychologist) the odds are probably slim that the docs were wrong. I explained my worries about getting in trouble for not disclosing it way back when and how I didn't bring it up because I had not taken anything for it in years and didn't think I actually had ADHD because I did well in high school without medication. In lower grades I was diagnosed because even though my grades were fine I was a huge distraction in class messing up other kids grades and constantly getting in fights. I got all the "fighting" out of me before high school. He said I shouldn't get in trouble and went over a few things that will probably come with treatment that didn't sound too bad.   His first comment was that it isn't something that "Just goes away" his second was that my doc shouldn't have said they can't diagnose without childhood paperwork and he was diagnosed at another post as an adult. He also pointed out another coworker who has it but doesn't get treatment (not sure if he was assuming or if they have actually talked about it). The other guy is the one people refer to as "My brother" and I also call my brother openly because we are both pretty loud, move around a lot and talk too much. I kind of figured that guy has it too without anyone telling me.     Over my career I have been treated by the Army for depression and anxiety. I didn't have depression before the Army or the first few years in but I unknowingly had anxiety most my life. I found out about it while on medication for depression. That was the first time I didn't feel as anxious and before that I thought everyone's mind moved 1,000 miles an hour and everyone felt like they were sitting on the edge of their seat all the time. I didn't know that was not normal and had never really had  relaxed ever before then. It was weird but nice.   Anyways I had wanted to have the conversation but couldn't find the time. I'm glad I did though and feel a little bit better about it but slightly foolish that he probably already recognized the symptoms and knew without me needing to say anything. He is one of the better held together and more responsible people I work with. We aren't exactly close though and for a while I was worried if I talked to him he would run off and "alert the authorities" or assume I'm some type of hypochondriac because he already knows the Army has diagnosed me with anxiety, depression and OCD (from high levels of anxiety). We talked a little bit about how he uses the gym to burn off his extra energy (he goes like 3 to 4 times a day which I was already aware of).
9f0ace6cf92d4ddd123dfb037d83603edfd6160d2e3ff1f52dde201a55166fd8;;;Excellent book on ADHD and addiction;;;Those of us with ADHD are neurochemically predisposed to addiction.  Not just to drugs and alcohol but to behaviors like addictive gaming and binge eating.  We feel powerless to control our pathological behavior.  I highly recommend the book ["When Too Much Isn't Enough: Ending the Destructive Cycle of ADHD and Addictive Behavior"](https://www.amazon.com/When-Too-Much-Isnt-Enough/dp/1576836312/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1484422657&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=when+too+much+isn%27t+enough)  It's a quick read and helps explain biologically why we are prone to this type of behavior as well as how to overcome it.  *note: I was diagnosed a year ago at age 29, so this book was especially helpful in differentiating what behaviors are due to ADHD versus other factors.
03cc8c996db575ec89c5be60d94d6e370e99d2a1b8d52157af9af192150c474f;;;Giving up on school;;;I'm on academic probation. I failed first semester. It's second semester now.   My assignment was due 3 days ago. My instructor made it clear that we only get 3 days after the due date to hand it in with marks off otherwise we get an automatic zero. Deadline has passed.  I was meaning to start on this assignment but I just can't. I feel overwhelmed, depressed, lost.  I have an online test due tonight and a group project due in 2 days which I haven't even started on. It's funny, I feel so motivated to do schoolwork and I have so many dreams. But it's too hard. I'm giving up.
5cef47720ac0fa59e0a0b596b1039afc13b3d172cdec4e6da9dfd288571a69da;;;Too many numbers...;;;hey guys. so i recently started college for the 3rd time. now finally being diagnosed im starting to realize things...like me and SEEING numbers dont mix. currently i am taking statistics and these data sets are killing me...numbers EVERYWHERE. i spend 5 minutes arranging numbers to their correct place just to fuck up the whole problem because an unexpected number appears or i write 24 instead of 34. just random things that are so minuscule but can turn your entire problem wrong. now see, i know, "take ur time, read the numbers, check them off when u dont need them anymore, etc" HOWEVER i do all these things but my data sets are still screwed. im so sad because stats is the only math i find incredibly easy.......  anyways is this adhd related or is this dyslexia??? i dont have problems with words (anymore at least). i dont remember why i couldnt read property when i was a kid to be honest.  if this is adhd related, what the hell do i do? i really want to go into the science field and i feel like i didnt do well in math because i mixed up numbers quite often.
01ccaf6ba3247a518e6537cb86c2df28610625dd1f4cb045be663ea20419f1c2;;;Does Ritalin lose effectiveness over time?;;;I got diagnosed with ADHD and going on Ritalin was a game changer for me. Literally changed my life. I had few negative symptoms and was able to concentrate for once. I didn't need to constantly tap my leg when studying or get distracted or whatnot. I didn't feel a "crash" or anything after. I take 10mg and that lasts me about 3 - 4 hours which is alright for a study session.  I'm just worried that Ritalin will lose effectiveness, has anyone experienced that? I don't want to get my hopes up too high. Also I didn't experience that 'euphoric' feeling or whatnot. Does that mean I don't have ADHD?
8d0a008ba336fc7a96006abd464153d1f263f8be005b8e3b133822c3d33b5285;;;Do you guys have a test or trick to see if your meds work? Seriously getting frustrated and ready to give up.;;;So I got diagnosed last year. My usual gpa per quarter went from a 2.8-3.5+ . My parents were extremely impressed and said that it has to be the meds working. However, I still feel nothing, after trying 4 different kinds (First aderall, then vyvanse, then ritalin, now concerta).   My doctor even put me on 60mg of vyvanse and I felt nothing....  What are some tricks or tests to see if my meds are working? In class I literally just blank out still and learn nothing. It is becoming a huge issue, and I feel like I will not survive college at all once it begins. I am in desperate help.   Obviously you guys will just comment "Talk to your parents or doctors" , but I want to come here first. Thanks guys
16161969509698b33d88304770aa5df705daba40daf9f1ba70e3f4530d390f8b;;;THANK YOU!;;;This is my first post, I have commented on a few other posts and read many of other people's experiences and it has honestly helped. When I was diagnosed, I freaked out and was really down on myself for not getting help before I graduated. I was filled with regret and then when I started taking meds, I began to be motivated and actually want to go to work and get stuff done. I read through your personal experiences and in my head I'm say, "thats me" or "that's my life." Im just happy that there are more people like me than i thought there were.   Thank you for sharing your stories and questions! :)
02432e85c9f608deee9a4f9334629e7a25caa93976553df6ce37c7418c8caf94;;;You will succeed eventually, all of you. After sticking with my music hobby for 3 years I finally made my first music video;;;Sorry this is a bit long.  About 3 years ago I started listening to rap. It was good so I started making songs.  For almost 3 years, there was always an excuse to not make music. I didn't have the money to buy a microphone. I didn't have the time to get a job to make money because it took me forever to do my homework.   3 months ago I got diagnosed with ADHD and started taking Vyvanse. My grades jumped a letter grade and I only had to do about half as much work. So now I have a few hours a day. I'm spending about 40 hours a week playing Grand Theft Auto and some other video games, feeling like I'm wasting my life. I need to change something.  When I got diagnosed, the doctor told me about how my verbal intelligence was so much better than my ability to focus, that I would be able to do anything language-related- IF I really wanted to.  I took this as a sign that I should start taking music seriously.  1 month later, I decided to finally do what I have been putting off for years- getting a proper setup and learning how to record. My mom was very surprised that I actually took the time to do something (she has not exactly been supportive of my creative pursuits- in fact, she will often tell me about how stupid I am for wasting my time with music).   2 days ago, I had finished a song- the first song I am truly proud of- and I decided I needed to make a music video.  I am sure a lot of you have heard about how people with ADHD are more creative. So I was reading about how people usually make music videos. They hire:  1) A director  2) An assistant director  3) A lighting FX guy  4) A sound FX guy  Etc., etc.  I thought about this for a while. *How am I going to make a good music video for free?* I was quite perplexed for a while.  Then I realized. I can just put my phone camera right up against my alarm clock and hit the record button.  **So to say to all of you who have just gotten diagnosed, or feel like you're worthless, or you are "too stupid" to do X, or you can't focus long enough to do Y, you're not. You will reach your dreams. It will take time. But you and your goals are worth it.**  What else did I learn from this?  **If not for my ADHD-style idea bouncing, I would have never come up with a nearly as impressive music video.**  **TL;DR you'll get where you want to go.**  [Video in case you want to see what my ADHD mind thinks like and as a reward for you getting this far] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0LTpEhAR3k&amp;t=9s)
8d53e14ccc3fd372d1706ab5e8a066d5c371491fb0767f72ce67e9a445dc7476;;;A couple questions about Strattera;;;Hi there guys, I'm a long time lurker. I was diagnosed pretty young with ADHD and was medicated with Adderall up until I was 14, to which I made the decision to stop. I decided to start up again (22) and got a prescription to strattera. Now I'm having some pretty bad side effects. I'm two days in, and my testicles are constantly aching, and I haven't pissed right since I started.  Obviously maintaining an erection is almost impossible. Are these side effects that eventually go away?
66c837eafd3cf189817b7364c60f33beb42c451e34f821fba3f2d24beb20643b;;;Finding Dory made me realize that I'm not happy floating through life;;;I'm an adult male, and as pathetic as it may sound, the movie Finding Dory made me cry.   I watched the movie this week with my mom and was emotional for a good 1/3 of the movie. There were times when I was tempted to pause the movie and explain to her how I felt, and how I felt a connection with the film, but I kept my mouth shut and became engrossed in watching a forgetful Blue Tang struggle with her disorder.  My mother, a well educated woman, believes that I just need to buckle down and work harder to overcome the pitfalls I face. Don't get me wrong, she has worked hard to help me, but believes that ADHD is something that shouldn't be treated with medication.   Watching this movie (and reading success stories here) makes me want to find a medication that truly works for me. I'm currently taking Adderall XR, which can make me very emotional (probably why I cried watching an animated movie) but it's something I would happily live with, if it worked the way I need it to.   The problem now is living with the realization that there may be a treatment out there for me that actually works and I don't know what to do, or where to start.   Unfortunately, my doctor is not someone that I trust to help me through this journey. When I told him that I was diagnosed in grade school and was medicated through most of high school, he didn't believe me. Because he assumed I wanted to simply score Adderall he made me get tested again. When the results came back, he begrudgingly placed me on Adderall XR. My fear is that he will make things harder for me and my ability to access the medication I need.  I'm tired of living like this though, I want my own success story with my own Aha! moment. I want to know what it feels like when the fog is lifted and the burden you've carried for years is washed away.   I want to wake up with tears of joy knowing that I can have a successful day at work without worrying if I'll meet a deadline. I want to be able to pay bills on time and clean my house one room at a time, but I just don't know where to start.
3185d9f3d6e8fcbf1fe7e9a8d15c23ec0e0589a9fef068ce6619edab263b50a7;;;Growing up with ADHD and hypersensitivity has made my life very hard.;;;First off, I never got help nor the diagnosis when I was a kid, I was mainly ostracized by the other kids as too whimpy or emotional, the teachers didnt care how badly I was bullied, bad school record, never able to make a proper choice always...  Seriously my life has been so far really bad. I remember I became so emotionally unstable that I live manically for many years cause I could manipulate my emotions. But then, disaster struck, someone got under my skin, was super negative, and then I developed intrusive thoughts where I imagined how they judged me and told me I was a failure, and I could not fight these "voices" off, whenever I would do well, the thoughts would just correct me so that I couldnt do as well next time. and there I was, forced to see myself break apart right in front of me with no one to help me, I couldnt even explain it cause the voices told me I couldnt. It got so bad that I was terrified of spilling my coffee when I got it. took me seven long and painful years just to finally be able to go to college. took the easy route as that was the only one that worked for me. I am so lost... I am almost 30, my heart is broken from all those lost possibilities I have had, and I have nowhere to go.  part of me wants to go crazy and start ruining things, I am emotionally stunted as thats the only way for me to go about without getting hurt. I am almost becoming an alcoholic. I got nothing in life. I cant even let myself think too much due to the shit ive emtionally gone through.  I am so lost.

I have asked her about what an accountability group does in the past.) exact quotes in italics.   Her: would you like to join an accountability group?   Me: no thanks. It wouldn't motivate me.   Her: what motivates you?   Me: *only extreme and immediate consequences.. I don't know... electro shock therapy? Lol! Let me explain.. I was recently diagnosed with ADHD. Being unmotivated is kind of a defining characteristic for me and people like me.*  Her: *have you ever tried to change your thought processes around it? Like do affirmations that say you ARE motivated and ARE committed? I know it sounds kinda silly but they do actually work! It's not overnight for sure but it can literally rewire your brain!*   Me: *can it regrow pieces that aren't there?* (I'm LOL'ing at this point...)  Her: *you can create new neural pathways in the brain! It's like a muscle- always changing and growing!*  Who knew? 😂😂.   She means well I know-  but I was just diagnosed 2 weeks ago and these types of interactions are all still new to me. It was probably a rookie mistake even mentioning ADHD but you live you learn lol!   Cheers.
1c746e006db799d4df9c7e51a33d0352ac3a3cc40998bd6c7cbc57b6ffe8fc0e;;;I find myself struggling with reading on Vyvanse: Is it normal?;;;I've been taking it for a couple of weeks now. The first day it seemed to be working as intended; increased attention (slightly), and it felt a little easier to get things done etc.   Few days later: I noticed i had a harder time reading. It was jumpy and choppy. Harder to comprehend what i was reading, and got stuck on--not to complicated words quite often. At times finishing a sentence; confused with what i had read; to realize i had put one word in-front of another, or simply misread. This is something i normally don't struggle with.  However: Its been a couple of weeks now, and it's still persistent. I tried taking a few days of (4); it didn't help. I can also find my self zoning out easier, you know when you literally lose focus; like a camera, and get left glaring into, whatever is in-front of you. Anyone recognize this?  Got in contact with my psychiatrist; got her assistant. She said it could be a problem with my vision, something i had already ruled out: Seeing my psychiatrist in a week roughly.  TL;DR: Hard time reading on Vyvanse; get words mixed up, or put them in the wrong order - it's choppy.

I've been on ritalin now for about 5 weeks or so and have settled on about 40mg, spaced out through four pills day. I've noticed that the effect has ... moderated somewhat after the first few weeks and am wondering how the guys in this forum deal with getting to a tolerance level with adhd drugs more generally.   I'm thinking of things like not taking them on weekends, or taking less some days for instance.  Does this help to keep the effect at optimal when we take them during the week?

I had a pacifier until I was 4 and a soft doll that I stroked constantly like I was playing a guitar (her dress was silky). Then she was taken away and I started carrying around satin pillow cases to rub. I also loved silly putty and sticky poster tack--I'd play with them incessantly and wouldn't go to bed without continuing to play with them, then wake up with them in my hair.  I'm still fidgety. I wear lots of jewelry to play with and keep little rocks and rubber animals at my desk at work. I've even made little beaded rosary-like things with all sorts of different beads on them just to fidget with.  Anyone else a lifelong fidgeter?
a4bcd07e5c7f3da5c086b284684fd0ce463d71ddf4622ec7deab74db1c9e6dc5;;;So I decided to write out a list of all of my hobbies over a few years...;;;TLDR: I think I have too many uncompleted "hobbies" the list is a little embarrassing.  My boyfriend said to me earlier this year "I'm kind of curious what your next obsession will be..." I was a little irritated and we argued a little bit over how many "hobbies" I've wasted money on. One result was me going into a baking frenzy because he said I wasted money on a bread machine I never use. Of course "I do too use it!" and I had to prove him wrong. This resulted also in a binge eating problem (regained about 20lbs) because I had to eat all of my creations too...   Anyways I started a list on a notebook on my phone today out of curiosity (which I might or might not share with my therapist when I go in but not sure if I want her to think I'm completely crazy). I added some notes to my list but I'll cut most of them out for brevity it's not all inclusive but a good start:   - Tsum tsums  - Legos - Tennis - Soccer - Racketball - Running  (5k and half marathons) - Swimming - Boogie boarding  - Marvel (comics, movies, etc) - Reading (fiction and non fiction) - Adult coloring books - Pokémon go - Hiking  - Hiking the Appalachian trail  - Exercise guides /workouts  - Camping - Dice games - Video games - Game of Thrones (books, show, theories, youtube) - The Hunger Games - Theme parks - Vaping (mods, making my own juice, etc) - DBZ - Star trek - Any TV series w/ zombies - Outerspace (I want a telescope) - D&amp;D - Magic the gathering - Fidget toys (for anxiety) - Candles - Cooking (baking, bread machine, ice cream machine, cotton candy machine, waffles, chocolate fondue, chocolate molds, healthy eating, low carb, clean eating, making my own cookbooks, buying cookbooks, deep frying, cookies, getting a degree in nutrition).     I'm both disturbed and laughing about how crazy this list looks especially considering a lot of them are in the last decade or so (some have been lifelong though) and this doesn't include everything. I haven't been treated for ADHD since I was about 11 or 12. I'm bringing in my childhood diagnosis in a few weeks looking for some help. I've been getting treated for depression/anxiety and to a lesser degree occasional OCD. I'm not on any type of meds for anything right now. The doctor   didn't want to diagnose/treat ADHD without childhood proof. I'm thinking maybe ADHD is causing my anxiety and anxiety leads to OCD which then drops off into debilitating depression. I know my anxiety leads to depression.   Anyone have words of wisdom or similar hobby issues? Anyone else care to share their exhaustive list of hobbies?
c28d4e37d48841c303c15715d807903a31cf21dfbf6733dbd2ffd250ebf61719;;;I fall in love very easily and tend to obsess over recent crushes. Is this normal with ADHD?;;;I'm 34. My previous relationship ended pretty badly (I'll spare you the details) about 7 months ago. Spent this time focusing on my career and studyings, and on shedding the weight I'd gained when I was dating.  I finally feel confident enough to get out of my shell. Had a few matches on Happn (it's popular where I live), one of them really clicked. We messaged for hours, talked like old friends. I got her number, asked her out without thinking twice, we had some light dinner and a wonderful chat. Dropped her off at home and we kissed goodbye.  So far, so good, right? Not for my brain, it ain't. Now I can't stop thinking about her. I keep obsessing over how long should I wait to text. If I should text or not. What I should write. Whether she's into me or not. How soon should I ask her on a second date. Where I should take her. Etc. Etc. Etc.  I went out with friends on Friday and I couldn't focus on the conversation because I was thinking about her. Forgot my meds yesterday and wasted the entire day on this. Went to sleep and _actually got depressed_ thinking things might not work out.  Thing is: When I don't like a girl, I can't bring myself to even talk to her. When I like a girl, it just explodes inside my brain. There's no middle ground. I feel the same kind of hyperfocus as a new activity, a new computer game, or anything that gives me a dopamine rush. And I also dread the day I'll lose interest.  Anyway, I'm trying to pull myself together and let things happen on their own pace for once. But it's hard, so hard. Even with my meds.  **TL;DR: Obsessing with girl after one date. Suspect it's ADHD-related.**
31803c13eb22ec1345723446e14ac282b59b414946593d79d27c01ca5664177c;;;If you go to get tested for "ADHD", will that also cover ADD?;;;I know that it's ADHD-PI, ADHD-PH, and ADHD-C now, but I'm sure that a lot of psychiatrists are still using the old way. I assumed they were using the new way, so when I went in I just kept saying "ADHD".   The testing was clicking on shapes as they appeared on the screen, matching up to shapes a few shapes ago, and measuring my level of movement while doing these games. They said I did above average for my age and that I didn't have ADHD, but *did that cover ADD?* They didn't use any of the latest PI/PH/C terms.   Fidgeting is entirely a part of hyperactive-type, as well as impatience, and the testing was 6 hours of really easy stuff- it seemed to be for testing patience. I swear that my dad has ADHD, and he was really frustrated the whole time because of how impatient he is, so he pretty much failed the tests without even taking them. As the tests went on I could literally feel the energy and focus draining from my body.   When looking at the symptoms for inattentive vs hyperactive, I definitely see 10/10 of the inattentive in my everyday life, but only 4/10 of the hyperactive. When taking ADHD medication I move a lot faster, I am in the present, all of my problems are swept away ("depression" as well), and the symptoms drop like flies.   **TL;DR - Could saying "ADHD" instead of "ADD" when looking for testing lead to a misdiagnosis?**  EDIT: ["Kids with ADD might fly under the radar because they aren’t bursting with energy and disrupting the classroom. Instead, they often appear shy, daydreamy or off in their own world."](https://www.understood.org/en/learning-attention-issues/child-learning-disabilities/add-adhd/difference-between-add-adhd)  "Symptoms of the inattentive type of ADHD are less noticeable compared to symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity. Unfortunately, as a result, many individuals with the predominantly inattentive subtype of ADHD are often overlooked."  EDIT 2: If I don't get any euphoria or "high" from ADHD medication, is that a sign of low dopamine/ADHD? All I notice are the energy, motivation, etc. when taking them. Never any kind of addiction, dependency, zombie mode, or high. I've tried three different medications and I can say the same for all of them.
23cd65244de5cbfad33f48596c8add039d31188855e5d3184219ed619ec70ad6;;;I feel like my brain is screaming when I'm not listening to anything;;;Just some background: I've been diagnosed with ADHD for about 8 months now, I started with a medication that stimulated dopamine in the brain or something and that didn't work so I swapped over to elvanse and it's perfect.   This started since before that however, when I am on my own or I'm not listening to anything like music or a tv I feel like the voice in my head is screaming, like I'm being told off but I don't know what it's saying, it makes me feel nervous and so I have to put something on to take the focus away and that usually stops it. It still happens now, not all the time, usually around midday and I'm not really doing anything.   Also I'm not sure if this is related but when I go out and drink sometimes when I come home and go to bed I feel very clearly like everyone i went out with that night is in my room partying, so I wake up to join them and it goes away and obviously no one is there. It's like a lucid dream where I feel like I'm sleeping but I can hear everything going on around me.  Is this an ADHD thing, does anyone else feel like this too?
7d790b310f023fed70f7c5f94aa32be6ff6b36d57691c9070d7b82f63efdcbc1;;;Mentally exhausted...;;;I don't know why or how I do this to myself everyday, but I'm just mentally exhausted. Everyday I have to constantly fight myself just to do ANY work at work. It always feels like its round 12 in a boxing match and Im just fighting my own lack of motivation. I physically FEEL (minor pain in my stomach when I think about doing work) the disappointment, lack of motivation/discipline to do any work. I feel worthless, annoyed, drained, lazy, bored, etc. Maybe its the job itself (office job, but wasnt much different when I worked in construction), or maybe its not. Either way its slowly killing me inside. Some moments I can find the motivation to do some work, most times I can't. Yet I can't even find the motivation to find a new job. My mind just cant/wont. Mentally Im in constant purgatory, just going along in this depressing routine. Feel stuck. I only ever feel this at work. Im mentally unable, due to (diagnosed) anxiety, to find a new career anyways.   I don't know what to do at this point. This daily routine is slowly killing me, and I probably have to wait another week to even be approved for the Adhd test I was recommend for. Sorry for the mini-rant, but I feel like just walking away from work and never coming back, and that Ill honest to God never find a job I enjoy (all while juggling finances).   Im so sick of it all, I don't know if this physical feeling of lack of motivation is ADHD or not, but fuck me it sucks so bad.  Even mental "tricks" (lists, just count to five and do it, etc.) dont work as I cant even find the motivation to do those. I just dont get it. I feel like Im even worse than most of those with ADHD on this sub, like Im mentally on a tier even below most of other people with ADHD.

We were asked to tell a story we have never been able to tell before. I decided to make a very personal piece about what it is like to live as an illustrator with Attention Deficit Disorder. The center of the illustration shows my work space, the boarder of the illustration depicts a comic showing the cycles of procrastination, distraction, anxiety, extreme frustration, and desperation that comes from even trying to complete a simple task while suffering from A.D.D. The work-space illustration shows exactly how I organize my dinning room when I am working on artwork.  See Full Artwork Here: https://www.behance.net/gallery/48990729/LIGHT-GREY-ART-LAB-TOBEYOU
d306ab7dc85bfac774fb1be3d982ddb26fb3ab2766ad73fffba8add82badd6b5;;;Perception of time skewed, the world is in slow motion?;;;First off apologies if this is not the right place to be posting it as I am still awaiting diagnosis and realize this may be a fluke of my own brain, or maybe I don't even have adhd but something else similar? BUT, here goes.  For a long time I've felt like time moved exceptionally slow (except, occasionally, at times when it goes too fast) and that I am the only normal-speed person around me. There are times when this gets intensified and I cannot handle how slow everything is! Music near always seems too slow; when I put it on 1.5 speed, it finally sounds 'right'. Things I don't want to do drag on so so long. For some reason adderall fixes this and I'll feel like I'm actually on the same wavelength as everyone else... if that makes sense?  Has anyone else experienced something remotely similar or know what causes it?
5190544eb62e978b93f95bacbe105f619bf102b722a4ff44a6331634ddccf416;;;[Rant] Im fed up, pissed off, and kind of depressed.;;;So, im kind of fed up with a few things. First of all is switching medicines. I have gone through so many medicines so far, and ive lost track tbh. They all either dont work, have TERRIBLE side effects, or just suck in general. Right now im on strattera and it makes me feel nauseas, depressed, CONSTANTLY tired, and has stopped working. Im doing terrible in school, and my parents are pissed. Im failing one class, because it was virtual high school (on my own time, online class; Terrible choice for being ADHD) and the system doesnt work out for me. Other than that im getting B's and C's in my classes, and my parents are like "your too smart for this" and telling me "I understand what its like to be ADHD you just have to focus and youll do great in school, i think i had adhd when i was a kid," and no matter how hard i try i cant seem to convince them that its not as easy as "just focusing." Thats like telling someone with narcolepsy to JUST NOT FALL ASLEEP. IT DOESNT WORK THAT WAY. Anyway, they took away all electronics for me which means im not allowed on  my phone, pc, TV, netflix,etc. So im sneaking on here just because i was feeling fed up, depressed, and needed to vent my feelings. I wish i had someone i could talk to who would honestly listen, understand, and just help me through this. Dont get me wrong, i have some great friends, its just that A. they dont understand what its like for me and B. i feel like they would judge me.   School is getting to be pretty depressing for me because for some reason i feel like i JUST CANT FOCUS ON ANYTHING. I often feel unmotivated when it comes to schoolwork, and cant do it.   Luckily it doesnt effect my job, although i love what i do, so thats part of it (if anyone is curious im a small engine mechanic/electric vehicle repair, i fix motorcycles, generators, lawn mowers, those electric razor scooters, electric weed wackers, etc.) but still.   Do any of you guys just suddenly feel depressed and wish you had someone to talk to about it?   Anyway, thats pretty much it for my rant. I am feeling a bit better now that i got that all out, but no clue how long thats going to last  TL;DR: my ADHD really shows in this post, i rant about countless things, and there is no way to understand without reading my entire post  EDIT: My adhd showing again - i completely forgot about this part: I feel tired all the time. I could get 15 hours of sleep, and STILL FEEL GODDAMN TIRED AND IT PISSES ME OFF. Sometimes i just REALLY wish i could be normal.   EDIT 2: I sometimes just feel like my brain needs an off switch. It really just keeps going. And whenever my parents get into a serious discussion with me (usually them yelling at me over grades) i will start fidgeting with something. I always fidget, but when im nervous or upset, i tend to fidget a LOT. They will yell at me for it (usually my dad). I never even realize im doing it, its all subconcious. Anyway, it just feels like my brain is always on, im always thinking about something, and its really really overwhelming. I need a mental break. I never did drugs, but often i can see the appeal of pot.   I always need to be doing something too; Ive recently discovered audiobooks and absolutely love them. My parents think im like addicted to my phone, but really it is more like its something i can do. Most of the time id rather be doing something with my friends or flying RC aircraft, but its winter, and 3 of my good friends are hermits, and the other 2 have full time jobs, and when they arent working, chances are i am. So on my free time ill watch youtube or something, or even just listen to music or an audiobook, and my parents will yell at me for it, saying im on my phone too often, but they just dont/wont understand.   Edit 3: Also, i think i piss a lot of people off. Especially in school. I feel like i try too hard to be funny, make stupidass jokes, and ive literally had people tell me in class "you just need to shut the fuck up" and often ill say something, then later think to my self "why the fuck did i say that?"
54e30af349aad560c948cf51118c58fb523fffb5240e3aaf32d93bb8f77e88ea;;;Advice needed, am I being unreasonable? My BF's brother and SIL are using Adderall "for a boost".;;;**WARNING: Long as fuck message. Tl;DR AT THE BOTTOM!**   **Personal note**: I was diagnosed at 7 and refused to take medicine. I adopted several helpful, albeit unusual, coping mechanisms to help me adapt in school, work, and social exchanges. I've now been on Adderall (10mg 2x day) for 1 year and it has helped tremendously with the "brain chatter" and "channel flipping". I can't believe I went nearly 18 years without it. The first day I took it and drove to campus as per usual. Upon arrival, my friend noted that I *'looked peaceful'* and I was. It has been nothing but helpful, but I know that the coping mechanisms I developed previously are also a huge help.  Before I was medicated, I adopted color coded stickie notes, multiple white boards, repeated lists in every notebook, and multiple phone reminders. I got through the first semester of my return on sheer willpower (and reminders!) alone. I was home schooled previously and didn't do so well when I was younger. Now I am part of 2 on campus clubs, taking 16-18+ credit hours, conducting neurodevelopmental research, URL (undergraduate research leaders), ESA (Engaged scholarship award), and still somehow find time to make the President's list [straight A's!] Through time and hard work, my 2.4 has risen to a 3.1 and I'm on track to graduate with honors. I was already on track to do so without the medicine, but the medicine helps a lot. The important thing, in my mind, is to know that I can, and have, do without. *Medicine is not a magic 'fix all' pill*, and I wish more people understood that.    **Backstory of Problem**: My BF's brother is a medical graduate from Mexico and is a fully licensed and legal doctor (in Mexico). The U.S. has unusual requirements and earning a license here can be a pain, but he was born here and simply went to Mexico due to cost - a risk, but he's happy with his decision. He's been having difficulty studying. He prefers video games and socializing with his wife, usual stuff. I heard through the grapevine that he was interested in trying Adderall because he's "heard amazing things" and "feels like he might have ADHD".   This was originally offensive to me because he definitely does not have ADHD. I know adderall can be prescribed for a variety of reasons, and I am trying hard to not be judgemental, but he doesn't lack the ability to retrieve large amounts of information, or forget necessities/basic every-day responsibilities, doesn't experience hardships with impulse control, had no idea what "brain chatter" was, has a ridiculously solid attention span, and just *clearly* does not have ADHD.  Not to imply that people with ADD/ADHD aren't intelligent or articulate, but their family specifically is abnormally smart. So, I met with him to help him study - ADHD or not, learning some studying tips is beneficial! I attempted to take a proactive route instead of getting bitter.  During the study session, he explained his issues, concerns, how his brain works (my questioning, he is very open), and previous study tactics. I offered a few suggestions and they were met with:  - "yeah, no. I don't like doing that because...." - "See, I tried that before when I was younger...." - "No, I don't want to do that". - "I'm not willing to try that".  It then finished with "I really think the Adderall will help me do what I need to do". Okay, can't argue with the Dr. I did warn him about the possibility of medication induced psychosis, but he's aware, he's a fucking Dr! Okay, fine, this is his decision. He finally admitted that he does not have ADHD but thinks he would benefit from adderall as "a boost". He's under the impression that Adderall will *make him do what he doesn't want to do*.    I politely tell him that I disagree, but at the end of the day it is his life. So he goes and "fills his script", which interestingly enough, a P.A signed off on. I at that point didn't believe that he actually went to see a Dr, because where I live, P.A's are not allowed to prescribe schedule 2 drugs. This is not something I can or will argue, but it fuels my fire.  **CUT SCENE to 3 days on his script / THE PROBLEM**  My BF, BF's brother, their mother, and the brother's wife and were all at the mother's house. For half an hour I am sitting there hearing about how wonderful and great Adderall is, how he's been so productive, cleaned his desk, and just feels like superman overall. In the middle of his spiel, he says that on Monday and Wednesday he's not going to take his pills so that he "can feel like himself". In addition, those days that he isn't taking the Adderall, he's going to give to *his wife* so that *"she can join [him] in the gym"*.   Okay, so what happens if you stop taking the Adderall, do you stop being productive? Do you stop going to the gym? Do you stop doing what you need to do because you're out of Adderall? *NO.*  The conversation then moves forward where there is A TOAST to Adderall. A FUCKING TOAST! They all clink their glasses and are so happy that Mr. Dr is finally doing what he needs to do and thanks the Adderall for it. Nevermind that on Adderall he could have chosen to be unproductive, lets celebrate the fucking drugs and not his recent boost in productivity and willingness to do what needs to get done.   **Tl;DR**: Very articulate and well read Dr Admits to not having ADHD but receives a script for Adderall anyway in order to get a 'boost', has no interest in developing other coping mechanisms, got the script incorrectly, takes days off "to feel like himself", shares his script with his wife so she will "join [him] at the gym", and the entire family TOASTED to adderall^clink while I'm sitting there dumbfounded.   ..... am I just being sensitive?!
e1163926bb6cc1f601c395c2854e785c71dc8f8e7da7cf177f3726d81906e51b;;;My ADHD lets me obsess about everything that goes wrong - here's how I fight that/ how you can stay positive while addressing the shit that happens;;;Hey guys! In this sub we love to complain - whether it's rants, or tearful posts about our relationships and jobs not working, or even snarky one liners about "oops lost the keys again, how typical". And there's nothing wrong with that -- it's great to have a community that gets it and can offer support. (And I do it plenty too)   But I've found myself feeling just as shitty after rants as I do before sometimes. I think I'm part its because I'm such a perfectionist and it's discouraging to get to the end of the day and realize nothing got done. Or to see how hard I worked for something to go poorly and give up on the future. But I don't like that me. And more seriously I felt like that version of me was a really shitty person to be in a relationship with.   So here's what I did:   When something goes downhill I acknowledge it. I write it down or say it out loud and I tell myself that yeah, that thing REALLY sucked. But I'll try to think of good things related to it, and other good things in my life. And I'll write those down too. It doesn't mean the sucky thing is less sucky but it does mean that I see that my life is more balanced. When I was really struggling I made myself write down one good thing each day on a sticky note and put it on my wall, even if it was as simple as "answered a question right" "got my eyeliner just right" "talked to a new person".   I found that I unloaded a lot on my partners. With my ex, I really resented being his therapist all the time and it wore me down to date someone who was only ever unhappy -- I'm seeing this again right now with a close friend who only ever tells me about stuff going bad. I didn't want to chase my current BF away by being negative Nancy all the time. So we started using Rose-thorn- bud:  When I complain about something I started with a rose -- something good that happened. Then I told him about the thorn -- whatever it was that was bothering me. And I finished with a bud -- something I'm looking forward to in the future. It made me acknowledge and share my triumphs with him which has made our relationship stronger. Now we aren't as strict about the system, but I always get to smile when I get a text from him that says "I have a rose for you."   I've tried to move away from letting my frustration and failures rule my day, which has been hard since I'm newly diagnosed and in a hyper competitive grad program where everyone seems miserable constantly. There's a lovely poem I like that basically comes down to saying "don't feel bad for feeling bad. You've got bad days and good days and you never know what's next so take it as it comes and don't worry too much". I don't know about you guys but once I feel shitty I start feeling angry and guilty for feeling shitty in the first place. Super fun. Poem: https://allpoetry.com/poem/8534703-The-Guest-House-by-Mewlana-Jalaluddin-Rumi  So tell me Reddit! What are the good things in your life right now? What little triumphs have you had recently? What's your rose-thorn-bud? I want to celebrate your successes with you - even if they aren't huge right now.   Tl;dr: acknowledge good things and bad things. Stop feeling guilty about feeling bad when stuff goes wrong. When sharing bad things with friends and family, also let them share in your happy moments.
a54fad958bb471abbed07dba6cf0bc045b75dc7e2549735e5bb5989c9426fa67;;;How do I stop 'freezing up' at home so often?;;;To start off, I'm not entirely sure if I have ADD or not, but I'm soon to be in the process of getting diagnosed.  Regardless, I've always had this issue since I was in middle school, up until I dropped out of high school (I never fully learned how to cope with it). I would fill my day with random things like video games (they've always been in my life; my ideal time killer), or looking up completely random but mostly useful things on my computer.  Now, I'm in the working world, and even on my days off I just find myself constantly 'freezing' in thought. I'm trying to be productive, less video games, less time wasting, but thinking is literally paralyzing me. I've tried just getting up and organizing things - doing things, but once I run into a problem, it's back to sitting and thinking. What can I do about this? I find myself thinking about thousands of things in a day, financial things, hobbies I want to pick up, brilliant ideas I don't have the resources for, dreams, how much I dread going to work, the possibilities are endless. I'm extremely open-minded, but thinking is keeping me from doing. Would medication help? I hate the thought of taking pills because I'm on a plant based/mostly natural diet, but it doesn't seem to be getting me anywhere. I can't even find the motivation to workout.  TL;DR: My nonstop thoughts are paralyzing me, and I can't shake the thoughts long enough to do anything aside from work, and wait for work. What's a good way to get out of this vicious cycle?  EDIT:  The main reason I want to fix this is because I feel like I'm disappointing everyone in my life, and mostly myself by not living up to my full potential. I have all of these awesome ideas, but I'm lacking the follow through because I'm driving myself crazy staying in my mind. AND I've noticed the biggest problem seems to be I feel stagnant at home, but lack the motivation to do anything before or after work unless it's completely necessary. Sometimes not even then.
9466a8a151fff3baa00daaf779f8a86212b94e86361315c5133692a4f1848fdf;;;Autism and ADHD;;;So... after discussion and thought, I may have autism as well as ADHD. I have my assessment for ADHD tomorrow, as I'm not yet diagnosed, and they do screen for things like autism at the same time as well. I do know the symptoms of autism well, but I just don't know if ADHD negates any autistic traits, as some traits in the two disorders are quite contrasting/ conflicting. Like I am very talkative and outgoing, which I would say is an ADHD thing, as I get side tracked and end up rambling, but with autism, from what I can tell, you are less inclined to speak and be overwhelming. There are several others I can think of, such as with ADHD you often change your interests frequently, but with autism, again, from what I can tell, you have a long sustained interest.   So what traits do people with ASD and ADHD have, which a person with only one of said disorders wouldn't have?  *Also, a question which doesn't really suit this sub, but someone might know, so might as well ask. Does high functioning autism refer to the intellectual ability of the person, or the severity of the autism (like it doesn't cause them as many problems)?*
5190544eb62e978b93f95bacbe105f619bf102b722a4ff44a6331634ddccf416;;;My first job has been going great!;;;Oh i just realized. On the 29th i will have had my job for 6 months :smile: i have so far earned over $1,500 (keep in mind im a 16 year old high school student working part time) and more than half of that is saved in my bank account never to be touched again :D (hey, thats like $900 towards my college funds) and it honestly feels great to have a job &amp; my own money to spend.  For those of you wondering, i work as a small engine mechanic at a local bicycle/moped/small engine repair shop. I mainly fix electric stuff, such as electric Razor scooters, Electric bicycles, Electric go-karts, electric lawn tools, etc., but i also work on a decent amount of engines too. My favorite thing I've worked on is a 1972 Yamaha AT1 125CC 2-Stroke enduro, i just love classic bikes, and im a big Yamaha fan too.   Im making over minimum wage, and the best part? My boss is pretty lenient about when i come in to work; He doesnt get angry if im late, or if i ever have to skip a day, so long as i let him know - PERFECT for someone with ADHD.  I think the reason im doing so well is because im doing something i love. I have always been into taking things apart and fixing things. I grew up in a mechanic family, and enjoy working on things. So, its all going great :D
5646a13c6020b7ddd790cce8e586b4223985ad702119f611f827e03509973d32;;;Thoughts on differences between Inattentive and Hyperactive ADHD;;;Just over a year ago I was diagnosed with ADHD-PI ("primarily inattentive"). I was 31. The "inattentive" designation puzzled me because it didn't *seem* like ADHD, but it also explained why I went undiagnosed for so long. Since being diagnosed I've understood my brain better and better but struggled initially to relate to the stereotypical "hyperactivity/impulsivity" that gets attached so often to ADHD. Dr. Russell Barkley, a leading researcher on ADHD, maintains that ADHD shouldn't be thought of in terms of subtypes. I believe that as well, particularly since the hyperactivity of adults with ADHD looks drastically different than it does in children. It's more internalized, which is consistent with the inattentive designation.    Personally, I think these subtypes are better understood as expressions. As an example, though I carry the label "inattentive" I'm still hyper/impulsive deep down, as I'm always doing something "productive" even when I could and should be relaxing.   At its core, though, what do you think makes the difference between these subtypes or expressions?    I'm working mostly off lectures by Dr. Barkley and what I've read here, but it seems inattentive ADHD'ers describe their lives before treatment as "being in a fog." And while Barkley explains that children with ADHD lack the ability to self-soothe, I found that cloudy world of thoughts relaxing. Perhaps the difference between these subtypes/expressions is whether or not someone can self-soothe? As a kid I read a lot and was pretty daydreamy. I can imagine this as a way of dealing with a broken dopamine system. When a task didn't grab my brain's attention I went into that inner world of thoughts – problem solved.    Is this typical for those with the inattentive subtype? What's it like for those with the hyperactive subtype?   TL;DR:   ADHD subtypes – are they explained better as *expressions* than a specific type of ADHD? And what do you think causes these differences on a neurological level?
c72a9d2d16334a93efb68015bf54ebc69a587d253efb75047fffb842cd830774;;;Dream-like state;;;Hello, this is my first post here on this forum, and really the first time I have actually attempted to communicate with other people who are diagnosed with ADHD.    I want to know if anyone else here feels as if they are in what I can only describe as a permanent dream-like state. It is not necessarily mental exhaustion, inability to think clearly, tiredness or euphoria (although I often feel those too after intensive work and they only manage to worsen the effect). Maybe it is what you all describe as "Brain fog" but I am still unsure. The lucidity of it intensifies as the day goes on, being at its weakest in the morning and being at its strongest when I go to bed.    I can only describe it as: "feeling as though I am in a dream to the point that I feel like things around me aren't real and that I am disconnected from reality." It's the kind of odd, lucid feeling that I, and I imagine other people, use to check if they are actually dreaming (if that makes any sense, the sort of sensation "check" to see if things are "real".) It feels exactly like that, but less intense.   I could feel it seeping in when I was in grade-school, I was medicated back then, and it has been with me since. I remember taking actual notice as to how different I felt, even describing it to my parents as feeling as if I was on drugs. I've had this sensation so long, that I have forgotten what it is like to feel normal, and I even sometimes forget that it is even there.   Do other people feel this too? Is it actually linked to ADHD and, if it is, is there anything I can do to make myself feel better? Is this at all similar to Derealization disorder? I hate to sound melodramatic here, but I often feel as if people and things around me aren't real. Do you think this "disconnect" is at all linked with dysthymia, lack of motivation, social anxiety, lack of empathy and even sapped mental ability?   Thoughts?

She didn't give an official diagnosis to me or my mom, and brushed on the idea of medication, but said that continued therapy would be very effective. This was very frustrating for me, because it seemed like she wanted us to come back to pay for more sessions before she explained exactly what was going on. I told this to my parents, but they said that we should go with what she said. Therapy was ineffective, she tried very basic talking/coping techniques that might have been effective with me 10 years ago. I explained that medication would be more effective at this point, but they were hesitant to believe me. I am going back to see the therapist weekly now. Any suggestions?

Many thanks to you all for your posts, It helped me realize my own situation. I was put on 10mg Adderall XR just to start with. I understand this is your basic 'upper'. Should I be noticing changes immediately, or will it take a few days for the meds to kick in and begin their full effect? Much appreciated.

For example, I met with a faculty member today at my college, about taking my exam in a private room, and she started asking me all these questions about my diagnosis (she did not know what my diagnosis was), and I got frustrated, when she asked me if my medication was working. I got frustrated and told her, "I don't know" And she said "Well, how can you not know, you should be able to tell!.. etc. etc." And at that moment I felt like I was going to cry.. so I stopped talking. The thing is... I felt frustrated not sad. It's like my emotions don't express how I really feel - I am currently being diagnosed for ADHD, because I do have issues with memory, concentration, listening etc. I have been taking 20 mg x2 a day (40 mg total)... but I honestly do not feel like it's working. Like I feel NOTHING. I'm not sure what to do.. because isn't there a maximum dose of adderall that can be safely prescribed to a patient? And If I am already taking 40 mg...   - I don't know if the crying has to do with the ADHD, but it is so frustrating. My parents tell me to stop being a push-over and stop being so nice to people because people will take advantage of that. The thing is, I am afraid that If i start yelling or fighting back, the crying is going to start coming, so I don't bother fighting back because I do not want people to see me cry, it's so fucking embarrassing..Like I've cried over the most stupidest and it's not like I AM TRYING TO CRY..like it just happens! - I've cried when I do actually feel sad.. but I've noticed that I cry a lot when I am angry, stressed, or frustrated, or I can cry if I think about a bad memory, I've also cried for other people's misfortunes (not very often, it depends on the misfortune).   - I really don't know what to do. I feel like it's affecting my life, and my parent's don't understand, they just tell me I have to find a way to manage it... I really need help.

I can't decide if what I'm going through right now kicked off Saturday afternoon or if it was later than that, but I don't like it one bit. On that afternoon, I started doing a reinstall of Linux on my desktop computer since it needed some digital clutter cleaned out of it and it was easier to just do it that way than to try to reconfigure the system manually. While it was installing, I drafted a blog post and took a shower, but I had to stop that little project so I could go to a bi-monthly RPG group I'm in with a bunch of friends. That night was actually a kind of big night for my character, but I wound up getting irritable because I couldn't get a word in edgewise towards the end, so I clammed up instead of getting snippy with my friends. I mean, they've all seen me do that before and would have totally understood, but I still would rather just not do it to begin with. It sort of put a damper on things.  That night, I wound up staying up way too late (6 AM, but I am used to a night work schedule during the week) trying to get some of the finer points of configuring my computer settled. I couldn't remember how to do something I had done nearly a year prior (I'll spare all of the Linux geekery here), and wound up fighting with it for a while. It was one of those cases where I'd latched on and I just wasn't wanting to walk away from it. And I mean like three feet away.  I think I got up around noon on Sunday and immediately set to futzing around on the computer some more. I was pretty restless, though, and couldn't manage to stay in front of it for more than an hour at a time. With my wife trying to catch up on her schoolwork and my daughter recovering from a cold, I could have easily stayed in the bedroom all day poking at things until they finally worked, but eventually I figured out something that I hadn't done which I really needed to do: eaten. It was nearly 4 in the afternoon, and the most I'd had to eat was a small piece of leftover pizza. We wound up going grocery shopping, and of course I was grabbing all the things off of the shelf in a frustrated mixture of hangryness and impulsivity, but my wife was dealing with it calmly in the way that only a wife of ten years could. Long story short, the wife &amp; daughter wound up wanting to watch Titanic, and we didn't own Titanic, so I made a deal with my wife that she would stick the fish sticks in the oven while I headed out to rent it. So, I wound up not eating until like 6:30 PM. We watched Dr. Strange right after, and then I spent a little while catching up on shows from the week and making a few more tweaks on the computer, and was in bed by my normal time of 3:30 AM.  Today, I didn't want to get up. At all. Every time I even thought about it, I gave myself the "fifteen more minutes" excuse and laid down for another hour. At 2 PM, I finally dragged myself out of bed, got a shower, watched a video while fixing myself a sandwich and getting dressed, and then I headed out to return the movies and go to work.  I've had my bad days at work where I've felt like I couldn't concentrate. I think we all have. But today has been far beyond that. The first thing I learned when I got here is that they're going to be rearranging the desks where I sit tomorrow during first shift, and I was unreasonably angry about that. Then I had one spreadsheet problem in my email that I needed to deal with, and it was like I was reading something in a foreign language. No matter how many times I read it, I couldn't get my brain around what they were trying to say. It took me two hours to decipher this strange text, and then another hour to formulate a 500-word response, and the entire time the opening theme to 'Last Week Tonight' was playing on a loop inside my head. My brain, it's not braining.  So, quick background: I was diagnosed as a kid back in the 80's. I'm not medicated, and that's an entirely different ball of anxiety-wax. My only physical symptoms of illness have been a slight uptick with my allergies and my eyelids have been twitchy. The above is pretty much my entire weekend, and I don't know if I'll be able to handle it if I feel this way tomorrow.

I posted not too long ago about feeling incompetent in general in terms of college and such. I find myself buried in work and too embarrassed to tell my friends how behind I am, so I don't even have them to lean on for support.   I figured out that's what I really need, support! My school has three therapy groups with our health service center, specific to loss, anxiety, and DBT. I think that I'm going to talk to the director of our accessability resources office and ask about creating a study/support group for students with ADD/ADHD! I know it would be really helpful for me personally, as I do work much more easily when in the presence of others who are expecting me to work (for example, I was studying with some friends until around midnight when they decided to go to sleep... ever since I left their room I've been fucking around on Reddit...). It would also be really useful to connect with other people on campus with the same struggles and fears that I have!  I also just wanted to rant a bit about my personal struggle, since I don't have too many people/places to vent to. It has been a hellish week. I almost stooped to a scary low point today, but luckily a friend knocked on my door and we watched some silly YouTube videos and an episode of "Whose Line Is It Anyway," which always cheers me up.  Sometimes my inability to cope with the stress that my "incompetence" brings me is scary. I have extreme ups and extreme downs, but the ups are so beautiful and I just need to figure out how to prolong them! :)

How would you describe it &amp; what analogy would you use?;;;Title says it all (I hope). Also please note what subtype you've been diagnosed with. I'd be very interested in seeing the differences.  I'm ADHD-PI and here goes:  If it's something that interests me, it's relatively easy to focus but my mind still slips away. I'd compare it to walking on an icy road and losing your footing every few steps but managing to recover before the fall.  If I've been doing the same interesting activity for a while I start slowly losing interest. As a result, instead of recovering I start to daydream and go on autopilot. I'm aware of it happening but don't have the mental fortitude to force attention.  If it's a really mundane activity that requires attention it feels like I'm trying to push two magnets with the same poles together. The harder I try the more they push back and it ends up slipping away to the sides. I can never make them connect. The most I can manage here is autopilot. If I keep trying to focus, I'm too exhausted even for auto pilot after 15m or so.

I was diagnosed once as a kid, but my parents never told me about it and never put me on medication. After going on academic probation in college I made a big enough stink about it that they acquiesced to more testing, at which point I learned about the first round of exams done when I was 10. I'm pretty sure I undersold some of the symptoms I experience in my intake appointment-- I was still pretty sold on their narrative that I was "just a lazy and spacey kid"-- but I can't know what will happen before I go in and pick up the results. It's been two months of waiting and I'm so anxious about this!

Sometimes I feel like I will never find love despite that I am not looking for a relationship right now. I am falling behind in terms of schoolwork so I am working hard to catch up. I spend most of my time alone so I can count the number of friends I have on one hand.  I suck at small talk. It's not like I am rude but I think because of my past experiences, I've been conditioned to be oversensitive and sometimes distrustful of people.  Sometimes I feel like I will never find love. I have never dated before and I know nothing about the dating game.

I can't ever be interested in one thing for an extended period of time. One thing that makes me happy one day, the next it will quite literally put me to sleep. I'm not sure if this is due to obsessing and then consequently burning out, or if it's simply a temporary loss of interest (or more specifically, stimulation).  I'm always deeply interested in certain topics and I'll research the hell out of them, so I can understand the fundamentals of very specific topics. For instance, I'm very interested in Art, Science, and History. A subject that grabs all of these at once is photography, and the amount of information to be gathered in each of those categories is amazing! I'll find myself up until 5 in the morning figuring out the chemical process of photographic film. I find that very interesting. But the next day, it's gone. And if i try to think about it my brain gets sleepy.  What i'm getting at is, i'm afraid that this obsession with photography will eventually fade. And all of this knowledge gained will be in vain. I'm a horrible photographer, I don't think i've ever really taken a good image. But the science that goes into it fascinates the hell out of me. Now, at least. I know this will probably fade. As does all the obsessions i've had before hand. And I just don't know what i'm going to do. How can I find a career? How can I find and do something that I love? How have you all done this, and how long have you had the job you're working now? I know there are a lot of questions here. I guess i'm just venting.   tl;dr, I don't know what to do with my life because the things that interest me now probably won't in the future. How did you all find fulfilling careers?

So it looks like I might be going on meds at some point over the next year or so.  I'm interested in being as little affected by meds as possible, and really want as few effects as possible other than managing the ADHD symptoms.  I'm also going to see if there are medications I can take for work days only, rather than 100% of the time.  I want to know what kind of effects ADHD meds have on you other than managing symtpoms.  How do they make you feel on a day-to-day basis, do they have any physical feelings or body-load etc etc.  How do they affect your mood, your thoughts, and your physical feelings at the time?  How do the different medications affect you differently?  **TL;DR**:  I'm probably going to get a diagnosis soon and am wondering what I can expect from the meds, other than (hopefully) helping my ADHD symptoms

It used to be the case even before diagnosis and even now between meds.. And even during meds but to a lesser degree.  Its like an emptiness and it makes you want to smash your head against something, to feel something, anything than this gaping nothingness.  Its not even like the sheer hopelessness that comes from depression but utter emptiness.   It seems its called Anhedonia, an inability to derive pleasure from things.  Anyone else have it and know how to deal with it?

How in the seven hells do you get started in the morning?;;;Was diagnosed with inattentive type ADHD in Januay, and they just put me on Straterra a week ago. Can't say it's working because I still forgot to brush my teeth and empty he litter box this morning, but at least it no longer makes me feel like a zombie.  Going from an 11am to 7pm job to a job where I need to be up at 6:45am to be there at 8:30 is....well, a hot mess. And it isn't even adjusting to a new sleep schedule.  My boyfriend is an EMT and regularly gets up at 4 to be at work at 5:30am. His advice was to make ready EVERYTHING you need for the day before and stick it in a place where you know you'll see it. Problem is, my mind goes into hyper drive in the early morning. Things get done as I remember them and I often forget to brush my teeth or I leave lunch sitting on the counter.  I'll make a plan on the way home - undress, feed cat and rats, empty litter box, prepare dinner and lunch, shower, video games for a few hours, set out clothes for tomorrow, bed.   Now imagine all those steps reversing and stopping at feeding the pets, showering, remembering you still have chicken in the fridge, starting a match on Overwatch and forgetting you haven't had dinner. Oh, and you forgot to empty the litter box AGAIN.  How the hell do you manage all this before the meds kick in?

I'm especially interested to hear from people who have an official diagnosis and exhibit ALL of the following:  * Fall asleep within 15-20 minutes of laying down * Stay asleep (with the exception of getting up to use the bathroom) * Don't snore on any level (even a little) and don't experience restless leg issues * Under typical conditions, FEEL REFRESHED upon waking * Feel "awake" during the day with maybe a minor dip in the afternoon (which is pretty normal) * Have trouble with executive functioning, but don't feel "tired"/"sleepy"

(Huffington Post);;;Read [this](http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/9055288) article yesterday on a friends Facebook wall. It's not specifically geared toward ADHD, but I can still definitely relate on a rather uncomfortable level to the "man" in this scenario.    Me forgetting to do certain small things is an ongoing thorn in my relationship's proverbial side; and this article reminded me of an argument we had one time where my SO wanted me to do something (I can't even remember what it was now) and I blurted out "it's hard because it's just not important to me."   He took it as me saying that his feelings weren't important, whereas I meant that task itself wasn't high on my list of priorities in general and that made it more difficult for me to remember to do.   This article reinforced that moment and made it a little easier to understand from his end. I'd love to hear other peoples thoughts/experiences and any advice on breaking out of this rut in genera.

Basically in the last 5 years or so there has been a growing awareness of some attention deficits and just random, crazy weird things that either I have noticed or someone close to me has noticed.   The one that started it all was nearly ten years ago when my then girlfriend noticed I had neatly folded a shirt and put it under the toaster in the kitchen cupboard...  Fast forward a decade, we married, she squeezed out a kid, we are divorcing. A lot happened obviously, but it all ended up with me deciding to pursue diagnosis for adult ADHD. I have never been a good listener, and that has been the most damaging thing in my life to date. It has ruined relationships, caused stressors, etc. I know a lot of ya'll can relate.  I met with my primary physician, he told me I was clearly diagnosable but he wanted a psychiatrist MD to do it. I met with the shrink, got the diagnosis and was immediately prescribed Ritalin. A very low dose, 10mg q daily.  I just took my first dose, and while I feel like I am noticing some significant changes, it is too early to tell how much is psychosomatic and how much is legitimate. So my question to ya'll is...  How have meds helped or hindered? What kind of challenges have you faced with your ADHD and how did you handle them? Will the appropriate use of medication help with my listening skills and interactions in relationships? I'm tired of causing damage and losing friends. I'm naturally an extrovert and have been so lonely for the majority of my life. I wish I had pursued diagnosis earlier.  TL;DR Newly diagnosed ADHD when it should have happened 25 years ago, new to meds (low dose Ritalin), lonely AF cause my lack of listening skills ruin most relationships, help?

I knew it was coming, but part of the diagnosis included career recommendations.  I am a bit slow in math, and as such it was recommended that I should not pursue a career that requires advanced math.  This is a bit problematic, because I am in school for marine science, and this requires at least calc I to graduate.  I could possibly take a BA route that would only require precalculus to complete, but I'm worried it will limit my options.  So any scientists or engineers here who can relay their experiences in the field?  Should I seek other career fields? It doesn't seem like I would really need a whole lot of math to practice marine science, and I feel like with accomodations, I should be able to complete the advanced math courses no problem...but I am just starting out in my degree path, so I may be wrong about that.  Any one have any thoughts on pursuing a career that requires math, and their experiences in such a field? Thanks in advance.

He is not doing well at all, is pretty much nonfunctional without them. Is there anything I can do to help things along?  Should I contact his new doctor to tell him how nonfunctional my husband is without his meds?  A little context: this is all in Canada. My husband was diagnosed with ADHD many years ago, and has been taking Dexedrine on and off for the last few years.  He doesn't like it much because of some of the side-effects, and has often quit for a while, only to have lots of problems, including loosing jobs, disappointing family, letting me down, etc. However, Dexedrine was all that was available at the time he was diagnosed.   My husband's original GP died a couple of years ago, so he had to find a mother doctor.  He found a GP who wasn't that comfortable with treating ADHD, but was willing to give him the prescription he's been on for a decade with his deceased GP.   Earlier this year my husband learned of Vyvanse and wanted to try it.  However, when he brought it up with the GP, the guy abruptly told him he wouldn't prescribe his ADHD drugs anymore. All he would do is give him drugs for depression. My husband said this guy called him an addict. Yeah, my husband fired him, and found another doctor.  So the new GP agreed to take my husband on, but wasn't going to prescribe anything until he got my husband's records; this is an entirely rational decision, I wouldn't do it either without some corroborating evidence. The problem is it will take at least 6 weeks to get the records from the practice the dead GP was a part of.  All of the guy's patient records are in some warehouse somewhere and need to be located.  Needless to say, things have not been going well.  My husband has missed a whole lot of work, and is only still employed because his employer knows what's going on and appreciate just how well he works when he is properly medicated. He's been having lots of difficulties with interacting with his family and me.  I don't want to get into too many details, but I'll tell you both his parents and I are really struggling to be supportive while at the same time making sure stuff gets done.  Both his parents and I would like to do something to help get him back on his meds and functional again.  The question is, what can we do?  I've considered contacting his new GP and telling him what is going on, and no, not asking him anything about my husband's medical information, just filling him in on my in-laws and my concerns. I'm not sure if this would be a good thing to do.  I would really appreciate any suggestions on how we can help get my husband back on his meds.  I'm concerned that he may loose his job if this keeps going on, and I'm  not going to be able to support both of us on a single income. I can't continue shouldering most of the responsibilities  at home for much longer.  Thanks in advance for any advice.
6821caea15b3c166db56a209a89da297848102d421dde6bfe885d3657bd36ede;;;A fun story about the strangest episode of "hyperfocus" I have ever experienced, by far (just wanted to share). Also, do your memorization abilities change once you start taking medication, even when you aren't on it?;;;(Wall of text, my apologies)  Long story short, I went on a (kind of) date with this guy a couple days ago and experienced the most intense episode of hyperfocus I ever have. The only thing that makes this guy special or different from the other ones is that he is probably the most attractive person I have ever dated, exactly my type, and a solid 9.75 in my opinion. That and he's trouble; he's definitely *not* the type that I am supposed to be dating, which made the whole time even more thrilling, somehow.  Anyway, we went out for a long drive and stopped a few places and walked around along the way. We talked the whole time and had a lot of fun. The whole thing lasted a little over two hours, then he dropped me off back home.  I didn't decide to classify this as hyperfocus until later. On the date nothing seemed unusual, but a few hours later when my mom asked how it went and I started telling her about it, I realized that I could remember most of our entire two hour conversation. I can replay it in my head like a movie, in super vivid detail. I not only remember what everything looked like but a fair bit of the music we listened to, but what some cars looked like, little insignificant things that happened, the exact route we drove, people I saw walking along the street, and exactly what he was wearing. I remember at one point looking at his shirt and noticing that it still had creases along the sleeves like it was new. I did a little experiment this morning and wrote it down and counted, and in all I can remember about 200 specific lines of dialogue between us; more parts of the memory are coming back even now. And I out the dialogue this morning, two days AFTER the date, and not on medication.  I'm totally baffled by this. Something like this has never happened before, where I could remember a single long event so clearly and vividly. I wasn't on medication at the time; the last time I'd taken my dose of 10mg Adderall IR was like... over 24 hours ago, so this obviously was not due to the medication. My absorption of things like this really sucks on a normal basis, like I can't remember a single thing I've learned after sitting through a 50 minute lecture unless I'm taking Adderall.   I've noticed a few more instances like this (not to this extent obviously) happening recently, where I remember the dumbest little things in really vivid detail. Off the medication though, not on it. Is there a reason this is happening? Do medications somehow permanently improve your memory, even when you aren't on them? Has anyone else had similar experiences?  Thanks if you read through this whole thing. Definitely did not intend for it to turn out this long.  **TL;DR:** Went out on a very thrilling date with a very thrilling guy and realized afterwards, even two days later, that I could vividly remember almost the entire 2 hour conversation from start to finish (written out and counted, almost 200 specific lines of dialogue), including all these random little insignificant events and details that happened along the way. That was all without meds. That's the fun story. My question is, does taking medication (I'm on Adderall IR 10mg once a day) permanently affect memory, even when you aren't on it? Anyone else had a similar experience? I usually suck at remembering things but I've noticed a few more instances like this happening recently when I'm not on meds.

Of course, I plan to visit a neurologist as I do not necessarily trust self-diagnosis.  But it got me thinking, how at 17 years old I still cannot manage to brush my teeth on a regular schedule (I forget).  Or take showers every day.  I also cannot remember for the life of me to put deodorant on.  I forget to cut my fingernails for months on end, and I am a guy.  I am just guessing here but who knows, I am really just looking for some consolidation.  I mean I would go to the dentist and they would say for years, "You know how much this costs?" and "Gum disease will be inevitable and is linked to many other types of diseases, and increases the risk of a heart attack," and as much as it frightened me nothing changed.  Hell every time I was in that dentist's chair I would say to myself I would figure it out.  And I never did.  I simply could not remember, even if I used methods of reminding myself.  As soon as I saw the reminder on my phone, the thought would be out to the void again.       It really leads me to wonder if something neurological is going on with this.  Have any of you who have been diagnosed experienced these issues, or have children who have?

I left my doctor's office today with what I understood to be a 90-day prescription for my medication. She handed me three separate pages with concurrent dates, and said that I needed to give them all to my pharmacist in order to receive the 90-day price.   My wife and I have a strict budget, and it's important to make sure that my medication fits in that budget. Simple request, I would imagine.  When I head to the same pharmacy that filled my last prescription, I'm told that it will be $300, which is ***not*** what I discussed or researched with my doctor.   Lo and behold, she wasn't using my pharmacy insurance (which I handed her) to find the price and instead was giving me something else.  She tells me that they cannot hold each prescription and they cannot fill the 90-day version on this series of scrips and that my doctor needs to re-write it. She tells me the (now corrected) price of the 90-day and the 30-day versions and asks if I want her to fill the 30-day.  Doc says she can't write it like that, and to just use one at a time. Fine, whatever. This price still works, just not as planned. We can shift things around.  When I return to this pharmacy, I deal with another tech to whom I hand one month's worth and my prescription insurance card. She sets the card down without looking at it and walks over to another tech saying "Do we have this? Do we have this adderall?" rather loudly.  After receiving confirmation, she comes back and says    "We'll have it done in an hour."     So I reply:    "Yeah, I have work soon, so I'll come by after I get off, since you'll still be open."    Which prompts:     "It'll be *ready* in an **hour**."    So I repeated myself and thanked her, then asked to confirm the price I spoke about earlier, since apparently my insurance card didn't remain on file, and I get:  "She told you the price earlier."  "Right but there was a mistake earlier, I just want to make sure we get it right so I can afford -"  "The price will be $XX.XX."  I thanked her and as I walked away I could hear her talking under her breath, but I couldn't make it out and I needed to be at work. Been steaming all day thinking about it. Next month I'm finding a different pharmacy.  ---------------------   #TL;DR: I love dealing with bitchy people while trying to get my medicine.
367ca148dfffc3e0fde89f05b50b8a8aa81609e029a8ac33bc30ce08f291d38b;;;No idea what to do. All sorts of confused.;;;So the last two days I have been to see my Psychiatrist and my Psychologist. At my last visit with the Psychiatrist, he put me on Adderall XR, "Because it has more oomf." This was coming off of my 40MG Ritalin LA that I said I didn't feel like was working. He gave me a 30 pill supply of 5mg and said to titrate it. So I did... 5mg for a week, then moved on to 10, then to 15, and finally 20 (before I ran out), but when I went to see him, he said that I should have titrated faster than that e.g. 5mg, 10, 15, 20, etc each day, which totally contradicts what I did when I started on the Ritalin, and it contradicts what is in the titration schedule (which says 7 days). Meanwhile, I had only started the 20mg on the day I went and saw him (stupid pre-auths), and he said, well, if you don't feel like the 15mg was working for you, then maybe we need to switch you to Vyvanse. I am like... ok... I haven't even been on this a month yet... So he prescribes another set of 5mg to continue the titration, but of course it is delayed because the system thinks I should have 11 more pills left....   This same doctor said that maybe my depression is caused by lack of motivation and if the Adderall works then I could go off the Zoloft... smh  Then today I visited my Psychologist for our weekly appointment, I told him everything that happened yesterday, and he said... "Well, I am starting to think you don't really have ADHD. Because the only thing that you have said that might point to it, is trouble reading." He said, "Well, you have a high intelligence, so maybe your boredom is caused by a lack of stimulation since you are bored with the topic and could be learning or doing something new. It is like.. wtf... I was tested using some dumb ass test that said I was ADHD-PI, and he was like, yea, but I don't like those tests, they can't really tell you anything. (Mind you I have been seeing him for the last 6 months or so.)  I said what about the medication... he said that the medication is going to work no matter who takes it. (Thus kids abusing Adderall in college.) He also said, you know, you are a bigger guy, so maybe your dose wasn't high enough yet (Which is contrary to what I see in the FAQ...).   TL;DR: So I am all sorts of confused. I thought I was doing thing right in regards to my medication and talk therapy, but now both are contradicting what I have heard and read. I am not a doctor by any means, but if anyone has any *recent* scholarly articles on the topics, I would be happy to read them so I can discuss them next week.   P.S. Sorry about the wall of text...

This should be my last year in college as an engineering major, however, due to my inadequate study habits, I'm about the equivalent to beginning my junior year. I have always loved designing and 3d printers and taking things apart so I know this is what I want to do but having to retake so many classes has me questioning if I'll ever graduate before I run out of student loan opportunities. I feel that even if I do graduate, will I even be able to hold down a job because of my forgetfulness and lack of attention?      On the other hand, my friends, family, and significant other just don't get it. They all think I'm just lazy and unmotivated and say that I use ADD as a cop-out for being irresponsible. I tell then that , no, waking up at 11 and not being able to think until 1 is not something I do because I don't care, it's a curse when you have to fit into a society like this. Sometimes I wish that I was like that because I wouldn't feel like such a fuck up when I failed at simple things (like remembering to close the garage door) yet alone advanced math and science. My mother and father have been supportive in the sense that they allowed me to get diagnosed 7 years ago but they believe I'm in it for the drugs (adderall IR 20mg 3 times a day). All of this stuff occurs even though I'm medicated. If I go without meds it's like I'm in the clouds all day and I'll even stop speaking mid-sentence because I get distracted so bad. I question whether there is a place in the world that someone like me can live and be happy. I don't know what to do with myself anymore and I can't see life getting any better when I have more responsibility. Sorry for the long post if you made it this far.

(Possible ADHD) (Mainly education based);;;(I am now 16 years old)  My whole life I've never understood why I couldn't keep concentration writing for more then 15 or so words before I start thinking about something irrelevant. Or I couldn't get through 2 math questions before noticing the patterns in the carpet of the floor room and following them up and down for minutes. Or why I was always getting distracting by background noises and my own fidgeting.  In the past (prep-grade 6), they had never affected my A+ marks in Math/Sciences, as learning those topics was rather outlined and structured. But the gap to English/History based subjects was DRAMATIC (D). In fact the only reason I passed English and history was because I was a good speller, and was known for keeping a structured format.   High school came, and it got much worse. In a classroom situation, I knew the work better than most kids, but they'd always get double as much work done as me just because I couldn't get it done. Therefore, because I wasn't working on it I wasn't improving as the other kids were and my grades began to even out. D for English based, C for Math based.  Here we are, 11th grade. Beginning my final courses for high school, and I'm failing. In the classroom I'm struggling to take in everything the teacher says because I'm looking at other stuff around me, and when it's work time I work very slow because I struggle to concentrate on just that single task ahead of me. I'll often have 3-4 different projects going in class working on them all at once.   I am seeing a neurologist for Migraines, which have caused me to miss a lot of school time not helping with my concentration issue.  NO ONE has ever picked up on it besides myself, and I've only begun to open up about it in the last few weeks. I have been looking into ADHD and finding myself in similar situations as many others, but haven't been diagnosed.  I told him about my concentration issues, and he said to see the school psychologist first which is what I am doing next week.  I'm forgetting lots of small things, primarily things people tell me. Maybe because I just don't listen? Last night we were leaving home, I walked past the light and my dad told me to turn the light off, I said "no worries" locked the door, and walked to the car. Forgetting within seconds, to turn the lights off. I forget to turn power points off, to close doors behind me, etc etc  I have a question, can you guys manage to sit down and play video games? or watch a movie, TV show?  This is the one thing I LOVE to do, because it keeps my mind active and I don't get distracted.   I've been trying to tell my parents all this but they are telling me I'm overreacting blah blah blah. They say "I was like that when I was younger" half the time and the other half will be "yeah, we all have these things you just gotta push through it".... At the moment, they are questioning if I'm telling the whole truth about all this, as they are confused as to why I can concentrate and manage to play video games for hours but cannot study for 15 minutes. I tell them I really can't explain, and that makes them confused. I need help explaining why I can look at screens and concentrate on sport, but struggle to concentrate when reading, constructing paragraphs etc.  I am able to do it, it just takes me a very very long time. This text here took an hour for me to write, which is surprisingly short. I can never reach word limits on school essays and articles just because I don't have the time, because I waste time being distracted and trying to zone in.  Please give me any feedback or answer any of my questions and I will be so thankful, thanks so much for reading.

Sorry,Preface here, 25 yo M physically fit active duty marine.   I've always known I needed to be medicated for ADHD it's always been quite apparent. But recently, my work results, mood, all around effectiveness as a human being has just felt to be deteriorating. I only refused medication as a younger man because I had heard it would keep you from being allowed to enlist in the armed forces.   Fast forward   I caved. I needed to do something, I just wanted to be able to perform like I thought I should be able to. Reading your guys success stories really made me take this leap, I was ready to try anything.   This week I was finally diagnosed and today I took my first pill. 20mg of adderall XR. I took it around 1430 excited to start my prescription.   I don't think I had any major changes today I suspect maybe a little placebo was taking place. but I did feel a little bit more focused to be honest.   Work is over and I'm driving home. I'm about 5 minutes into my drive when it happens. Hands down, the worst panic attack of my life. I thought I was going die in that car. First the adrenaline came, then my heart began to pound and my chest got tight. I couldn't catch my breath and the terror and panic defeated me. I flagged down a car because I planned on them calling 911 in the event I lost consciousness. I parked and tried to gather myself because.. fuck I don't know isn't that what your supposed to do?  Calm down?   I never ended requesting emergency services. After about 1 minute parked it came down. The adrenaline was fading, my breath was coming back and chest loosening.   I do have a history of anxiety. I've had some smaller attacks in the past and this week at work was pretty tough. But I've never experienced anything close to that.   I will talk to doc in the morning about this to see if I should continue this dose/type and talk about options.   But I guess my questions for the community are:  has anyone else experienced this or heard of similar incidents?   should I take my morning dose?   Thank you in advance and sorry for the poor grammar.

I went for a dev job as this was where my interest lied but I ended up in a testing job. I hated every minute of it, but stuck out the full year for the grade. It wasn't just the testing that I hated, but office work, 9-5. I went back to university for my final year with regret that I made the wrong choices but I did what I do best and coasted along through the final year to graduation falling asleep in every lecture and cramming before every test and came out with a good grade.  However, at this point I still hated the fact I was going to be desk bound until I retired but did what I knew best, I bottled it down and got a software dev job. This was better, but I still hated the 9-5 daily grind of a desk job; within 4-6 months I was completely fed up and used to go home in a blind rage screaming in my car at how much I hated it. However I did what I knew best, I bottled it up and carried on. Occasionally the odd perk came along which helped alleviate the pain and eventually I got to work from home every day!   I stayed at that job (my first job out of university) for 6 years because I didn't know what I wanted to do instead and I'd argue with myself that 'it wasn't a bad job, other people would like it, what's wrong with me!?'. So again, I did what I do best, I shut down and coasted along. Except this time it became too much and I had to go and see someone because my rage was becoming unmanageable, I hated myself for it; I got this more under control again and carried on coasting until I was made redundant - the day those words came out of HR's mouth I was overwhelmed with joy (but I kept it low key, in my head and pretended to act as if I cared slightly), to the point that I was complimented at just how well I dealt with the situation.  Still, at this point I didn't know what I wanted to do instead but at this time I had spent so much time analysing everything that I started to notice that my difficulties were a lot like someone with ADHD, and I had many symptoms (present since childhood) that I saw a GP who referred me. In the meantime, I needed to get myself a new job. I have bills to pay, people depending on me, a pet to take care of. To do all that I needed a job, and a good one - So I bottled up my other career ideas and ambitions and got a new job as a software dev. Shortly into this I got officially diagnosed as ADHD combined type of a mild severity.  So, here I am today - 6 months into my job - the honeymoon period has worn off and I'm bored... but I'm doing what I do best, bottling it up and pushing on... even though I hate ever working minute of my working life - eventually I know I'm going to break but I don't know what else to do.  **To conclude**  ... I think I need a career change, I've thought that for 8 years but here's the thing...  * I know that, technically speaking, I have a good job * I have so many ideas of what I could do instead but I fear I'll be bored of them in 6 months * I have so many ideas of what I could do I don't know which to persue in case I pick the wrong one * Any career change I make will be a step backwards with less pay and financially I'll struggle * After a career change, I'd probably end up realising I should have just stuck it out as a software dev - after all, I'm so far in now  So I don't know where to go from here other than doing what I know best. Bottling it down, sucking it up, pushing on through, not going above and beyond and raising everyones expectations but doing enough to not raise any eyebrows...  Until, of course, I break!**

I need to exercise. No ifs, ands, or buts... of which many will follow. And not just "little walks here and there" - I got that part down! But I need to *really* exercise. It just always seems like such a herculean task to get started.    For example, I love swimming. A couple summers ago, I was able to swim in my apartment's pool during the summer. I lost weight like crazy and got in good shape. But it was difficult to find a time when the tiny pool was unoccupied enough that I could swim laps, and it's only open June through September. So I resolved that for the winter I would join a gym that had a pool.    2 years ago.   Why? I know all of these are just excuses, but I seriously can't get over these hurdles to make myself do it.    * When to go to the gym? Lunch break would be super busy (mild social anxiety too, whoopee), and if I showered or swam, it would mess up my hair and makeup and I wouldn't be presentable for work. Straight after work is difficult because I usually have a very small lunch and get light headed exercising. After dinner could work, but the gym would have to be open (Who closes at 7:30 wtf) and it would be very difficult to motivate myself to go somewhere after a long day. Early morning makes the most sense. ...If I could ever get myself out of bed in time.    * Find a gym with a pool. There are a few in my town! One has a great facility but is a long drive, which means losing nearly ~45 additional min of my evening that already feels too short. There's one that's close to home and work but in a bad part of town and the equipment is questionable. Another in the same area, better equipment but crappy hours. And one fancy gym that only has an outdoor pool. I can't decide.    * "Just go try one out!" see: Social anxiety, plus gym prices are CRAZY. The Ys here is $15 for a one day pass and God knows what the fancy gyms are. Also the Ys require cash for a day pass and I never have cash, so that's a trip to the bank. And then I'm really hesitant to sign up for a membership for $50 a month knowing how difficult it is to get my butt down there regularly.    2 years and apart from that research, all I have to show for it is a gym bag and a lock for my hypothetical locker. So... maybe I just need to choose something that's less effort to do.    I did yoga for a while and loved it, but I really need more cardio. Can't stand jogging after having a gym teacher that wouldn't let us stop for *anything* while we were running for 20 minute straight, even though I have asthma. I don't like walking alone because I tend to daydream and it gets me in trouble. Treadmill/Bike in front of the TV? Sounds so great in theory. I can't do it. I can't hear the TV over the treadmill, or can't pay enough attention to the plot while focusing on pedaling, so 15 min in I get so fed up that I stop so I can just watch my show in peace.    I just feel stuck in a rut. Exercises that are easy to do are too boring to stick with and the ones I enjoy are too much work for me to ever get started with. And of course the typical advice of "you just gotta do it," is my biggest problem as someone with ADHD.    tl;dr: How do I make myself exercise regularly when everything is either too boring or too hard to start?

I was diagnosed with ADD when I was 8. I have been making it through life, but relationships suffered. i am a single father and man added on top of everything else. I decided enough was enough and went to see a doctor. i was diagnosed with ADHD. He prescribed me adderall, but I can not afford name brand. I took the generic, but could not sleep last night at all? Then today I was a jittery, but I refused to miss my workout. So no sleep. This is my second day and honestly I am thinking about cutting each pill in half and only taking two instead of three. Now I may not get the high feeling but that is not what I want. I just want to focus, be more attentive to my family, socialize, and sleep? Any advice would be well taken.

I have 2 jobs because my boyfriend and I are trying to get our own apartment, we currently live with roommates. I have worked at my main job for almost two years, and my second part time job for 3 months.  My main job is a clerk at a thrift store, and my second job is a delivery driver at a gas station/pizza/chicken place. Because of my ADD I have forgotten part of orders at the store and had to return and make second trips, I have forgot to cut pizzas among other “silly” mistakes that have made me feel/look stupid.   Last Monday everyone at the pizza/gas station was informed that they had suspended deliveries, 4 people have been let go, and I was not one of them. I was kept on even though I was the last one hired (first one that should be fired right?) and even though I have made all those mistakes. I believe that I was kept because I am always willing to cover other people’s shifts, and come in when it’s busy. I have fixed a lot of the mistakes I used to make, and been good for 2-3 weeks before we stopped deliveries, and when we are not busy I am constantly cleaning something, or refilling something.   The manager that was responsible for deciding these things is the type that thinks people shouldn’t be talking when they could be working. Even though I believe that people should have fun at work, be able to joke with co-workers and customers, as long as everything that needs to be done gets done, but he thinks otherwise. He thinks everyone should be work focused.  I have anxiety because I am so self conscious about being seen as stupid, that I have a very hard time talking with people, so I try to focus on what I am supposed to be doing, and talking when spoken too, and trying to speak because I don’t want people to think I don’t like them, or am snobbish/standoffish. So because I am trying to fix all my mistakes, and am constantly working he decided to keep me on.  Others don’t see it this way.  I have over heard conversations, some I’m sure I was meant to overhear, about I should not be there. One even very loudly mentioned my learning disorder. When I first started working there, one of the managers asked if something was going on with me, so I mentioned my ADD and inability to get meds for it. She acted all concerned, and said that her son has the same thing, and she’s been trying to help him, and she will try to come up with a system that works for me.  Which turned into her writing me up for every infraction, including things others do but don’t get in trouble for, trying to build a case to get me fired. The other manager was promoted and she got transferred to the other side of the store (chicken side.)   Another manager (there are 3 assistant managers and then the manager that decided to keep me on, and not let me go) Asked me to put labels on lids, and went on the other side of a wall, and had a loud conversation with a women from chicken side about how I have a learning disorder, and she’s not trying to be mean blah blah blah. I have anxiety, and am kind of sensitive anyway, so I just hurried through the closing duties and got in my car and cried on the way home. I don’t think it’s fair that I am being treated like I shouldn’t be there because of something I can not control. I don’t think it’s fair that one of the managers was punishing me because of something I can not control, and she should understand better because of her son, and she should not have shared my ADD with the others.  I am a hard worker, it takes me a little longer to get things but I do get them and I AM NOT STUPID. I have not made a mistake in WEEKS but does anyone notice that? No. All they want to focus on is my learning disorder and the mistakes I have made. I am constantly cleaning and refilling things, while they text on their phones, or talk to each other about how unfair people being let go was, and how there is nothing to do (which if this was true, then how come I could find stuff to do?)  I have a good work ethic, and work hard. I am willing to help others by switching shifts or covering for them, I am forcing myself to do things I am bad at until I get better at it so I can help better. I keep things refilled and cleaned, and can always be found working. That is why I kept my job. I understand the frustration at their friends being let go, but hating on me when none of that was my decision, and hating on me/punishing me for something I can not control is unfair.  I hate being this way, I hate ADD, I hate not being able to medicate it, and I hate that others are unable to understand or be patient.  TL;DR: I have ADD and have made silly mistakes while starting my second job, four people have been let go, not me and people think because I have a learning disorder that I should have been let go instead of the others. I HATE ADD.

And every year I get told the same thing: my technical skills and expertise exceed everyone's, but my "soft skills" and "professionalism" are lacking, to say the least. At the beginning of my career it was fine, or at least not really detrimental, because the quality of my work was unmatched and I only needed to interact with my peers and colleagues, who know me and like me and my personality. But now I've finally gotten to the point where I can't get promoted any higher until I get my act together, because the next roles up include managing people and interfacing with big customers. I've been told that even though I'm a technical expert, that means nothing if people don't *see* me as a technical expert because of the way I speak and behave and interact with others in meetings.  My biggest "issues" when it comes to work is that I don't really have a work and home personality, I have one "take it or leave it" personality. Even medicated, my emotions can still get the best of me and I get get pretty "passionate" about my ideas and opinions on work-related things and I have no filter to stop myself from voicing them out loud. The worst is if I sense that someone is running their mouth but has no idea what they're talking about, I tend to correct them on the spot and it comes off as disrespectful, but again, my mouth says what I'm thinking before I can stop it. And even if my mouth doesn't say it, my face betrays me and will say exactly what I'm feeling and thinking. I tend to talk to everyone as if they're my bff, and although this works with most of my coworkers, this isn't appropriate if I ever start managing people or interfacing with customers.  I've been trying harder to stay cognizant of my actions and expressions and word choices the last few days, but inevitably I forget to stay aware of it and slip right back into my old habits and natural ways.  Typing this all out and seeing it in words makes me sound like a terrible person who I wouldn't like to work with, which makes me kind of sad, but I promise I'm a nice person. Just impulsive and filterless. I'm sure I'm in good company here.  Any other adults here in a career have tips or advice on how you achieve these "soft skills"? Fake it til you make it only works if you remember to fake it, and I'm bad at being fake.  TLDR; I need to learn how to be more professional if I want any chance of advancing in my career in the future.

My last relationship was 4 years long. We were actually engaged the last year and a half. I never told him. I wish I had! I think he would have understood me better, and possibly been more patient with me. I'm now dating someone. We are exclusive, but only about 3 months in. Since we have been clear with each other that we are both ready to settle down and get married, I feel like he should know. But when? And how? He's incredibly successful, wealthy, and totally organized. This man has his shit together. I appear to have mine together on the surface. But my finances are a disaster since I can't seem to keep track of anything... Anyway, back to the topic.   TL:DR we really like each other and there's future potential, but I'm afraid to tell him about my ADHD and I don't know how to do it.

As long as i've taken concerta, I've always noticed that it has reduced my apetite, overall making me not eat as much as i would when off the medicine.  My issue used to be that it would be hard for me to feel the need to eat. As I've grown older, i slowly made my way to eating regular sized meals while I'm medicated, which brings me to my current problem.  Whenever I either don't take my medicine or It's effects wear off, I have an unending feeling of hunger.  Eating a regular sized meal won't satisfy my stomach.  In addition to this, even when I feel the pressure on my abdomen caused by the ridiculous amount I've eaten, i still feel the need to eat more. Just curious if anyone else has gone through what I have

They stopped refilling my prescriptions. We'd have to schedule appts more than 6 months in advance and when we did get an appointment, the wait time was over 3 hours so finding a convenient time was nearly impossible. He was the only doctor to work with adhd patients in my little town. I have since moved (it'll be 2 years at the end of the month) and about a year ago, I tried making an appointment. I am a junior in college and classes and finals are getting more and more difficult and it's really hard to do without my meds. 2 years without my meds. I tried transferring to another doctor where I'm currently at (SATX) but my old doc won't release my records to and all of the doctors I called don't treat ADHD patients. What do I do? If you live in SATX, are there any docs you'd recommend? I need my meds. I need a doctor. help!  Thank you in advance

I called the doctors office so I can get my vyvanse recipe (was delaying to go for it for a week) . The thing is that today is friday and Ive got work to do today and a party tomorrow. I woke up like shit but I knew that if I didnt go I would fuck up my work and be a wreck at the party. I had to be there before 5pm or the only way was to get it on monday and that was not an option. So I just pushed through and got it (funny how in the end it is so easy). My point here is that we gotta do stuff like this even if it seems the worst sometimes. As a person with adhd I know the struggle to see how a decision can affect the future but just go do it for yourself because you know you deserve it

Have you seen it negatively affect your experience?;;;Hi everyone, I'm 32, male and been in 3 relationships before this encounter.  So a couple of weeks ago, I had a great first date with this wonderful lady. The date went smoothly, 5 hours, great times, yadda yadda.  The 2nd date, I was working during the day and I take my medication that lasts the entire day. I started to obsess on what to do and how to make myself awesome but I just came across as... meek and uninteresting. It was still a 4 hour date and things were still feeling like they were headed in the right direction.  Yesterday, she was saying she just had some major allergy problems and had to recent some urgent care from a local hospital. I decided that I wanted to give her a pick me up, get her a smoothie or something to cheer her up. It got later in the day and it was another day where I take my medication. Instead of getting a smoothie, she just suggested to get dinner together. So we went out, I came off as uninteresting and just didn't really feel like myself again. Was obsessing again about what to do.  So this morning, she texted me that she wasn't feeling it romantically and cancelled our actual planned 3rd date tonight. I've been pretty devastated and I'm trying to piece together answers on what I was doing. I've come with a conclusion that I had 0 expectations, didn't have my medication on the first date, while for date 2 and "3." I did come across as someone that I'm normally not while dating. I never was comfortable and my mind was just super/hyper focused on how I was doing instead of just relaxing and going with the flow.  It's never come up before with other dating or relationships because I'm normally doing dating on days where I don't take my medication...   TL;DR **Date 1 went well without meds, Date 2 &amp; "3" didn't go as well while I was on medication... and I was moved on from.**

I don't know which part of that is having the most effect here, but last week a friend of mine passed away. I don't know how to be.

Lately it feels like one bad thing after another and I feel I'm reaching the breaking point.   Does anyone else have this much difficulty when it comes to grief? if so how do you do it?

What is in store for me in the over the coming weeks/months/years?;;;I haven't really noticed any differences yet, but I haven't tried doing any school work/ reading yet either, so i'm not sure I would notice right away anyway.  My prescription was only 10 MG because my doctor wanted to start me off slow, she told me to come back in a month to discuss how it effects me and then we can talk about an increase of dosage.  All of my life I have had major attention deficit issues, and I am so happy to finally be doing something about it. I'm sure a lot of you know how I felt before, having major issues retaining information from conversations/readings, having an incredibly short attention span, and not being able to pay attention to anything for more then a few minutes.  When will I notice any changes? How will I know if I need an increased dosage? Should I not take adderall during the weekends?   I just turned 18, if that changes anything.
04e9c7d4b235a923e411900ccb4b9c9ead085c7881c8aaed323ac4286b897537;;;Got prescribed 30mg Elvanse today, got some questions.;;;I got prescribed 30mg Elvanse late last month and recently got it from the local pharmacy. This morning around 07:00 I consumed a 30mg capsule completely whole as it said in the instructions after having a nice breakfast. Didn't really feel anything at first but gradually over the course or 3-4 hours I started feeling things. First of all, I remembered better and didn't have to constantly fight myself to do things that aren't fun. Brushing my teeth, taking out the trash, cleaning the house etc. weren't the annoying chores they used to be anymore. I also used to hyperfocus all the time before, especially when playing video games or watching movies. Now? Not so much. I still hyperfocus but to a much smaller degree. I also found that my mood improved a lot and people even said that I seemed more approachable. Also I got this constant feeling of being awake or on alert.  However, that's where the positives end. First of all, I have vasoconstriction in my testicles/ballsack. Apparently this is a common thing with this type of medicine, but I wasn't prepared for it. It's like being in a really cold place but only for your ballsack. Super weird and kind of uncomfortable due to how small it gets. Second of all, my pupils became so freaking huge. Especially in darker rooms, it's like staring at a completely black void. I have green eyes, but you could barely see a green outline in a dark room because the pupils had dilated so much. That's kind of freaky and I'm scared of what other people might think. Third, I had some mild dry mouth and loss of appetite but nothing too insane. I used to get Ritalin as a kid and that stuff really messed me up and made me thin as hell. Lastly, I'm typing this right now from Norway at 01:12 at the time of checking it and I still feel awak or on alert. According to my doctor and the drug it should only last 14 hours but it's been well past that.  Should I be worrying right now?   Edit: For what it's worth I was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 8 and Aspergers at the age of 12. I'm now 22 years old.
c0ab32da7416dbb566ba018b02c768389f9767b770fc03e9fcac0e412a9b3a75;;;Adderall and Effexor;;;I was recently placed on Effexor (venlafaxine). This is the first time I've been on an antidepressant. I thought I needed it because I've struggled with depression my whole life; I am anhedonic, and recently if I'm off of work, I don't even eat or brush my teeth until noon, and i just can't do laundry for the life of me. So if Effexor decreases serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, while the adderall releases norepinephrine from the nerve endings, do they somehow counteract each other? The reason I'm asking is because I've noticed I simply don't care any more when I'm at work, and it used to be the only thing still motivating me. I am just suddenly ok with being average at my job and I've been flaking, which is super unlike me. I don't like it and I think I probably have to ask for Wellbutrin which I heard was more of an upper and worked better with Adderall. Any input will be greatly appreciated!

Doc doesn't believe me.;;;Recently diagnosed (Monday) and prescribed 5mg of Dextroamphetamine IR. First dose, made me calm and relaxed/sleepy. The next few days I took 10 mg. If i was lucky enough to not get the sleepy feeling i would be "in the zone" and able to start/complete mundane daily tasks. For only 2 hours. After that (or sometimes I dont get the zone but this happens still) I get extremely tired and fatigued. If i get the effects Im happy, and feel motivated. and then its like night and day within an hour later I could be extremely sad and think that i cant do anything again. And then i just feel like garbage until my allocated bed time (trying to practice sleep hygiene due to insane insomnia, prior to taking stimulants) However, I have noticed my ability to remember that bed time. And for the past couple days had the ability to follow a "plan".   I understand the rules of this subreddit. and I did ask my doctor about it yesterday. He just gave me a funny look and moved on with his questioning.   Also, when I felt tired after taking 2 doses, i tried taking a third (total 15 mg in one day - about 4ish hours after the first 10). And this didnt do anything. No change)   Am I doing something wrong here? also, i should point out, ive been finding it extremely difficult to remember to eat..

In this time, I gained 30lbs, my anxiety cane back and I have been dealing with all the other symptoms that come with being ADHD. I was only managing. So I went i to the dr yesterday for a prescription. Today I was debating filling it. Everyone was out of stock and I finally found a walgreens 20miles away that had some. I still wasn't sure if this was the right choice. I wanted to be "normal" and not depend on a drug. As im waiting for it to be filled I went to go pick up my daughter and run errands. This is when I notice my debt. Card has gone missing. Im frantic as I know for a fact I just had it. So im assuming it fell out somewhere. I cancel the card and go to my nearest bank for a replacement after an hour of searching the car. Im walking back to my car and i scratch my leg through my stretchy running capris. Thats when I feel it. Somehow, while driving all around town, I slid my card into the leg of my capris. I literally had the card on me the entire time. Who in the hell does that? This was my confirmation that I need the meds. Im tired of feeling like a hot, jumbled mess. Im ready to feel like a person again.  This whole thing was a hard realization that if I don't take control and accept help, I will do these things forever.

I'm a 20 year old college student who was just diagnosed with unspecified ADHD along with a learning disability. When talking to my psychiatrist about what "unspecified ADHD" means I'm still left with some confusion. Does this mean that there is a chance I don't have ADHD? I've never heard this term before so I just want to make sure I'm clear. I have always been worried that all of my issues happen to me because I'm lazy (which is what everyone has always told me). Now having someone tell me my issues are not my fault is extremely relieving, but I still have that nagging voice in the back of my head saying it's not real. I think once I can fully understand this unspecified portion I can truly accept this, start getting treatment, and stop subconsciously blaming myself for my downfalls.   Sorry if I'm a little ramble-y I'm new to reddit!   I mainly want to know, does an unspecified diagnosis carry the same weight/legitimacy to a specified one?

Please don't roast me :D   I've known I have ADHD (inattention) for awhile. My mother has it and when she was diagnosed, she told me all the time I definitely have it, too. I never believed her until I started doing research and went on a path of self-discovery. Once it hit me that I definitely have it, I became very motivated to get a diagnosis and medication. I'm a single parent working full time and I am barely holding on to sanity.   It took roughly 7 months with Kaiser to get my diagnosis and meds. It was a nightmare, but I won the battle...so I thought. I've been on Adderall IR for almost two weeks now. I started at 10mg twice daily and after my complaints that it was shockingly ineffective, my psych gave me the option to try 20mg twice a day or switch to something in the Ritalin family. I chose to try the 20mg option.   My impression: WTF. Adderall makes me lethargic and my attention and focus, as far as I can tell, have not improved. I'm just as sucked into my phone, I don't do anything productive. I know it's not a magic pill but I was hoping for SOMETHING. It's suppressed my appetite, but I don't think I've lost any weight, which is a bummer but whatever. I get cold now, when I was always hot before. My heart beats faster. My bowels are messed up even with taking a daily probiotic. My period is a week late. My mood is maybe even worse than before. I'm not necessarily irritable, just kind of flat. Time goes by so slowly.   I know meds work differently for everybody but I was hoping for so much more, after seeing my mom transform into a different person on Adderall. She was upbeat and perky and got shit done.   I just want to nap or stare at my phone/computer. I just want to be better. At work and home both.   Does anyone have any input? Is this normal for just getting on meds? Won't other types of stimulants be the same? Is there really a lot of difference? I mean I don't hate the Adderall but so much is lacking. Any advice at all, whether medication wise, words of wisdom, etc is greatly appreciated.

Well, I'm finally going to do it. I miss the energy I had when I was training and I'm not going to let myself be convinced by my excuses any longer.   Tomorrow, I'm going to get my ass out of bed (boyfriend has agreed to kick me out if I ignore my alarm) and hit the pavement.   I'll update you guys in a week or so. Please wish me luck...I'm going to need it.
1f8cc92dfcc0d6ded0db0f46d8ee1b7fa1d5a7cba76192836905e3ae322e40e5;;;Guys i'm in some deep shit, adhd seems to be getting worse and my treatment options are running thin. Also severe dependence.;;;Pre diagnosis i always thought i was dumb, i had a 1.8 GPA pre diagnosis that gradually rose to a 4.3 after being put on medication(concerta--&gt;adderall).   Then senior year they stopped working like they used to, gave me bad anxiety and my studies were tanking. I'd pull all nighters at least once a week because i'd procrastinate on every single test.   Got put on vyvanse and that smoothed things out a *little* then it became intolerable so i had Intuniv added to the stimulants.   Blah blah blah fast forward to today, i'm a sophomore in college and next semester i could get kicked out if my grades keep dropping. i'm on about my 5th or 6th iteration of stimulants as well as entirely different trials of anti anxiety medication to smooth them out.   So you might be thinking "just try the nonstimulants, clearly these aren't working" and you may be right. Problem is is that i've been on stimulants(mainly amphetamine derivatives) for so long that when i stop my grades begin to plummet, like straight down.  Besides it's going to be a while until i'm not required to take these meds.   And well to make a long story short: I'm completely dependent on a medication i hate taking. Short of desoxyn and strattera i've tried nearly all adhd medication.  It's like my life has been built on one giant mountain of adderall, and i'm scared shitless of losing all this progress.   Anyone else in a similar situation?
8f963cb5e04e6fa5daaf1b302c0ae424b7e133094ed74c28bee5d7b5c97adef0;;;Diagnosed w ADHD-PI and started on Vyvanse yesterday, the results so far, and a question on dosage.;;;Title says it all. After insistence of my partner with ADHD, encouragement from a therapist, and painfully relating to this subreddit, I had an appointment with a psych.  The interview lasted maybe 30 minutes, we talked about previous medication (anti-depressants and mood stabilizers) that had no effect on me, or caused emotional blunting but never helped my mood swings and focus.  He was very thorough in explaining the effects of the drugs and selected Vyvanse as it was the first one to show up as covered under my insurance. He wasn't sure if there'd be an issue with age (some don't want to cover until 23, I'm 22) or said there may be a pre-authorization, but I had no issues!  30mg. Went home, took it. In about fifteen minutes I noticed a subtle shift in perception.  Colors were a little brighter as I felt sort of pushed more presently into my body.   Agitation I've been feeling for as long as I can remember suddenly became non-existent. My anxiety dropped from 7.5 to 2.5.   I didn't feel euphoric, but I felt calm. A subtle, almost drowsy sensation (not quite, I wasn't actually tired), that I realize is feeling peaceful.  My resistance was hardly there. For boring tasks or usually high stress irritations. Small frustrations hardly made a wave, when some days they could send me spiraling into aggression and an emotional shutdown.  The loud loops of conversations and idle chatter in my brain switched off, as if someone had turned the dial on a static-filled station slowly down and then off.  I felt normal. My brain was quiet for the first time in forever.   **Positive effects:**  quiet mind, more decisive, large decrease in anxiety (physical and mental), increase in ability to focus, lessened irritability/aggression, feeling more in the moment, easier to deconstruct normally complex problems into specific parts, lessened resistance to work/difficult tasks, lack of appetite (didn't obsess over food)   **Not so positive:**  desert-dry mouth, nausea, problems completely falling asleep (my mind would rest, my body kept waking me up)    **TL;DR**  First time on meds was a HUGE success, and I'll be following up in a month. I don't feel hopeless anymore, especially about the future! Biggest issue was sleep but I took my meds at noon (I work past 10pm) so I'll be trying a little earlier each day and seeing if that helps. It wasn't so much I was restless, more like my mind would drift to sleep and then I'd be nudged back into consciousness. Dry mouth is ridiculously noticeable, and I hate the nausea, but it's a small price to pay for all the benefits.    **End notes:**  I hope it continues to go well!  If anyone has any questions or can relate, please comment. I feel like my life finally makes sense and I owe it to this subreddit for helping me realize I most likely had ADHD and could get help.    **Question:**  How did you know it was time to raise the dosage of your medication? Will they begin to work less effectively, and what exactly would that entail?

I woke up this morning to get ready for work, and he came home saying that he met Donald Trump. Who knows if he actually did because he is a pathological liar so you never can fully trust what he says.  I said "fuck Trump." And told him that I had canceled my shit medical insurance so that when the next enrollment period starts I could get on some decent medical insurance so  I could get on ADD meds, but Trump might have ruined that by making it a pre-existing condition.  So my roommate, in all his wisdom, said that while he was at work a certified DR diagnosed him with ADD because he saw him fidgeting. That's your only symptom and it was enough for a diagnosis? Okaaay.  He said the DR told him to treat ADD with    Decaffeinated coffee.   That's right kids, your morning cup of non caffienated coffee can cure all your ADD symptoms!  My roommates an idiot.

It's like being rejected over and over, every day.    *quick background: we've been friends for almost 2 years, fwb for about a year. I caught feelings around September when we moved in together; I told him immediately in the hopes a quick rejection would stop my feelings getting stronger but it didn't work. I'm not that close with my other 3 housemates and I don't see my other friends much so he's basically my closest friend in my everyday life. well I'm attached to him, he's not as fond of me.*   This mix of me having feelings and him being the person I spend the most time with means I kind of need him to like me, to be nice to me, and he often isn't. ik he doesn't owe me anything, still I need it.    He has a bad habit of being a bit harsh with his banter, he also tends to assert his opinions as fact. this often leaves me feeling like I'm wrong or stupid just because I don't like the music that he does or because I can't do sums in my head anywhere near as easily as him   I've told him about the stuff that really hurts: when he talks about his ex (who he is obviously still in love with), when he talks about his tinder matches, when he gets with girls in front of me. I thought if I told him this he would stop, but no. He thinks that since we're not dating he has no responsibility for my feelings. I think that since we're friends he should put at least some effort into making me not suicidal. he doesn't understand.   We went out the other night, he ditched me for a girl immediately. I think he may have actually brought me on a date with another girl. He brought her home and it made me feel worse than I've felt in at least a year, maybe even in 3. When I saw them walk off the next morning to buy her food so key could make her breakfast (ugh kill me) I considered jumping out the window, instead I just locked them out for a couple hours (ik this is like, crazy ex gf levels of petty but I think that was better than the other shit I was considering doing).   I'm just about surviving the depressive episodes he sends me into without getting long term depressed but If he gets a girlfriend I don't think I can live with him. problem is I've signed the contract for next year already and I can't back out now.    sorry this ended up so long, I just thought this is the only place someone will actually understand and not just think I'm over reacting. (btw I'm not actually gonna off myself, these depressive episodes tend to only last a few days and I can handle myself for that long)  **tl;dr living with someone for another year who is constantly making me wanna die lol fun times!!**

I already know I have anxiety and some depression, and I've looked a lot around the internet for guides on how to know if you have adhd etc. but I've had a lot of issues with health professions in recent years so I feel really uncomfortable about asking for assessment because I feel like even if I did have it it's just going to get glossed over as 'anxiety related' or whatever... so if anyone else has had a similar issue, can share experiences getting diagnosed as an adult and/or has any advice I'd really like to hear it...
7be292529d095779cab4ddf389b93c9f9f5e64fee38c14589abf604a8a96c4b5;;;Just graduated after 6 years of undergrad!;;;**TL;DR at the beginning, because this got long.** Graduated cum laude last week with a BSc after failing pretty much my entire second year and contemplating dropping out twice. Went from term GPA of 1.1 to 4.2, and I've been using what I learned to help other people struggling with college/uni.  I'm a long time lurker here but never posted, really. As I've been typing this out I think it might come across as self-aggrandising or self-centred? I don't mean for it to sound like that at all; I just wanted to share what was ultimately a success despite having ADHD, and maybe other people will find it inspiring/useful to read.  I was diagnosed with ADHD-PI, as well as clinically withdrawn/depressed, when I was 13. I stopped my medication upon starting university because I'd always had issues with compliance since I started taking them, and I really wanted to get to a point where I could get by without them. Even though first year went by pretty smoothly (because it was all review of HS material) I ended up pretty much tanking my second year - I failed all courses but one, which I got a D in. So that was pretty much the push I needed to go back on medication.  Meds helped me with at least not-failing, but I still had issues with finding a method of studying material that worked for me. It wasn't until I had a biology prof introduce using her way of concept mapping as a study tool that I realised it worked really well for me. I started using concept maps for her course as well as *literally everything else* I had to study for for the remainder of my degree. I kind of regret that it took me until my 4th year of university to find something that worked, but at least it happened.  It took me a little longer than most (6 years for a double major) but I managed to graduate cum laude (with honours) which I had been working towards for the past 2-3 years of my degree. This is pretty much my first thing I'd consider as a "personal victory" since having ADHD. To top it off at my convocation there was an honorary doctorate being given to a mental health advocate who gave a talk about the struggles of going through college with setbacks from mental illness, which is how I almost bawled in front of most of my profs on my last day as a student.   I'm completely being honest when I say if I can do it, anyone can. If there's something thing my less-than-great academic history is good for, it's proof that you can tank a year and a half of school and still come out a straight A student on the other side.   [Edit] Grammar fixes.  [Edit#2] Thank you all for the really nice comments! I'm a little taken aback at how many views this has gotten, and I hope I've been able to give sufficient answers to questions in the comments.
f195700759d83210835f392e8ec5acb71c7dc0d4ac00a3ae90a27126861d5ecd;;;I've always wondered how much I could have accomplished;;;It's hard not to dwell on this. I was diagnosed as an adult, and I often wonder what it's like to be organized, to have the attention span to learn more, to feel as smart as those who can focus longer and learn more. This can be a very disheartening condition. At the same time, I'm 42 and had the best physical of my life a few months ago.
740fc81b5bdd1526654290572c98110643d018b13163cbbcb82cc2d79c552d3d;;;Gonna book for a support appointment tomorrow, it might be too late, and having language problem;;;Hi guys, first time visiting and posting here. I'm 24, going to graduate university (undergrad) this summer and my first meeting with a counsellor might be starting in a week or two.  I've read the FAQ about symptoms and I'm pretty sure that I fall into the ADHD-PI, Predominantly Inattentive category since I have experienced seven of them for more than five years at least. I know this doesn't mean I definitely have ADHD but I honestly need help.   The reason why I never think I have a problem is that I've always been told by my parents and myself that I'm lazy and not hard-working enough. And the reason why I'm trying to get help now is that I had a breakdown a month ago and got diagnosed with anxiety and slightly depressed. I'm also on sertraline atm. The GP suggested me to make a visit to the counselling service which, after having a triage meeting, asks me to make a support appointment (no idea what it means though).  I have also read [this thread from the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/17kgly/im_getting_tested_tomorrow_and_im_scared/) and I cried because the poster described 99.5% of my experience (except the "unable to sit still" bit because I usually zone out when I'm supposed to i.e. queue up😂)  I'm expecting to graduate with a 3rd honour degree and I believe if I have gotten help three years ago, I would've gotten at least a 2:1. This is because I always end up getting around 65-70 for some elements in my essays which are not even 65% completed. If I was able to "get my shit together and focus".... *sigh*  I'm scared because, as that thread OP stated, what if I don't have ADHD? What if I've been freaking lazy the entire time? What if I couldn't get into the masters program I intend to do? What if I have to move away to go to a less prestigious university because I couldn't get my shit together?? I can't waste another year before doing a masters degree. If I couldn't get through university, what else am I capable of doing in the future???  I'm not scared of being labelled because if I can get the help I need, who cares. I just want to show my knowledge, passion and skills without being hindered by... idk... myself.  It's funny to think back now because I'm aware that I'm forgetful and careless. So I actively remind myself to take notes of things I need to remember. It works out for trivial things and probably since I've been able to get away with small problems, I didn't feel the need to get extra help.  **tl;dr**  * Meet seven criteria of ADHD Predominantly Inattentive for at least 5 years  * Graduating with a poor degree in a few months.  * GP suggests me to go to the counselling service after I'm diagnosed with anxiety and mild depression. * Counselling service asks me to give them a ring to book for a support appointment * Probably fail to get into the masters programme I'd like to do * Worried, scared, feeling guilty and hopeless   **Question** English is not my first language so I'm worried that when I'm with the counsellor face-to-face, I'd miss out things I need to tell him/her. Since this post is a good representation of my experience and problems, is it a good idea to edit it a little, add my specific symptoms then show it to the counsellor?   ^^^^Dear ^^^^bot, ^^^^please ^^^^don't ^^^^remove ^^^^my ^^^^post ^^^^;-(
a6f395f67442da669e6d6f25a4560c4b66a6f45da92c88871557f8fdbe4587a4;;;Been on meds for two weeks, already abused. Any advice?;;;TL;DR - new to meds, went on a binge this weekend. Any advice or cautionary tales welcome.   So, I'm 28, diagnosed with ADD three weeks ago, after struggling with depression for 7 years with no therapist having success helping me beat it more than temporary. Got a psychiatrist this year, and after 5 months of appointments, he found the root cause - thus far undiscovered ADD.   Anyway, we decide to try meds. Get a prescription for Medikinet two weeks ago for 10mg daily, automatically upped to 20mg after the first week. I mention the same week that I think it might be working, but that I get really tired around 1pm, presumably because the that's when it starts to wear off. Doc ups my prescription to 2x20mg daily, one in the morning, one at 1pm.   Then Friday happens. I'm wiped after a tough week at work, really not in the mood for much other than a catnap and watching tv. Then I remember being told the active substance in the medicine is similar to amphetamine. Wonder if it's possible to use recreationally, google, apparently you can. People snort it, but not super psyched to go full street rat mode. I just want a little energy and the potential for some good feelings, so I just pop 40mg orally. Can't be any harm in trying, right?  Now it's Sunday. I haven't slept for 56 hours. I've gone through medication for 10 days, leaving me with only enough to get 3/4 of the way till I can pick up my next prescription... and that's if I skip on the midday dose. Oh yeah, and I keep hearing very low whispering voices in both ears. Almost inaudible, so not a huge PRACTICAL issue, but still has me slightly scared.   Feel like such an idiot. I knew I lose control very easy when intoxicated - which is why I stopped smoking weed and never keep alcohol in my home. I should have known not to take even the slightest step down that road.   So now I feel like a truck ran me over. Still too wired to sleep, but I am in full comedown. Not a lot of fun.   I would really appreciate some advice here, if anyone has had similar problems. Should I cut off the meds altogether? Feel like Pandoras Box has been opened here, don't know if I trust myself. How do I talk to my psychiatrist about this, or alternatively, how do I hide it? (in case someone has a good reason for doing that) Anything I should look out for in the coming time where I won't have enough meds? Read of some pretty terrible consequences if you stop the medicine suddenly, but I figure that's more a thing for long term users.
677d894670c19f4abef831d1508b4beccdf2cb4c287ea7994eb52aadc157e49b;;;My parents are against medication and insist that if I did have ADHD, it wouldn't be "bad enough" to warrant it;;;I'm 16 and in the UK, and going private luckily this Summer after my exams. It's hard enough trying to get them on board with the whole idea of ADHD (they're only really letting me go private because we are lucky to have insurance), but although people will say get over this hurdle first, then medication, it's something important because we need to factor in any post-diagnosis costs.  After previously being seen to by an adolescent mental health service (NHS), they narrowed it down to anxiety and made clear that my good grades eliminated the possibility of ADHD. My mum claims the lady told her that I wouldn't have medication even if diagnosed because it wouldn't be needed for my severity. A popular post I made here on an old account quickly made me realise that this psychiatrist likely didn't know much about ADHD, which I should have realised after she dismissed it due to good academic performance.  So my main question, I don't understand how it couldn't be "bad enough", and I don't understand how I can get my parents to actually understand and acknowledge the disorder through things like research rather than using pre-empted ideas on what ADHD is. **What can I do about this?** The annoying this I feel like my dad actually has it himself.  &amp;nbsp;  **Slightly off-topic questions:**  - For those of you in the UK who got diagnosed privately, could you switch your medications from private to NHS so you don't have to consistently pay a fortune for them? - If I need to be assessed for comorbid anxiety and ADHD, I assume that I can't just go to a normal ADHD psychiatrist. If anyone has comorbid anxiety and ADHD, could you please tell me what kind of doc you got diagnosed by? Anyone who has done so in the UK would be even better :)
8ca7c12c0e78aca817b8c07d2e8453344381be336548418ebda647a6cfb22d83;;;I just want to be normal;;;So, I have a pretty typical story for a woman diagnosed with ADHD-I as an adult. Smart from a young age, but extremely disorganized and spacey. Got in trouble for it in school, but was otherwise well-behaved, so teachers let it slide. School got increasingly harder to do well in, and by the time I reached college, I was constantly skipping class and missing homework. Never failed because I have some kind of guardian angel looking out for me, but I did have to medically withdraw from my first college because of rampant depression.  Now, I've *finally* found someone willing to listen to my symptoms and diagnose me. Been trying out Ritalin for the past two months, and I've noticed I need a slightly larger dose to feel any effects at all. Worse, it wears off very, very quickly for me. At the beginning, I feel amazing. Not high or anything. It's just that my mood is better, I actually have less social anxiety, I'm motivated to get out and get things done. But it wears off *so quickly*. Within an hour usually, I'm back to my normal state of mind, with little to no remaining effects.  I'm absolutely crushed whenever the feeling of togetherness and motivation leaves. I feel like I get to experience a normal brain for an hour or less, and then I'm back to me and my crappy, constantly-bored and mildly grumpy self who never gets anything done. I even doubt that I really have ADHD, and maybe I really am just chasing a high from the Ritalin, but I don't feel like I am. I just want to have a normal brain that works and lets me be successful, and the Ritalin almost hurts more than it helps, because I chase that feeling of normalness so badly and feel its absence so much more when it's gone.  Does anyone else feel this way? Sorry, just going through a rough time right now, recently diagnosed and the only treatment I'm receiving is my Ritalin medication.
703682efbd79a043dfefc99103f5876e55b9f681afc475f87fa69d7bc8bd5bb7;;;Been having a rough time, wish I had found this earlier.;;;So at the title states I'm in a bad place, I am 25, married, in the military, oh and to top it off I was rediagnosed with ADHD after almost 10 years of being off medications. Long story short my wife and I got married 4 years ago, I deployed (no where with gunfire) but was working 18+ hours a day 6 days a week for 9 months. When I came back my wife started to notice my moods where changing, my anger got worse and I had serious road rage. I told myself I could handle it by my self, my job is and has been for the last few years extremely stressful. Long hours not enough time to decompress so stress from work come home and bled into everything. My wife has depression and anxiety, and I am actually going to get diagnosed with what I can only assume is the same thing. My ADHD and my attempt in fixing it myself has been a complete failure and I ended up almost destroying my marriage in November. Sadly things are worse as of now, I know this seems like a rant but there is a moral to it.  In November I broke down, the stress of ever thing crushed me, and I started reading, some books I read over and over again. If anyone is getting into a very serious relationship, is getting married, or even if you are married I would suggest you read these books. These were recommended to me by a therapist, and may be the changing factor of if my marriage is done for good. From one person who thought he was dealing with something new, and was alone I'm here to tell you that you are not alone and someone will always understand.   The Five Love Languages- Gary Chapman: This book will help you realize how you as a person feel love, and how to love your significant other. It can help you from alienating them when you don't understand and can keep you grounded in you relationship.  The ADHD Effect on Marriage- Melissa Orlov: This book has been my saving grace the past few weeks, I bought it a few months ago at Barnes and Noble after forgetting about it. This book talks alot about how your ADHD may actually be affecting you relationship and signs that you may find not that will save you heartache in the future. It talks about many things I thought were just wrong with me and not a lot of people who have ADHD.  The last one was recommended to me again recently that I could not remember the name of but if it is anything like the last it will be of great help to someone.  Is it you, me, or adult ADHD- Gina Pera  Again sorry for the rant, but I hope this will help you as I hope it will help me, and may it save the relationships you cherish most.

175a3641b3df2b1ecaf37e7ee33f8638fb88bec69342e3392005736449ef21e8;;;Side effects after Ritalin wearing off;;;I was just recently diagnosed, been taking 10mg/day Ritalin LA since yesterday. I experienced some common side effects, but after it wearing off I felt very annoying palpitations and a weird chest feeling. I couldn't sleep, I only fell in a more deep sleep at 6 or 7 am. Today I experienced less pronounced side effects but now that it wore off I have again a uneasy feeling in my chest and I literally feel there's a knot in my throat. It could be anxiety but It doesn't feel like anxiety, I mean, I don't feel particularly anxious, I don't know if I can explain. It's 3 am where I live and I feel I wont be able to sleep again. Why are the side effects so much worse after Ritalin wearing off, is it the crash? But I don't feel any emotional distress, just physical. It was supposed to wear off around 6 pm... Mentally I'm pretty much my usual self, agitated, inattentive, all that "normal" stuff.
8d054cb0e886a4d77b1eecc6a7780b08472b16bc63073243740ebe81e15cbe1d;;;ADHD: combination of other similar disorders?;;;I'm sorry for the confusing title. I really don't know how to explain better in a simple sentence. What I mean is: do you guys feel like you have symptoms of other similar disorders?  I have taken tests and I come up as borderline autistic, OCD, depressed, mild mood disorder and anxious (GAD). Of course I don't think I am actually depressed and etc, just that ADHD is a bit like all of these put together. So to me it feels like ADHD is the starting point, and then there's a point when you have to draw a line and say that these oppressive thoughts are no longer normal for ADHD and now we have to consider OCD. Or maybe your mood swings are too drastic and we have to consider bipolar disorder.  Do you guys feel similar?
6a0a2a93f9dd02a4c2164525c2afd623a8254c6668fa7e991cc4045142c4ffb9;;;customer service?;;;so,  from time to time. you know.2 or 5 times a day.  ill speak with a customer. help them with something and move on. then re-approach them anywhere from 2 to 20 minutes later not remembering them at all and their like ya were good you helped us already. often times ill be doing something service related for them and there just waiting for it to be done and they just say ya were just waiting for that thing your doing.  On a much rarer ocasion ill do it to them a 3rd time and they look at me like i have 3 heads.  so i do prefer when its busy and people move along faster and not linger or i make myself look like an idiot
3da5146d67b3cc7e3e58be9c1b8f07cf38dd8cc23de92973cb11c9295794f402;;;Crippling Anxiety;;;I've only been diagnosed this past summer, so my road to recovery and treatment, as well as hopefully overcoming most of what i struggle with day-to-day is in the early works.  At first, I believed that all my problems stemmed from my inability to focus, aka lack of attention. I was so sure with my psychiatrists that I had an influence on what types of medications I wanted, because I made sure I received it. Vyvanse, Concerta, Adderal, Ritalin, Focalin, you name it. I've been through all the stimulants out there, and did it help my focus? Yes, it did. But did it help my ability to function, no.  It took several days until the racing thoughts went faster and faster until It became too much for me to handle. I went off all the medications and lived sober for a good 4-5 months, and now I'm back.   Back with a better idea of what I need, and a clearer picture of who I am. I ended a relationship with someone who I thought was the love of my life about a week ago. It was the toughest decision I've ever had to make, but It was for the better, and It saved inevitable hurt waiting in the future.   That left me with myself and although I've been depressed and not at peace, I've begun to realize how much I've yet to improve on in regards to treating and controlling my symptoms.    I am an anxious mess. I overthink things to the extent that it prevents me from having decent conversation with people, and really just having a clear train of thought. Rumination is my best friend unfortunately, and the social anxiety gets pretty bad.    I can control it some days and sometimes but It gets awkward, and I get awkward, and I know I am getting awkward, then I start thinking about my actions and how people perceive it, and then...well, you get the idea.   I'm meeting a new psychiatrist who I want to work with to come up with a new plan to treat my ADHD which may be driven by a lot of anxiety. Tomorrow's when they call back. I'm feeling hopeful.   In terms of medication, I'm wondering if Intuiv or Strattera is worth trying given my situation. I hope something works, because I can't take this anymore. It's just too much for me to handle sometimes.    TL;Dr- Anyone else's anxiety pretty bad?

I've been diagnosed with ADHD a few years back, been on medication, then went off it due to conflicting medical issues. I have an issue where I tend to collect things; games, sprite sheets, rule books, you name it. The only problem is, I tend to leave these things up on the shelf and just admire them.  I get very happy when the Steam Sales start rolling because that means more games to add to my collection, great! However, after owning 1,000+ games, I still don't think I've touched a good 70% of my library. I don't really know why, a lot of these games are of critical acclaim, but I usually just end up playing a low investment game like DotA or Binding of Isaac as opposed to start up a brand new story game. I really would like to figure out an ethic that can help me clear up my backlog. Games are an example, but applies to nearly everything in my life. I tend to start things, lose interest and then never pick it up again.  TL;DR: What's a good way of helping me finish something from start to end?

Should I send my CV in my initial email?  Another thing is that I got really terrible grades due to undiagnosed ADHD and depression. I don't want to disclose this to anyone at this point but I don't know how to "explain" my grades if I ever get asked about it. Any tips for that?  For ADHDers who did something similar - do you have anything to share? Is there anything I should look out for to avoid screwing up?

Since then - I've been trying to find out how to get professional help on it! So far I have...  1.) Been through the NHS system - 6 sets of pills, 1 month each - zero positive results.  2.) Talked at length to an online therapist.  3.) Attempted a referral to private healthcare but my work health plan (BUPA UK) does not cover anything after the diagnosis and I'm not a multi-billionaire so no luck there.  I'm really not sure where to look next! I don't feel like I'm any further forward than I was 10 years ago with this (I'm 29 now) and I seem unwilling to get the professional help I require.  Does anyone have any advice on next steps? I was planning to do some research on health insurance providers which *DO* cover pre-existing ADHD diagnosis treatment but I'm not sure where to start. Looks like BUPA UK don't cover this, AXA doesn't cover anything pre-existing - very tricky.  Alternatively - an online service with the ability to provide medication (if necessary) would be great - so far I've only found psychiatry-uk but I'm not sure if they're reputable.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  TL;DR: Got a diagnosis 6yrs ago. Need to know where to turn next for help.

With this list we can have an idea of what we could be looking out for when we play the dating game.  i'll start: my ex GF was actually fantastic at keeping me accountable. She would ask me daily how my projects and assignments were coming along and would work out why and how i was getting stuck. On the other hand she was a bad influence. I would spend way too much time and money I really didn't have on her. I've noticed some girls will intercept my impulsive streaks with something like "wait, surely you don't have the money to buy us tickets for that. And didn't you say you have an appointment that day at the same time" you get the idea :)

How can I create structure for myself and stick to it?;;;Hi, r/adhd!   I've been diagnosed with ADHD-PI for around 2 years now, as well as having GAD. Recently, I've started to notice a HUGE difference in my personality at work in comparison to at home.    At work, I am **SUPER** type-A. I work at Starbucks and feel as if I absolutely **NEED** to follow all of the operational procedures, standards, and drink recipes to absolute perfection. My co-workers even make remarks that I have OCD (which as far as I know it's just anxiety). The thing is, if I don't follow the routines I feel out of whack. Having the set in stone organization helps me thrive in the workplace. But--if things are in the wrong spot, my bar is a mess, or there's a lot of chaos around I start to get very uneasy. I keep my space so tidy and cleaned at all times, and pretty much follow a strict routine every day. I feel in control, on top of things, clear-headed, and very non-adhd in my work environment for the most part.   **Once I am home-- a completely different story.** My car is a mess, full of crap that "I think I might need" my closet is overflowing, my drawers start out all nice and tidy and by the next day are a jumbled all together, I can't stick to any personal goals or objectives unless someone else creates a structure for me (hence why I just hired a personal coach to make me training/nutrition plans despite being in the health/fitness field), I miss little details on important things, and overall drive myself nuts.   Basically, I cannot for the life of me create my own structure. I try to make set in stone organizational habits in my home life but they never stick. At work, I don't know if it's just my need to please my manager/customers that causes me to be so crazy on top of things... but I do know that I feel much more at ease with that organization. I like when there is already a structure to follow, I am good with that.   Have any of you been in similar situations? Or does anyone have any advice for how I can carry over my intense work organization to my real life living situations?   **TLDR: Super type-A in work environment, but a disorganized mess outside of work. How can I try to create structure for myself in my home life?**

3d4f912c55f0ad5b2ffff39b399adb48f03528322f08923608b6b23ebb6cb10a;;;ADHD and anxiety on meds????;;;So I recently was switched from ritalin to vyvanse and am finding that I don't feel any different focus-wise, but feel super anxious and overwhelmed, and at night it gets a lot worse and I feel very depressed. I started off on 30 mg and didn't feel it and just was upped to 50 mg and feel like shit. I loved ritalin a lot it made me feel so normal and I felt like I could think clearly and just felt happier, but it wore off so fast. My question I guess is, do any of you have experience with this? If so did anything help you? I also tried concerta and the same thing happened as with vyvanse. Maybe long lasting meds just aren't for me... sorry for being all over the place!! (ADHD am i right?)

Its not depression per say. Its just a lack of motivation lethargy and basically not caring enough to want to carry on.  Lately I have been fantasizing about different ways I could die quickly. The though of death has not scared me for a.long while, but this is a different feeling. Yesterday I was driving on a empty road and I had this overwhelming desire to just close my eyes and put my foot down on the gas. I have also been staring down from my office just imagining what would happen if some one pushed me out. There is a big problem of terrorism in my country  and when I see news of bomb blasts killing people I imagine just being there. Just going in a second. No pain . I know its a horrinle though but I envy those people.  do you guys ever go through these wierd phase. Should i be worried. I dont want to discuss this with my doctor as he will think i am suacidal.and put me.back om antidepressents. I hate them and dont want to ever go back.

I was doing above average in school but had problems with spelling in English and my native language of Tamil.   I was wondering if in general ppl with adhd have problems with spelling?   I was never able to pay attention to the proper spelling when learning and used to just make up spelling on the go during tests. I used to dread my native language exams because of this.

How will meds change the years and years of behavior patterns/habits?;;;I found this sub last night and searched "husband/spouse" and read several posts. It was incredible to hear the non-adhd spouse's stories over and over, like looking in a mirror.   Our relationship has always felt like me having to parent him, redirect him to what needs to happen, pick up the mess and handle keep our life in order. Most of this I don't mind because I'm a take charge, type A kind of person. I don't care to manage finances, keep up with our calendar, handle the kids medical issues (one of our children has severe health issues).  But then there's the kitchen that has no cabinet doors for 3 months because he was going to refinish the wood, did 1 door, then stopped. Our basement that looks like an episode of Hoarders because there's 800 projects going on and tools everywhere and stuff that "may be useful". His anger from being totally mentally overwhelmed then having to come home to 3 young kids, who HELLO are not predictable little humans. I can't rely on him to do anything. I'm envious of people who can ask their husband to stop and run some errands on the way home. I don't even bother anymore. He also can never get out the door on time for work, which is exasperated by the fact he works for his family and won't get in any actual trouble by being late.  So mostly this is a vent. BUT last week he was diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed Vyvanse. Hopefully he will have the actual medicaiton in hand in the next couple days. We went out of town the day after his dr appt and are now waiting on the financial assistance paperwork to go through.  I am trying to be optimistic that this will be helpful for us. I am in school 2 nights a week and the burden that is on me has grown. Making lists for the nights he's home alone with the kids has been helpful. But I'm trying to not get my hopes up too much that the meds will fix much. How can I help him change his behaviors, like watching 3 hours of youtube in the morning after he wakes up? Or the need to do one small task with crazy hyperfocus so that's all that gets done and there's so many more tasks left that fall on me? I guess I'm just trying to not expect too much.

I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 7, never medicated.   My first semester in college went pretty poorly, all C's and 1 A. My 2nd semester I failed all of my classes, because on top of my ADHD issues, my mother was in the hospital, which kinda sent me into a depression because I thought my mother was going to get cancer again.    I'm going to see my doctor tomorrow about seeing a psychiatrist or if he will prescribe me something, I'd rather get a referral to the pysch.    I was wondering how to prove my ADHD issues in my appeal? Really just looking for advice from anyone else who has had to write an appeal, because man this shit sucks.   **TL:DR Failed classes due to ADHD and other problems, wondering how to prove ADHD issues affected me.**

It might be uplifting to hear the opposite, i figure. I'm doing great, working out like an insane person every day, eating like an insane person at each meal, managing my responsibilities like an automaton, and loving life like never before. Hang in there, things change fast. I'm in the best shape of my life and i was just accepted to my local university, Texas A&amp;M in commerce. Im finishing my associates degree over the summer and spending time with my loved ones. Things couldn't be better in my cruelly lucky, extremely privileged, euphoric life.

We are ready to try meds with her and have an appt for that at the end of the month. I am breastfeeding and unable to take meds right now. I also get about 5 hours VERY interupted sleep at night because both of my kids wake me up at all hours. My temper is short as all get out, I'm yelling, I'm always angry and frustrated, school is out and the 7 yr old and 2.5 yr old are constantly whining. I feel like I cannot be a good parent. I'm trying to teach my daughter how to deal with her feelings in a good way and I can't even do that. I throw things, I swear under my breath, sometimes outloud. I feel like the complete lack of sleep for 7 years has totally fucked me.  My 7 year old is a perfectionist to a fault. She wanted to learn how to do cursive this summer so we bought a book. Literally 2 minutes in and she's scribbling over the whole page, throwing her pencil, telling me come help her then pulling the pencil out of my hand when I do. Which in turn makes me infuriated so then I throw the pencil. Like, fuck, I may as well be fucking 7. How do people do this!?! I want her medicated and going to counseling so that she can avoid everything that I had to deal with but I am setting such a bad example. And I feel like my brain, my emotions, my reactions are completely out of my control, which sounds so childish.   TL:DR; Unmedicated parent trying to be a good example for unmedicated child, both clashing and frustrated.
340c216fb370da6f970963bdb34375e4c200fa45c68402eca682d8dc886152e6;;;ADHD Specialist Wait Time?!;;;About a month ago I visited my GP and told her how I believe I have ADHD. She told me that I probably have ADHD combined with anxiety and she referred me to a specialist and said to wait about 3 weeks until i'd get a call from them. However, I received a letter in the mail 2 weeks later saying the wait list is 9-12 months for new patients! I also just found out that my dad has diagnosed ADHD. I can't wait another year because I'd almost be done highschool by then and I need the treatment mostly for school! What do I do?? Because I can't wait another year!
dd347b573803d171a8d3ea1e6533222bf1e1d63a89fe745a0fc71360bb5d5aff;;;I treat everything as a problem that needs to be solved;;;So I've always been the problem solving type. Whenever something needs to be fixed, wether that be a broken laptop or someone telling me they're struggling with  Math, my immediate reaction is to try and fix it.  This is great because it means I'm great at fixing things and I'm also super willing to help people with their problems but it comes at the cost of treating everything like a problem, and, in some ways, looking for problems.  --   An example - my girlfriend tells me she's bored at work because her manager hasn't given her anything to do. My immediate reaction is to give her ideas and try and entertain her.   The thing is, people are capable of handling their own problems. Sometimes something as simple as being bored doesn't need to be solved and others maybe prefer to just allow things to go as is. Sometimes when people complain, they just want someone to listen rather than to try and help.  --  I think this might be a comorbid symptom of ADHD. I can get pretty anxious about not doing/sorting things which has led me to being this OCD-like personality where I have a compulsion to not relax / not allow things to get out of hand... Ever!  It's got it's pros but unfortunately it can be a bit much for others, especially when it can be received as "you need to sort your life out so I'm going to try and help you".  Also, when I find myself with a problem that I can't directly solve immediately (formerly undiagnosed ADHD and now this dizzy thing I keep getting) I get overwhelmed and incredibly worked up.  --  **tl;dr:** Do to ever find yourself needing to fix problems all the time?

I came across a post a while back of someone going on a Keto diet to combat their ADHD tendencies.  Has anyone tried, and what affect did it have on the medication. Debating trying as I'm on a very low dose of ritalin as we dial in the concentration after switching to a long release formulation, and maybe it would allow me to work back up at full pace.

Then, I moved countries. I finally got an appointment and was prescribed 10 mg of Adderall extended release.  I no longer have a schedule of things to do. I'm just jobhunting and learning new things online. What is a good method to evaluate whether or not it is working?

2a98aaee0106e56d451e1b9fc49ef73aaae3e3fdb0199f9d290c9492aeb05e35;;;Receiving life skills help from professionals;;;I preface this with saying no I haven't read every post on ADHD, so this is just my observation.  Since my diagnosis after the initial euphoria, I've felt a lot of anger.  Multiple reasons, but one that sticks out is the feeling that no professional is giving practical help.  There is plenty of talk about being evaluated and once diagnosed setting up a medication regiment and counseling. But the counseling seems to only deal with the depression and anxiety that may come up, no practical application.  No one seems to be getting that from their treatment.  I've been treated off and on for depression for over 25 years.  You know what I'm depressed about?  The fact that I still can't put together a morning hygiene routine (you know what they teach you as a a child).  Everything seems like it would take too long and I'd never get anything done.  I'm embarrassed and depressed that I'm sure everyone knows how to do this and knows I don't.  I have a three year cycle with jobs and relationships.  I invest every single bit of energy I have until I have zero in me left, and then become resentful and quit or just check out emotionally.  Now I'm into my fourth year of freelance and due to this bringing in less than $200/mo.  If not for friends and family I would be homeless because I can't even begin to think in a organized way enough to bring in more business.   I can't keep house, I'm just now learning to drive, I can only manage money because I keep an obsessive running total in my head to the point of anxiety.  But have no ability to actually buy anything I actually need or that goes together, be it food, clothing, etc.  THIS IS WHAT I NEED HELP WITH.  What I get told is "let's work on your depression" "let's raise your self esteem" and I'm about to lose my mind.  People talk about lack of executive functioning but it seems that people assume that medicine will fix it all.  Yes, my brain is not focusing on everything at once.  Yes, I can complete a task, but that assumes I can figure out what needs to be done.    Has anyone actually received treatment to deal with these issues and if so what type of professional helped you, (i.e. therapist, doctor, vocational counselor, rehabilitation, etc.)?
97bc5394079e9d752c633daa3b794b86f2dc9ef9a4b15c4c223d1eee73515ebd;;;My friends think I'm dumb because of my ADHD;;;This is a rant more than anything but..  I'm so impulsive and I always say things without thinking, like jokes that seem funny in my head and I say them before realising that it just sounds silly. I find it hard to socialise normally with multiple people because there are so many distractions and I'm so bad at just speaking in general, in my head o have pretend conversations all the time but when it comes to speaking I just get tongue tied and don't know how to just explain things smoothly. It's so hard to concentrate on what I'm saying and what I'm about to say next and what my friends are saying, all while getting distracted and zoning out.   So on the outside I just look like someone who's just dumb and silly and my friends rarely take me seriously... they joke about my stupidity, and I know they don't mean any harm, they're just joking around and I laugh along with it, but it hurts so much because there's nothing I can do about my behaviour. I try my best to just be normal but I always slip up and make a fool of myself.   I'm on a waiting list to get medication (I've already been diagnosed with ADHD a couple years ago) but I could be waiting for up to a year, because my country(Ireland) is a train wreck when it comes to mental health and disabilities.   And even then, my mom who also has ADHD, said her meds gave her awful side effects like anxiety, and she's tried a few different types.   I feel stuck and I'll never be able to express myself the way I am in my head. Does anyone else feel this way?
f6cbbdf25613d8f388eb23baa97662641c2c66544bc485fcdc6b936cde3623ca;;;everything is boring and i can't focus on anything;;;I was diagnosed with ADD when I was 10 or 11. Always been terrible at school. I was only ever interested in music, drawing, filmmaking, and basically just anything artistic and could not for the life of me even pretend to care about school. I was somehow able to do JUST enough to move onto the next grade but during my junior year of high school things just fell apart. Started developing depression and just stopped caring about school altogether. Dropped out of high school 3 days after my senior year started.   The reason I dropped out is because I already knew that I was gonna be a musician, so I saw absolutely no point in taking common core classes and thought that my time could be put to much better use if I used it for my own musical development. Since then I've only become more depressed because I spend all my time isolated in my room.  I've started to realize how little self discipline I have even for the things I love. I've been trying to learn piano for the past 3 years and I hate it. It's so boring. No matter how hard I try I can't focus on it. All the time I'm thinking about how much I want to be able to play the piano at a high level and how fun it would be to play music with ease, but when it comes to actually putting in the work it's unbearable. This lack of motivation bleeds into every aspect of my life. I can't even play video games anymore because they literally give me no satisfaction. I can watch movies sometimes but usually only if I've seen it before. If I try to watch a movie I've never seen before I can't focus for the life of me. I keep having to rewind because people are saying things that are important to the plot and it just goes right over my head. My brain never shuts up. All the time I'm day dreaming and thinking about made up scenarios and I have to physically force myself to pay attention to anything.   I hardly do anything anymore. All I've done for the past 2 years is sit in my room and watch youtube all day. I've been on and off medication since 6th grade and nothing has ever seemed to work. The best thing so far is vyvanse and that worked wonders at first, but I stopped taking it due to the annoying side effects. Then I tried buproprion for a while and that literally did nothing but give me seizures. I'm back on vyvanse now and I've been taking it only a couple times a week to avoid the side effects. My prescriber said this was okay but I'm not sure it's working for me. Every time I take vyvanse now it just makes me feel anxious and restless and although it helps with motivation it still does absolutely nothing for my concentration. It's also important to note that I've been using marijuana for the past 2 years and it's the best medication I've ever taken BUT I use it way too much. In moderation it's a goddamn miracle but now I can't seem to go a single day without it. When your life is just so mind numbingly boring all the time it's REALLY REALLY REALLY hard not to do it all the time. I know it's a problem but it's the only thing that helps me not hate my life all the time.  I really want to be productive and have a good work ethic and get my life back on track but I can't. The most frustrating part is that I know I'm more than capable. I have this natural ability for music and I'm really good at it but I just can't get myself to put in the work. I really just don't know what to do. I'm so frustrated with myself for basically fucking up my entire life.

Picked it up from the pharmacist today and going to take my first pill it in the morning before work. Has anyone any experience with this medication, any side effects I should look out for? My goal is to improve my quality of life though medication and CBT. The problems I've been suffering with for many years are: - Low self esteem - Depression (fluctuates from mild to moderately severe at times) - Anxiety - Bad social skills - OCD Tenancies - Procrastination - Anger outbursts - Extremely active mind (will not shut up!)  I've been diagnosed with ADHD-C aged 20. I think inattentiveness holds me back the most. I understand that medication effects everyone differently and so I will soon find out whether this will work out. I've read through so many posts on this sub Reddit and it's amazing to see that I am not alone and how there are so many people out there just like me battling though the same issues. I've suffered in silence for such a long time. I want to start living the life I've always wanted to and I hope this will be the beginning of it. Thanks for taking the time to read this. Have a good day.

I like the simplicity off [*time timer*](https://www.timetimer.com/) clocks, that i have a model of,  but it is just to easy to ignore.   I want something that I can put in the corner of the room, so I have to walk over to it, force myself to stop the activity I am undertaking and take a pause. It needs to be able to repeat when I turn the alarm signal off.   [**Time timer watch**](https://www.timetimer.com/collections/watches/products/time-timer-watch-plus-large) I am thinking about the time timer watch, but it might too be to easy to ignore. If anyone has tried it: How long does it beep/vibrate?  I don't really want an app, but if you can find an app that meets my previous requirements and is simple, suggest it.

Can't decide on a career.;;;I like music, martial arts, philosophy and debate, writing, basketball, poker, pool, the list goes on and on. And I want to try my hand at acting, comedy, etc. I also like to party and socialize a lot, and enjoy the moment, so giving that up to pursue something relentlessly just doesn't seem to fit my personality.   I would say that my number 1 interest is music, but within that I like many genres, and I am talented (considering how little time I've invested, mediocre relatively speaking) at singing, rapping, guitar, drums. So even within that I would have to choose a specialty. Hell I even want to try hip hop dance.   I mean, I'm fucking 24, and still don't know who I am. I have a decent knowledge of self, arguably more than most. I think for myself, and come to my own conclusions, don't identify with a political party, or religion, or any basic life philosophy; my beliefs change rapidly as new data pours in. There's no box that I fit in. I like intricate metal and tasteless industry hip hop at the same time. I love playing basketball but I find it hard to relate to your average hooper. I don't want to talk about who was traded to what team yada yada.  I don't really subscribe to the whole my name is ___ and I'm a ____ idea so it's not exactly killing me that I don't know what I want to do. I always thought a career was an arbitrary concept anyway.   I guess maybe ADHD contributes to this dilemma, never really giving anything a full chance because we have shiny object syndrome, unable to put off instant gratification in pursuit of long term goals.   I love guitar, put practice scales is boring. Then I eventually want to play drums for a few hours too. Oh my friend called about a pickup game. Let's go do that. Shit! Let's get high and make beats in my friends studio. Damn! Gotta finish those scales. But they're soooo boring. But I have to practice so I can play more complex stuff besides creed riffs and everlast for the 20th time this week. You get the gist.   I Guess my question is, what the hell should I do? How do I find my "thing"? I have many things, which I will never master, because I have too many things, and things within those things. I have to pay bills, so there goes 40 hours spent on something I don't want to do. What to do with the other 40 hours? I don't want to have job + hobbies and be lower middle class joe that never was when I'm 38? Is this what we as adhd'ers are doomed to be? I'm in analysis paralysis right now.   My life is in shambles. I have no job, money, or car, my family just thinks I'm lazy still (bootstrap republicans ftw). I've worked dead end jobs since 18, dropped out of college, didn't have the funds to go anyway. Let alone the attention span or desire.   I live in a town that I hate, with family that I don't relate to, I'm stuck here because I don't have the attention span or the self discipline to fill out more than 2 applications, to be able to go to some job I hate. By hate I mean my brain shuts off and I get so fatigued by the boredom, I don't have the same ability to tolerate boredom as neurotypical people do.  Should I go to the psych and get officially diagnosed? I am in a hole here. Does medication help? This post took a dark twist haha. Oh well, just being real. I feel lost, and I don't know where to begin. I want to ask my family for help, but I feel like they won't believe me, and think I'm making excuses, or they will condescend me and start to "take me under their wing" and use me as a covert ego boost. Yeah, they're those "bless your heart" type of southerners. Bunch of baptist Christians. Incapable of nuance or abstract concepts. I feel like I'm in the twilight zone.  Wow, what an introductory post.

It's only been a few weeks for me... I got diagnosed and I'm so happy about that, because I have this dream where maybe I have an attention span and am a functional human.   Welbutrin 300mg: I started on this for depression. It changed my life... for a week. I could concentrate, I could think straight, my head was quiet, life was amazing. And then it stopped working. So I started adding coffee... that worked for another week but stopped working, too. So I went in to get properly diagnosed.   Ritalin 20mg XR: Kind of worked once. Did nothing after. Was still taking the welbutrin too and cipralex 20mg, which I've been on for years. That might affect the dosage needed. So I went back in.   Adderall 5mg XR: Guys, I just fell asleep at work. In a meeting. My dumb fault for trying it out on a workday, but I'm starting school tonight and I was impatient. Hoping that maybe that's a short term thing? Like if I take it for a few days maybe I'll be an active person instead of a napper? I also cut down to 150mg Welbutrin because I'm starting to go off it so I can just be using one stimulant. Apparently welbutrin doesn't mix well.    I know the search for the right med can take a while. I've been through it before for other issues. But geez... it's a pain in the ass. I feel like I just paid $100 for sleeping pills that can also give me seizures and now I'm starting a new semester in the same barely -competent situation I was in before.    tl;dr: whiny person hates trying new drugs
dbddc39ce411a1479866d04ff8e7fcd161f3cabeb62d54bc178ae3be44579ce5;;;My SO has told me he has ADHD - how can I help?;;;My partner and I have been together for almost four years and has just told me he thinks he has ADHD. It's been a great relationship, but there's definitely been a lot of ups and downs! We used to live together which took a huge toll on me, mainly because I found him "lazy" and extremely messy, and something we are trying to sort out.  We've been long distance for the past year which has been great for me to have some of my own space, however, my SO is planning on moving down, and I am a little apprehensive. I have been visiting him this week and he told me that he was diagnosed as a child with ADHD, which he didn't think was true, but has now realised he still has a lot of symptoms. He told me how he struggles to think too far ahead in the future and to prioritize tasks, particularly ones that he can live with, like dirty plates/broken appliances etc. It also could be an explanation as to his addiction to his computer/Xbox (though aren't a lot of people?) and why he dropped out of school so early - he says he "hates deadlines".  It's been scary but a relief to hear him tell me this, although it hasn't been diagnosed officially by a doctor since he was young. I've been reading up a lot about it to see what I can do to help and if there is any solution for us to comfortably live together, without me losing myself and constant arguments. I know there will have to be compromise! However I compromised too much in the past to the point that I felt awfully depressed when we lived together, particularly from feeling like I had no space as I constantly needed to pick his stuff out of the way in order to cook/sit/go to bed - it never felt like a home to me. I'd really like to be able to live together again one day and move forward from our stressful beginnings!  I would love to hear from you guys how you deal with intimate relationships and things you find helpful from your SO? I've already realised my constant nagging hadn't helped - he accused me of expecting him to be "perfect" and I can see how me overwhelming him would make him feel rubbish.   Currently the only thing we've discussed  about living together is to have separate rooms so at least I have a bit of haven, particularly as I am studying a degree at the moment so spend quite a bit of time at home. How can I approach this topic anymore (if I should)?  Thank you so much for taking the time to read and I really appreciate any thoughts or tips you might have.

I'm from the UK and i was diagnosed at 23 with ADD (I'm the first adult to be diagnosed in the borough i live). I'm now 30 and get massive bouts of depression.  I sit hoping for the day I "grow out of it" I'm not a fan of doctors and ADD treatment in the UK isn't very 'advanced' the medication itself bothers me on top of the constant appointments and prescriptions... urgh   I recently had a random experience of about 4 hours with no ADD at all, no trace, I have no idea what caused it. It's weird but time moved so quickly but everything was so quiet. It's left me very depressed, I keep going back to it in my head and I miss it. Now that i'm getting on, hitting 31 soon, I keep seeing "specialists"; I've always been an avid gamer but I've never been able to stick to a game. Watching people who have dedicated them selfs to a single game or speed runners and tbh it carries on to anything, i can't help but imagine what I would of accomplished if I stuck to a single interest my entire life, it makes me incredibly sad.  I just wanted to vent to other people who know what it feels like. If you managed to read through the wall of text, thank you.

Would you agree the presentations are obsolete?  Barkley has stated that he doesn't believe the current presentations of ADHD (Primarily Inattentive, Primarily Hyperactive-Impulsive and Combined) actually exist.    His view is that since 90% of those with PH type are very young kids who change to combined type within a couple a couple years and up to 75% of those with PI type just fall a couple symptoms short of full Combined type symptoms they're all really Combined type and the minority of PI types who aren't hyperactive or impulsive at all have a totally different disorder (SCT).    I have seen here a lot of PI type people talking about fidgeting a lot, having racing thoughts, difficulty getting to sleep and emotional impulsiveness which would all be indicative of the hyperactive-impulsive symptoms.  So it does seem to me that a large share of the PI type people are just sub-clinical combined type now, or their internalised hyperactivity was simply missed by clinicians looking for the classic little boy hyperactivity.    I was diagnosed with the Combined type even though I didn't have the classic behaviour problems as a kid, but I don't know how common that is.  Have doctors put too much emphasis on poor behaviour in school as the primary sign of hyperactivity?    So would you agree that the current presentations don't really exist?

My meds help me focus but are destroying my motivation.;;;I was diagnosed 10 months ago. Went on Concerta for just over a month, but it wouldn't allow me to talk to people... I couldn't be social. Then I went on Adderall however I've noticed over the last couple months my motivation has severely dropped. I don't feel motivated to do anything. I used to be big into the gym and mountain biking however I can't even motivate myself to leave the house. Also starting to have problems being social again.  I'm on 40mgs of Adderall XR. I've tried taking less but 20mgs does nothing for me. Should I consider changing up medications? Also considered adding Wellbutrin. Just don't know what to do.

The developmental delay has been interesting me though. I read it's about 1/3 behind normal and for me that means I'd be around 14. Personally that doesn't seem right, for me.   I definitely have some of the issues with emotional regulation and concentration issues but the developmental delay with social and emotional things I don't feel like I have. Is it possible to have some and not all of the symptoms?

I am getting married to my wonderful fiancee in three weeks. Our relationship is amazing despite being long-distance for the last year, and I can't wait until next week when I move out to be with her full-time!  Both of us have our share of mental health issues. For her, she's been working meds and therapy for depression and anxiety for five years. She's an absolute champ, and I am thankful for her proactiveness in taking care of herself. There are of course troubles with this sometimes, but she is great at self-advocating, and I work my butt off to do what I can to support her in her battles.  For me, my journey started three years ago with a major depressive episode, leading into a diagnosis last year of binge-eating disorder and depression. During therapy for this, I received ADHD diagnosis about three weeks ago. Because of this, my medication situation is still in a bit of flux, and I'm doing the best I can with what I've got until it stabilizes.  I've been doing a ton of reading since receiving the ADHD diagnosis, and I've seen a LOT of stuff saying it taxes marriages, as well as some strategies to deal with it. While my wife-to-be and I have excellent communication skills (from therapy and a general baseline of respect for each other and our needs), I am hoping to be just as proactive as her in dealing with possible troubles that could stem from my ADHD tendencies, including those that will directly affect our marriage.  As of right now:   -I'm building a lot more structure around my personal daily life, leading to significant improvement in memory and follow-through on tasks. She is very gracious with my forgetfulness, and she has helped me build and manage executive function as well as taking on tasks for which I am not well-suited (like serving as point person with the church paperwork).   -I'm also learning to advocate for my needs in task management without being passive-aggressive or combative, and my frustration and fear of failure as a result of forgetfulness is currently being attacked in therapy.   -We have already built the respect for each other's love languages into our relationship - despite my primary need for physical touch and her primary needs for gifts and acts of service, we each work to show love in the way the other can receive it rather than only in the way we want to give it. This in itself helps so much in resolving conflicts that we (and others) have experienced, and I am working to incorporate this into my structured plan of life to ensure that I follow through with acts of service and remember to give gifts appropriately (which I am normally terrible at remembering).  So finally, to the questions:  MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION: How can I be the best husband that I can be despite the ADHD?  Specifically, from ADHD partners, I'd love to know the following: -what are the best things you have done to help yourself be a better spouse? -What are problems you have faced, and how did you confront them?  Specifically, from partners of those with ADHD, I'd love to know: -What kinds of difficulties do you face in dealing with your spouse's ADHD, and what strategies do you use yourself to cope? -What can your ADHD partner do to alleviate the worst of it?  Any other general advice on this score would be greatly appreciated.

d559de5121e80873955e41c62e1bfffa0b9d681567780ec9ee0afe8efb1390bb;;;Is this correct or not?;;;please forgive me if this is not allowed.  so im 14m , almost 15m.  ive been trying to get my parents to take me to a adhd doctor (pschyatrist). they, at first did not believe me. I've been experiencing the symptoms since i was 10/11 but i left it thinking that i should just work harder but about 7 months back i did research and i presume i have adhd, but they just shrug it off.   they keep saying socialize more, get some friends and do sports, the thoughts of adhd will go away. i am somewhat extremely introverted and prefer to be home and do things like configure operating systems and research things on the internet. i do not do a lot of interaction outdoor.   i do  have few friends (not too close with) and i do not go out with them (because im introverted and theyre also somewhat introverted)  then today i went to a therapist in my country(my country does not have doctors with adhd as far as ik but my parents might take me abroad To get checked after convincing them) and idk if he is even aware of adhd. he just told me 3 things after i explained what i said : be a man, do exercise, interact with others and you'll be fine.   my question is, is this right? does socializing and doing sports get rid of my adhd? i've been experiencing the symptoms a lot but they just keep saying the same thing "be positive", "you are normal nothing is wrong with you dont make yourself abnormal", "do sports and socialize these thoughts will go away"
b50d461fbe7ef1e20619a0461a522b356e07ee4b3a4ea1b9daf51e4f6734140a;;;"It's on such-and-such street on the corner of so-and-so road" and other things that don't mean shit to me. Looooong vent ahead, I'm sorry in advance.;;;Fixed the title, mods!  I'm glad I found this sub. I've been lurking for awhile and I hope I've finally found "my people". Sorry for formatting issues, I'm on my phone.  So I guess my original question... I hate driving. I mean, I've lived in the same town since birth so I can drive all over and get where I basically need to go. However, if I need to go an hour away to go to the next "big" town/city over oh, hell no. I don't remember the names of streets or exits and I sure as hell don't remember numbers. I refuse to ever touch a map because my ADHD kicks into overdrive and I panic if I even try to understand it. I will use Waze occasionally, but... haha, half the time I'm distracted and don't hear it. I guess my main issue is "it's on such and such road off of so and so drive" and other bullshit. This means NOTHING to me. I get a deer in the headlights look and say, "I don't know the names of streets and roads and intersections." And then, I'm treated like I'm stupid. The kicker is, I'm not stupid. I'm actually really intelligent, just like everyone else here. It makes me wonder if people without ADHD drive around and constantly look at street signs, because I do not. Hardly any attention span (obviously) and total lack of interest. Sue me! After the initial reaction ("how do you not know this?") I usually ask for a landmark: a mall, a restaurant, a store. Then I am able to figure out where the hell they're talking about. I just feel like I'm constantly beating myself up for not retaining/noticing small details. This could be about anything, not just driving around and reading the names of places. Earlier this year I booked a hotel that I tried to cancel when my husband and I decided not to go and yep, we couldn't cancel it because in my agreement, blah blah blah, long story short, I got some kind of deal originally and could not get a refund. I was charged anyway and didn't even step foot in the state the hotel was in. Totally did not even see that when I booked initially. It's this kind of stupid crap my brain somehow doesn't notice. Or something?! So even though I'm not stupid, I constantly feel like I am. Is this just me or do any of you have issues like this? The hotel stuff I can get over because it's rare, but the driving around and freaking out and not knowing where specific roads are is what really gets to me, especially when people are shitty to me about it. Don't even get me started on going to the doctor by myself. That's a lot of smiling and nodding on my part.   I take Ritalin, (diagnosed around age 12 when my parents didn't understand why their seemingly smart child had all F's and 0's) but I'm already somewhat of an insomniac or something. I have NEVER slept, even as a baby. I'm not talking like "that baby never sleeps, that baby has colic!" I mean, my mother would put me in the bassinet and I would just stare at the ceiling. I think throughout my entire school career I would maybe sleep four hours a night and we were sent to bed around 9:30 and up around 7 or 8. I just started the Ritalin again last September (I was on it I think around 12, I'm 30 now) and I mean, I think it helps? However, I STILL DON'T RETAIN ANYTHING. And I sleep even less, so I'm always tired and feel like a zombie. I have been working with a tutor all year and we have been doing the same math section for almost four months. I think I have it and then we'll move to a different portion of that section... and then we'll go back and it's just gone. Rinse and repeat. My tutor is wonderful and patient and doesn't mind at all, but I feel like such a freaking failure. I constantly ask her how annoying I am and if I'm just the absolute worst she's ever had. She says no and that I'm nowhere near the worst she's ever had (sidenote: she's teaching a 60 year old man with a degree in Engineering who owns his own company HOW TO READ. He doesn't know how to read. He literally graduated because he was a football star, but I suck at basic math, of course) and I don't know. I'm very grateful for her and touched that she believes in me. We work for maybe an hour every day because she says after that my "eyes glaze over." I believe her. I'm supposed to be starting college in September and I'm just understandably terrified because like I said, the Ritalin helps but I still don't retain anything at all. Unless it's of interest to me, which I see being discussed in here on occasion. For example, I can tell you the entire plot to "Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing" by Judy Blume and give you quotes, character names and specific scenarios, but dear God, don't ask me to try and remember how to add/subtract/multiply/divide fractions because nope. I think I have put off going to college for SO long because I don't want to waste money. My grades were horrific in high school and I just know myself. I want to move on and get my life started in the education sense, but yeah, I'm terrified of failing/wasting money/not grasping anything that happens in the classroom. Just like old times!   Then there's the social awkwardness that I see being discussed a few posts down. Me in a nutshell. I was lucky enough to find a great guy that loves me and my quirks despite the fact that I'm basically Scarlett O'Hara, but other people? Ehhhh. They think I'm weird. Girls find me annoying and awkward. I've never been a girls-girl anyway (it also doesn't help that I don't really want kids so that alienates a good portion of women my age) and at 30, it's whatever. I have a few "bffs" and some close female family members so I don't need new friends, but sometimes it would be nice to have people to talk to and hang out with more. I'm mostly referring to work. I've recently been told I'm overdramatic (sorry...) and that I just say whatever pops into my mind without thinking. I actively try not to be like this and it doesn't work either. When I started my most recent job the guy training me was overly aggressive on the register (demanding that I memorize each code for each transaction, which I CAN do... in time) and I asked him to please take it easy on me because I'm eaten alive with ADHD and forgot my Ritalin that particular morning. He said in response, "I wish I had a crutch to fall back on" (ouch!) and then last night referred to me as overdramatic. So now I spend a lot of time wondering if I can even survive in the real, actual professional world, even if I somehow manage to procure a degree of some sort.  I'm mostly just venting but if anyone has any advice, I'll gladly take it and any help. This went way longer than I originally intended from my street signs rant, sorry! I was able to write this because I love to write but if any of you were able to make it through this entire thing, I seriously thank you.

I did well in high school; I was an A and B student, and participated in plenty of extracurriculars. However, I always waited till last second to do my assignments, I was always disorganized, and I was always running late. I had an amazing internship in my local government and would constantly miss work or be late for reasons I was unable to explain or understand.  In college things got way worse. I had trouble attending my courses, I kept forgetting to submit assignments or when they were due, and my GPA continued to drop. I even lost jobs from my inability to attend or show up on time. I am distracted constantly, and in fact I am distracting to those around me.  When I finally decided to try to get tested, I kept getting told it wasn't ADHD because I had previously performed so well or that I was just seeking aderall. Well, after 2 long years, and my GPA falling from 3.6 to 2.1, I have finally been diagnosed right before starting Law school (I signed up for my LSAT last second, didn't study for it, and even showed up late but luckily did well on the test).   * **I just wanted to ask you what you did after you received your initial diagnosis?** I received mine from a neuropsychologist who preformed extensive testing and history reporting.   * **I have a medication consultation scheduled so I was wondering how that went for you?** How do I prepare for it and what should I expect?  * **Also, how much improvement have you seen since you began medication?** I am still fearful of how I will preform in Law School and am hoping on informing myself as much as possible.  edit 1 :formatting  edit 2: I was diagnosed with Combined Presentation

I just want to know how to cope with things in the meantime.  I'm a 4th year engineering student, and for the six semesters I've spent in uni, only two have fully-passed units. Last semester, I flunked so bad that I broke some retention rules in my degree program, and got kicked. They didn't approve my appeal. I'm planning to appeal again.  Anyway, *I am so fucking done with this bullshit I have to put up with everyday*.   It's always a daily struggle to keep up, I'm always forgetting everything, during class I have to take notes to keep my attention but my attention goes to maintaining a pretty handwriting instead, otherwise I just stare blankly at the slides.  I always don't know where to start. I have to finish everything all at once because I will forget them all if I don't. I do pomodoros where I alternate between tasks so that I get to make progress in everything at once. That way I get to study at least one or two topics per subject every weekend, even if they're not all completed.   I've been trying to maintain a bullet journal, but I always lose track every other week. I've been trying to stay healthy so that my mind will stop fucking me up, I've been writing little notes all over the place to guide myself, I've used every single productivity/habit-building app in the play store, set so many alarms that I end up ignoring, I don't know, everything???   I don't know anything. I'm always called an airhead. Because I always don't know what I'm doing or where I'm going. I always don't understand. I always don't remember. I always don't notice. I can't focus on anything. I need some of those ADHD meds they take, I just want to be able to *know* and *remember* and *understand* and *realize* things that seem so obvious to everyone else. Why can't I?   I'm worried about what will happen to me if I can't be prescribed those meds. I'm worried about what will happen to me if I can't reappeal or shift in time. My life feels so worthless, I feel like the world doesn't need someone as stupid as I am.   I remember my professor laughing at me when I consulted him for the exam, because I didn't realize that current density is density.   I remember being ashamed of everything I am, of everything I will never achieve anymore.   I told them that I did work hard. I told them that I love my course and I want to stay and that I will work extra hard. They didn't believe me. They said my academic performance doesn't reflect any interest or effort I claimed to have. It's so frustrating.  I don't know where to go anymore, I'm more clueless than I've ever been in my life, and I'm running out of hope. I've always considered ending my life. But I'm going to keep fighting. Maybe somehow I can get myself out of this hole?  How do you guys cope without meds? I'm just so lost, I feel like I've tried everything and yet nothing works. I feel so hopeless.  How do I go on? T_T  TL;DR not yet diagnosed but saving up, flunked sooo baaad, kicked out of degree program, want to die because fk im such an airhead i dont know what to do with my life, gib me some meeeds AAA how do u cope without it tnx  P.S.sorry if it's incoherent or anything i hope it makes sense somehow hahaha thank you very much for reading until this point  also i was too lazy to make a throwaway, so if you know me irl (since i've been pretty specific i think), pls pretend you didn't see this post aight?

I've been put on a therapeutic trial of methylphenidate, and have been on it for 2 weeks now I'm on 20 mg in morning 20 mg about 3-4 hours later. Started at only 10mg in morning then built it up over 2 day periods, so day 1-2 10 mg AM, day 3-4 20 mg AM, day 5-6 20 mg AM and 10 3-4 hours later, day 7-now 20 mg AM 20 mg 3-4 hours later.  My problem is that I'm not directly noticing the effects for example I don't get what my psychiatrist described as filter added to everything (though I think he described it as a fish bowl or something)   I notice that my concentration is somewhat increased but I still notice stuff in my peripheral vision and most noise, though it doesn't *seem* to affect me as much. I don't feel tired as much, and feel a lot more motivated whilst at work although not so much at home.  Not sure if it helps in social situations as I haven't had much chance to test it out (I like to socialise but people don't like to with me due to secondary school and people bullying/spreading rumours about me)  The one thing I'm noticing is when the effects start wearing off but as this happens over a while I can't say what is being helped and what isn't.  I do have the option to go up to 60 mg a day, should I do this?  TL;DR: Worried that my psychiatrist may change the diagnosis which means I don't know what's up and this worries me massively. I'm hoping that someone could weigh in and give some advice/help.  Sorry if this rambled a bit and for the terrible grammar.

She thinks it could be useful for everything we have going on in our life - I'm in grad school, we are fixing up the house to sell it in 18 months, we have a somewhat complex financial management system ongoing, we both work, we volunteer in a local non profit and our parish.  . . And more.   We have Google calendar and physical planners etc, but she wants to give this sort of thing a try. Basecamp is aimed at (and priced for) businesses and I just don't have a hundred bucks a month to blow on this. However, I've come across several articles on software aimed at personal productivity.   Anyone have any suggestions? I'm not looking for a simple to-do list app, but something more complex that can integrate multiple projects in different domains.

I started with a dosage of 5mg time-release methylphenidate (Medikinet Adult) twice a day and am now up to 10mg twice a day. My treatment plan will have me up to 20mg twice a day starting in about 10 days.   On 5mg I noticed almost nothing, but the doc already warned me about that. The only thing I did notice was that my threshold to start doing stuff was ever so slightly lowered. Not sure if that was a placebo effect though.   Then on 10mg the side effects started showing. On the med, I feel foggy, tired, often times nervous/restless, I sweat more and I get more headaches. To be fair, I often have these issues without the meds, but now they are slightly more pronounced and more frequent. Also after 4 days on 10mg, my appetite is definitely reduced and it feels like I have a knot in my stomach. I haven't noticed any improvement on concentration, motivation or mood.   With all that being said, I'm supposed to give some feedback to the doc on how the meds as soon as I'm done with the dosage plan. I'll probably just stick it out and then talk to the doc about my experience. However, I'm wondering if this is any indication that MPH is not working for me? How likely is it that these side effects disappear and the actual positive effects start taking over at higher doses? Or is it more likely that the side effects get worse even if there might be positive effects as well?   TL;DR: Only side effects so far on methylphenidate. Is it likely that mph doesn't work for me or can the situation turn around with a higher dose?
9753ebf8a0c1efad5a9dcb8eaf9436c8c915dc18e3b667dfefbf4adee1388359;;;A word on ADHD meds and Non ADHDers;;;Obligatory rant. I was diagnosed with ADHD in my second semester of my freshman year in college, and it was a blessing to have that kind of clarity a proper diagnosis can bring. What I was not prepared for was the struggle of finding the right medication. I had preconceptions of the prescription of pharmaceuticals to be a very linear, cut and dry process. I didn't realize that as good as doctors can be, there aren't really tests or procedures for calculating what drug in what dosage is going to work for you. I know now what I'm sure many here have experienced, that it is more of a trial and error process in which you are constantly weighing the risks and side effects against the benefits adhd meds provide. I struggled to find the right balance, switching from Adderall IR (instant release) 10mg, then to 20mg, then Adderall XR (extended release) in 25mg and 30mg, before finally arriving at Vyvanse, starting with 40mg, going to 50mg, back to 40mg and then back to 50mg. All of which had different side effects that affected me physically, mentally, and emotionally and sometimes in ways that I didn't notice until pointed out by close friends or family. I struggled with lack of appetite, emotional supession, anxiety, exhaustion, sleep problems and maybe some slight depression. Some of the side effects were more profound than others, and there was a dark period with me and Adderall XR when I was taking 30mg with a 10mg IR booster. I became a different person in a sense and I didn't even notice until months of being a shut in and anxious. I'm finally at my sweet spot with Vyvanse 50mg and it's working great for me, despite some side effects of decreased appetite and a crash at the end of the day.   I go through all this because when I hear non adhd people who talk about ADHD meds, I know they really have no idea what it really is. I see alot of people abuse it in college and I've had to deny friends trying to buy my medication off of me. Adderall is kind of a meme at this point with so many people who think of them as smart pills. As someone who has been dealing with these medications and the mental health system, I would want to let people know that these drugs aren't something to fuck with. They're powerful medications that can have serious side effects. You have to be extremely aware of your body and your mind because the side effects can sometimes be very subtle and you can be totally unaware that you're becoming slowly more irritated, anxious, and depressed. That can destroy you if it gets too far.   I'm not trying to give a 'drugs are bad' speech. I'm saying that this shit is potent and if you don't give it the respect it deserves, it will bite you.   If you think you might have ADHD, don't self medicate. A dose good for one person could be way too much for another. Talk to a doctor you can trust and get a proper diagnosis. ADHD is often comorbid and can look very similar to Bipolar disorder. ADHD meds and bipolar disorder DO NOT go well together. Just talk with an expert and do your research.    If you're just trying to cram for finals, stick to coffee. Adderall can take a little anxiety and make it a mountain of anxiety. Plus, the science isn't exactly clear if it truly helps those without adhd with learning. It's not worth the risk of making a habit out of taking these pills when you don't know what you're doing.  If you're just starting down the pharmaceutical journey with your doctor, be patient and alert. Take note of how you feel and make sure you have a support group, whether it's friends or family, to give you objective data about how your medicine affects you. You might be surprised by what they notice. Take it slow, you're going to get there eventually, and it's not going to help racing up your dosage too quick because you want results now.  I just wanted to share my experiences with you all and see if you felt the same. I also wanted to give some insight to people who are just beginning their journey with a diagnosis or who are unfamiliar with the complexities of adhd. Vyvanse has made my life significantly better and I have no plans of stopping my prescriptions with my current side effects at this time. I don't want to scare anyone away from taking medicine. I just want to make sure people treat this process with respect and care to make sure they stay safe. Sorry this is so damn long.   TL;DR  ADHD meds are potent and can fuck you over. Treat them with respect and you won't get bit.

Started on low dose of ritalin this April, moved to Concerta 18 because it hardly lasted even 2 hours. Concerta 18 worked a little at the beginning, but lost effectiveness pretty quick. Moved to 36mg. Same thing. Just moved up a week and a half ago to 54 mg. Same thing....EXCEPT....side effects!   Here is the question: When taking concerta, how did it make you feel? If you switched to something else what made you switch? And what did you switch to that worked for you?  I have been a mood swinging nightmare on this stuff at 54 mg. Sad, irritable, no motivation. Just feeling super lame and sad mostly. Or just no emotion at all which i think is worst. Have any of you experienced this? The only thing that makes me feel better is working out. I really notice no change to my focus and its probably worse since I'm in such a funky mood =/   I know it is the Concerta since I feel great before I take it and after it wears off. By great I mean my normal happy disposition.   TL;DR If Concerta didn't work for you, what did? Bonus: is it super weird that it is making me sad and mood swingy?   Thanks guys!

Basically, I've just finished university and graduated last week with first class honours. Great, I guess. I know that's objectively good. I should be proud - especially because I really struggled with a lot of my final year because of ADHD.  I'm undiagnosed so therefore not medicated (was in the process of referrals + waiting lists for a diagnosis, but now I've finished uni I've moved home, so that's all pointless and I'll have to start again, I guess).  Instead of being excited about the future and proud of what I've achieved, my mind just feels like more of a mess than ever. It's like there's dozens of thoughts in there shouting different things at me (Apply for jobs! Unfuck your habitat! Pass your driving test! Get an ADHD diagnosis! Learn to focus on and achieve your goals! Get fit!) and I don't know which to focus on or prioritize to the point that I'm so stuck and I can't do any of them. Like, I'm spending hours every day doing things related to them (like searching for jobs, researching private ADHD clinics in my area, reading about project management, trying things like bullet journals/other goal-setting/life-sorting methods) but I feel like I'm achieving little-to-nothing tangible or useful at the end of the day, like I've just wasted hours upon hours and gotten no closer to a goal.  I've moved back to my parents' house now I've finished uni, which just feels like such a chaotic environment to me (makes me feel like a child again, my mum is a bit of a hoarder (and probs ADHD herself) which means there's a lot of physical clutter everywhere which doesn't help, really feel a lot less independent when I'm living at home.. I'm the youngest child anyway, so have always been the baby, but I just don't want to feel like that anymore), but I can't move out til I get a job, but that's much harder when I'm struggling with ADHD.  I keep getting so overwhelmed and keep breaking into tears thinking about it all. Part of me is like "stop being ridiculous, JUST DO THE THING, get on with your life, stop feeling sorry for yourself" but another part of me just feels absolutely paralyzed and like I'm barely holding everything together.   I don't really know what, if anything, I'm expecting to get out of writing all this here... I suppose I want a solution but I know realistically I'm not going to get one by rambling away on reddit instead of *doing something*. I don't know, I suppose it's somewhat cathartic, and I've written it all now, so I may as well post it.  **TL;DR** Just graduated with a first, but feel like an absolute mess who doesn't know what they're doing and like I'm barely holding my shit together. Good times.

I feel like no.;;;When I was in 5th grade I was diagnosed with ADHD and went to maintain a prescription all through high school.  I remember this causing me some pretty aggressive fighting within the family because I wanted to be ‘normal’, and began refusing to take the medication. Went to college, was again prescribed something to address my ADD but in my rebellious mood I continued to refuse.  I worked hard, still do but was always in fast paced jobs that I was able to handle, waiting tables, then an on site IT job.  Though college took my 7 years due to ADD and full work load, I did graduate.  That leads me to today, 5 years later.  I’ve been promoted into a high paying position but the work load is heavy contract review - and I’m struggling big time, it’s causing anxiety and fear of failure, I read the same line sometimes 20 times before it clicks, I get up and walk around…I need help.  My question is, what do I do now?  I was denied coverage by my HMO and I’m not sure how to get a second opinion.  I took their test but it was a questionnaire and a computer test - don’t click the mouse when you see an x- that test.  Does ADD go away with age?   TLDR, Doctor said I don’t have ADD and won’t prescribed something.  I disagree with that.

Need help from current or former bipolars;;;I have diagnosed Bipolar 4 years ago and am on Lithium and Lamictal. I have had supportive housing, but still haven't been able to keep work. Got into some risky behavior. Before then, had history of bad grades, gambling, crime, homelessness, have had about 120 jobs, none for more than 3 months. Started few businesses, lost or ended them within 12 months. Have had over 500 sexual partners ( at least) and travelled about 900 airline flights. Life has been a mess, failed marriage, everything is a mess. Now I am homeless again and lost my busy lawn care business. I just got stressed out and sold everything and spent the money. I am a horrible manager. I have been taking my meds, and I have not committed crime in 5 years, but still have a lot of the same problems, except no suicide attempts, but getting really down because I can't make it. My 11 year old is diagnosed with adhd or something, is it possible I am misdiagnosted?
